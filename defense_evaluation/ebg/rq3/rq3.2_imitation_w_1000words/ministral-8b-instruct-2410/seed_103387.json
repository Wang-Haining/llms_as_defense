            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "The following paper explores the Biological and Sociocultural models as they relate to insomnia. The Biological model delves into genetic information that is passed down through inheritance, along with various medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural model, on the other hand, examines environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review examines these models and explains each piece of research chosen to further clarify and connect them. The strengths and weaknesses of the research findings are then critically evaluated.\n\nA sleep disorder can be categorized into several types: Primary sleep disorders, those related to another mental disorder, or those related to other issues. Primary sleep disorders are Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, while those related to mental disorders fall under Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other sleep disorders can be caused by medical complications or the intake of substances. Dyssomnias like Primary Insomnia and Primary Hypersomnia represent complications in adequate or maintained sleep, and Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/or automatic REM episodes. Parasomnias, on the other hand, are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities or physiological occurrences. These include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). The review primarily focuses on insomnia and general primary sleep disorders in relation to the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders centers around genes, heritable factors, and the physiological aspects of these disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are crucial for regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study involving mice found that there are specific GABAB receptors on orexin neurons responsible for these sleep/wake states. Activation of the GABAB receptor promotes sleep, while its inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist baclofen increased sleep time in the study (Matsuki et al., 2009). This suggests that animal models like mice can be generalized to human studies, highlighting a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence of this receptor could impair adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implications are that if this phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep, and any alteration of the receptor could naturally disturb sleep, impacting everyday activities like school, career, and tasks requiring focus",
            "This paper tackles three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It begins by explaining what the condition is, followed by the process of diagnosis, including common signs. Lastly, it offers ways teachers in mainstream classrooms can support students with CAPD.\n\nCAPD, or Auditory Processing Disorder, refers to how the central nervous system (CNS) processes and uses auditory information. More precisely, it's about the brain's ability to process sounds it hears, such as separating words or distinguishing them from background noise. Those with CAPD can hear just fine but struggle with how their brain interprets what they hear.\n\nThe disorder's roots date back to the mid-1950s, known then as \"auditory imperception\" when researchers studied children with communication issues. Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari started testing these children in 1954, and Kimura introduced dichotic testing in 1961, providing a model for the brain's underlying processes. A pivotal conference in 1977 sparked further research on the topic.\n\nCAPD can manifest in various ways: trouble locating sounds in space, difficulty distinguishing between sounds, trouble recognizing patterns, not being able to detect changes in speech, sounds getting blocked, and an inability to interpret sound clues or determine the sequence of auditory information.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, experts observe listening behaviors and test auditory functions using tools like questionnaires, surveys, and specialized tests. There isn't a definitive test or cause for CAPD yet. Many tests present multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli, and more advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals and measuring responses.",
            "Twelfth Night appears to suggest that while disguise can aid in sustaining long-term deception, it's crucial to eventually shed this new persona to avoid losing oneself. However, ending a deception can lead one to feel isolated. Thus, one must choose between self-preservation and maintaining relationships with others, knowing that some may react neutrally, while others may be offended by the deceit. The theme of deception in gender role reversal is particularly tricky, as it raises questions like: why does one feel compelled to adopt the guise of the opposite gender? In Viola's case, it's clear that her disguise serves as a protective measure. Having landed in a foreign land, she fears potential attackers and decides to pretend to be a man. This strategy works, but it also isolates her from women, denying her a valuable support network. What's more, she's so convincing that Olivia mistakenly falls in love with her, thinking she's Sebastian. “Here, my lord, Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) Additionally, Viola struggles with concealed romantic feelings between her and Orsino: “Boy, you’ve told me a thousand times/ You should never love a woman like I do.” (5.1. 260-261) Despite this, Twelfth Night may be seen as a portrayal of how deception can help uncover repressed emotions, especially with Olivia and Orsino. Some suggest that Viola/Cesario's appearance forces these characters to confront their subconscious desires. For instance, is Olivia drawn to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does she secretly have feelings for women? It's unlikely the latter, as Olivia seems more inclined to judge by appearance, as seen by her swift shift in affection from Cesario to Sebastian, and her newfound familial regard for Cesario/Viola: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)",
            "The harsh nature of German colonial rule, particularly in German South West Africa, has been well-documented, with notable atrocities including the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples. However, it's important to note that colonial empires are complex and varied, and the German colonial empire was no exception. Educational efforts across different colonies were also diverse. For instance, when the British took over German East Africa (now Tanzania), they encountered a significant number of literate Africans. German colonial education in Cameroon and other colonies was also commended by contemporary writers.\n\nIn stark contrast, South West Africa (present-day Namibia) had a drastically different educational landscape. Unlike in East Africa, where the government actively promoted native education, in South West Africa, the task of educating locals was primarily left to missionary societies with limited government support. While the government invested heavily in the education of Europeans, establishing schools and regulating missionary efforts, the educational gap between Europeans and natives persisted. Even after German rule ended, this disparity remained. In other German colonies, there were substantial numbers of literate Africans, but in South West Africa, most remained uneducated and illiterate. Various factors, including social, political, and economic ones, contributed to this disparity. This analysis seeks to delve deeper into these factors, focusing on new research into the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards natives.\n\nThere's a plethora of literature on education in the German colonial empire, much of it in German and written during or shortly after the colonial period. Early works primarily described educational systems, while later English-language studies compared these systems and analyzed specific aspects. These studies highlighted significant differences between colonies. Cohen's work on education in South West Africa and East Africa is particularly relevant. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa accounted for many of the unique characteristics of its educational system.\n\nGeographically, South West Africa offered a moderately comfortable climate, though much of it was arid desert. This attracted a European population that was relatively comfortable. By 1913, around 15,000 whites lived there, compared to the 5,336 in the next largest settler colony, East Africa.",
            "The category of Popular Music has evolved significantly over the past 100 years to encompass a multitude of genres, making it challenging to enumerate them all. Most, if not all genres—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk—have produced numerous sub and sub-sub genres. Notably, the Heavy Metal sub-genre of rock has become one of the most varied and expressive within popular music over the last 40 years. Its diversity stems from the early realization of the genre's flexibility, which has led to the creation of various sub-genres and further sub-sub-genres, continuing to this day.\n\nToday, Heavy Metal has developed so many distinct sub-niches that it's difficult to pin down what defines it. It has absorbed themes from other genres, originating from somewhere and evolving into the metal movement we know today. To fully comprehend today's metal music, one must understand the metal movement's essence and why it's considered a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nHeavy Metal is, in many ways, a movement defined by darkness. It can be seen as a \"music of more\" – more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. Less primitivism, more skill – metal bands showcase remarkable instrumental prowess. The genre is also heavily associated with drug use, particularly during the mid-70s psychedelic boom, where musicians created otherworldly records under the influence of drugs. It boasts dark, visceral qualities, which were quite new to the music scene, as much popular music lacked these darker emotional traits. Later generations of metal have also drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral elements prevalent in the Romantic Era. Lyrics, such as those from \"Helter Skelter,\" exemplify the darker side of the movement.\n\nThese lyrics from \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles illustrate the darker side of the band. The song's up-and-down rhythm is interpreted as a drug-induced rollercoaster, marking it as one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song with similar themes, with The Beatles aiming to prove they could match the heaviness and darkness of their rivals. The song was released on \"The White Album\" to demonstrate this.",
            "A few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike masterpieces, Henri Rousseau was already crafting his own dreams, both literally and figuratively. In 1910, The Dream, one of his renowned Post-Impressionist paintings, showcased a woman marveling at her dreamland, but it also reflected Rousseau's own dreams and aspirations as a painter. His journey was one of internal conflict: should he conform to or mimic established styles to gain acceptance in the art world he admired, or forge his own unique path? To fully understand The Dream, one must first know Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, France, he was the son of a successful tinsmith and hardware dealer. Rousseau had no formal art training and was a gabelou, or municipal toll service employee, until he was forty. After losing his first wife and eight of his children, he found solace in painting. Unlike his contemporaries, he was a folk painter, dreaming of recognition and acceptance, much like the average members of his class. His late start and competition with other renowned artists added to his struggle. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon noted that while Matisse feared painting tritely, Rousseau longed to create conventional art that would earn him a place among the Artiste Français.",
            "Many a wise mind has pondered the deep link between ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. I firmly believe there's a profound reason for this. As John Keats once wrote in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While much of what we learn in life comes from education or experience, it seems we instinctually grasp ethics and aesthetics without such teachings. Both seek to describe rather than prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty aim to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than laying down rules for judgment or creation. Criticisms of art or morals can never fully capture its essence. Discussions about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for instance, may focus on elements like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but ultimately, these don't explain why it's considered good art. Instead, when discussing favorite works of art or literature, one often hears a phrase like, \"There's just something about it\" before a more complex explanation. I believe both art and morals possess this intangible quality, this \"je ne sais quoi,\" making them transcendent. This connection between ethics and aesthetics is especially evident in literature. As McKean puts it, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality.\" Literature's ability to convey moral values is as integral as it is in life itself. Living inherently involves values, and literature is significant because it reflects these values.",
            "Today's Germany is a powerful, unified country with a rich cultural tapestry weaving from the peaks of the Alps in München to the shores of the Baltic Sea in Kiel. This unique blend of culture is felt throughout Germany, from Köln on the Rhine, through the heart of the country, to the Saxon city of Dresden along the Elbe. Given its rich cultural heritage, it's no surprise that Germany as we know it today is a fusion of various tribes and sources.\n\nGermania, the ancestral home of the Germans, has a debated origin story. Some scholars, like Tacitus, claim the name came from the Germanic tribe known as Tungrians, who were previously called Germans before crossing the Rhine to fight the Gauls. Julius Caesar, in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, used the term “Germanus” to distinguish between conquered Gauls and unconquered Germanic tribes. Others suggest the name might come from the Old English word \"ger,\" meaning spear, or the Old Irish \"garim,\" signifying loud, noisy people.\n\nTacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" wrote that he considered the Germans to be aboriginal and not mixed with other races through immigration or intercourse. He described the harsh conditions of Germania, with its wild landscape, harsh climate, and sullen inhabitants, making it an unlikely destination for those seeking to emigrate.\n\nThe Romans, though they did not initially settle in Germania, sent expeditions to trade with the Germanic tribes and sometimes led military campaigns. However, they mostly returned to their vast empire, leaving the Germanic tribes to live on the empire's borders.\n\nOver time, these tribes began to appear in the middle of the first century, trading goods and skills, including serving in the Roman army.",
            "Below me, I stared, my mind blankly processing the scene before me. Unanimated and silent, I studied the view with practiced detachment, yet refused to connect it to any abstract understanding. Thoughts flowed in and out like a river, leaving me with an almost liquid experience of the moment. I had bought an art instruction book, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,\" to learn how to draw. One technique in the book was to frame a picture within a square, simplifying complex scenes. Looking at the bowl of fruit on the table, I was too overwhelmed to apply this technique. Instead, I just stood there, awestruck. My hand gripped the pencil, muscles tensing and relaxing as I tried to capture the scene. The water was clear and smooth, but the package of brown waste refused to budge, stuck like a slug on the toilet's bottom. With a mop in hand, I frowned at the offending mess. Flushes came and went, as did my introspective moments. Then, I reached for the toilet paper and began wrapping it around my hand like a mummy, creating an oven mitt. Standing up, I slowly dipped my hand into the bowl, as if preparing a turkey for Thanksgiving.",
            "Teenagers are perishing behind the wheel, and several factors are combining to create this deadly trend among young American drivers. The National Institutes of Health highlight that the teen brain is not fully equipped to handle the perils of driving due to its immaturity. Lack of experience is also a significant contributor, leading to more fatal accidents, rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road.\nTeenagers fare worse when accompanied by their peers, a common occurrence as anyone with a modicum of common sense knows. A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center revealed a correlation between the age of passengers and traffic accidents.\nCalifornia and other states have implemented provisional licenses to enhance teen driver safety, restricting driving hours and prohibiting other minors as passengers. However, these are merely temporary fixes. The core issue is that as a collective, young drivers are not adequately prepared to manage the risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman suggests that even 18 is too young for an unrestricted driver's license. USA Today reports that Zuckerman's research indicates a common desire among those under 19-20 to take risks for the thrill. Thus, delaying driving until this tendency abates is sensible. If we persist in licensing young teens to drive, we will continue to witness deadly accidents, and the death toll is likely to escalate in the next few years. By 2010, Baby Boomers' children will be eligible to drive, resulting in millions of new teen drivers hitting the road.\nLegislation addressing this issue would be relatively straightforward. Schools could continue to offer driver’s education classes for future drivers, but no one under 18 could operate a motor vehicle. A provisional permit could precede a full driver’s license, with a specific number of practical driver’s training hours still required, based on the majority of states' current standards (in California, for instance, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult). This legislation would be both reasonable and effective in protecting teens across the nation.\nThe proposed legislation is not a novel idea.",
            "While browsing through the Library of Congress’s collection of early Edison films, I stumbled upon a series of fifteen trick films, created between 1895 and 1901. These films primarily utilize creative editing to create illusions. My study focused on describing the poetics of these trick films, as well as examining the unique features of the later ones. Generally, these trick films of the late 19th century were confined within a frontal proscenium, used no camera movement, and consisted of long and medium shots, adhering to the rule that one shot equaled one film. However, a few films from the early 20th century dared to break these rules by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nOne common aspect among these trick films is their filming within an interior set, framed by a frontal proscenium, with the camera remaining stationary. This was a common technique in early films, drawing inspiration from theater and vaudeville magic acts. Consequently, figures in these trick films typically moved side-to-side within the frame, rarely walking towards or away from the camera. For instance, in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors enter from the right and move back and forth horizontally, with the camera not following them as they exit the frame.\n\nThis frontal proscenium style also resulted in long and medium shots being more common, with close-ups being virtually absent. This method mirrored the theater and vaudeville traditions, where the audience saw the entire performance at once, framed by the stage borders. Actors did not move towards the camera, so close-ups were never used.\n\nMost early trick films followed the rule that one conceptual shot equaled one film, limiting their length to about a minute or less. This also restricted their dramatic or narrative potential, with many focusing on short vaudeville-style tricks like magic and disappearing acts, with minimal story. However, it’s important to note that in a trick film, a single conceptual shot in the viewer's eyes does not correspond to a single physical shot. A single \"shot\" could be composed of multiple joined shots to create illusions. Carefully examine The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), where the physical shot with Mary’s severed \"head\" begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate advocate for Republican ideals. Although he primarily worked as an agriculturalist, his short stint in politics and his dedication to his profession shaped him into a steadfast champion of personal liberty and government. His commitment to agriculture was the cornerstone of his views on sovereignty, the Constitution, and even the judicial system.\n\nJohn Taylor saw the United States as an excellent opportunity to establish an ideal system because there were no native traditions to hinder its creation, allowing for a government of self-rule. He strongly believed in the natural rights of man and their interdependence, arguing that denying any right diminishes the value of all. These rights should remain beyond the government's reach. He viewed the \"state of nature\" as a place where the fittest and most cunning prospered, but in civilization, this should not be the case.\n\nTo create such a society, Taylor believed a government must account for the inherent good and evil within man. He held rigid views on dualistic morality, stating, \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" He defined good principles as those that protect private property, improve agriculture, and discourage capitalism. He believed a government founded on these principles would function fairly regardless of its administration, which would invariably be led by greed and self-interest. Self-interest, he thought, was man's primary motivator, but it was only considered evil when it led to societies that exploited others. A good government was necessary to contain man's natural evil, and even then, it must be closely observed to prevent the introduction of bad principles.\n\nTaylor, like many other staunch Republicans of his time, advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He sought a Federal government with limited rights and powers as explicitly stated in the Constitution. He understood that an extensive Federal government could become expensive and despotic. However, he believed a simple, literal interpretation was dangerous without reference to the writers' intent. He considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, because it more clearly described the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "Referring back to Figure 17, there was a sharp drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. This was a bit disheartening, and it's tricky to pinpoint the exact reason. With the arrival of winter in a New England campus, there's a natural decrease in commuters who travel by bicycle or foot, which could account for part of the decline. December also signals the end of the fall semester, where everyone is busy wrapping up schoolwork and processing grades, possibly causing commuter logs to fall off the radar. Additionally, December ushers in the holiday season, leading to a month-long break for both students and faculty, during which many don't need to come to campus. Classes resume in late January, which aligns with the low number of logs observed. However, the February dip remains unexplained. One might speculate that any new initiative can experience an initial surge of enthusiasm followed by a natural decline. To counteract this, we organized the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a special blitz campaign that boosted log submissions for that month. Thus, maintaining project momentum in the face of both seasonal and semester breaks was a significant challenge. Another hurdle for such projects is that people's love for driving their cars is deeply ingrained in our culture. Therefore, offering incentives to engage in alternative commuting methods is crucial. We distributed numerous prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, an independent bookstore, and even some larger chain stores. It would have been intriguing to see if even more substantial prizes, such as a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car, could have increased participation and engagement. The nature of the prizes didn't change throughout the project. If the prizes had gradually increased in value, it might have helped maintain enthusiasm. Gift cards seemed sufficient at the start, but announcing the addition of a couple of bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January could have potentially increased participation and engagement.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a financial instrument designed to mirror an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets, but trades like a stock. This flexibility makes ETFs attractive, as they offer the benefits of index funds, such as diversification, combined with the advantages of stock ownership, like the ability to short sell or buy on margin. However, ETFs come with their share of drawbacks, including the need to pay commissions on each trade, similar to buying stocks. Additionally, one of the standout features of ETFs is the wide range of funds available. It's essential for smart investors to assess whether these benefits genuinely exist and to what extent. For this analysis, we'll examine the ETF IHF and compare its top 10 holdings to see if owning a single ETF offers comparable benefits to owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks. We'll also explore if there's a better configuration of these stocks that could yield a more optimal Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nTo simplify our evaluation, we'll focus on the top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets. Here are those holdings and their respective percentages:\n\nTo gauge how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we'll calculate their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming the portfolio consists entirely of these ten stocks in the ETF's established proportions. The calculations are presented in the chart below.\n\nFrom the chart, it's clear that a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings yields a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Additionally, the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF's overall Beta. These results suggest that a portfolio of the top 10 holdings could offer a higher return with a lower Beta. However, we must consider if the portfolios' means are statistically different from each other.\n\nTo determine if these portfolios differ significantly, we'll calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalize it to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation with that of the ETF IHF.",
            "\"Dream-land\" is one of Edgar Allan Poe's self-claimed superior poems. In this work, Poe employs the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, which Mabbott links back to Virgil. Virgil used this term to refer to an island north of Britain, considered the edge of the known world by the Greeks. Although Virgil indeed utilized this term, some credit should be given to a more contemporary source, as Poe was particularly interested in German authors. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" highlights the similarities between their poems, concluding that Poe was emulating Goethe.\n\nOxford Companion to English Literature notes that Goethe was a notable writer, famous for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts— the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe's death. Within the second part of \"Faust,\" there is a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem recounts the tale of a king who loses his wife after she gives him a goblet as a gift. Driven to grief and despair, he drinks heavily and eventually decides to end his life, leaving the goblet to the sea. The character of the King of Thule and the description of the narrator in \"Dream-Land\" share striking similarities, possibly serving as a dark mirror to Poe's own grief and struggle with alcohol.\n\nPoe references \"Thule\" twice in his writings. In \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" he uses the phrase \"ultra Thule,\" and in \"Dream-Land,\" he employs the term twice, framing the poem. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes the landscape of Thule as dark, lonely, and haunted by deceased friends, with a world devoid of color. These scenes echo the themes in \"The King of Thule,\" where the king is consumed by grief, loneliness, and a loss of will to live. The poem reads as if the speaker has stepped into Goethe's narrative.\n\nGoethe was a notable author whom Poe would have known, even if only peripherally through his respect for Tennyson. Poe himself acknowledged his admiration for Tennyson when asked. Beyond his connection to Tennyson, Poe would have been exposed to Goethe's work through various reproductions and translations, given the widespread popularity of his works after the original publications.",
            "Could a customer who suffered injuries from slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages if the store manager knew about the spill twice and didn't clean it for half an hour because he was having dinner? A judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer's punitive damage claim. To win, Palmer must prove that Martin's actions were malicious, meaning he acted with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm. She can argue that Martin should have cleaned the spill, as multiple customers had been injured from slipping before Palmer's accident, despite knowing the risks. While Martin's actions might seem despicable, they are reasonable given the six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009. On October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee named Rich Wayne told Martin about the spill, but Martin was on his dinner break. At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, informed Martin again, and he still didn't clean it. At 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and fell, sustaining a serious back injury. Palmer is suing D&D for damages, and we're considering a partial summary against the punitive damage claim. In California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for breach of non-contractual obligations if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud, or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct intending harm or, absent intent, conduct that's despicable and committed with a willful disregard of others' rights or safety. Courts have ruled conduct malicious when the defendant was aware of the probable dangers and deliberately failed to avoid them. Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "Almost four years ago, I delved into a course on Islam at CBC. The class sparked passionate debates about whether Islam is inherently hostile. This question feels increasingly pertinent today. Reflecting on the 9/11 aftermath, I've seen a shift in American mass media's perception of Islam and extremists, from hostility to an extreme form of tolerance. I doubt that in 2001, a presidential candidate named Barack Obama, with a clear Muslim background, could have been plausible.\n\nThe Prophet's Biography, I find, is intriguing yet puzzling. According to historical accounts, Muhammad's life seems to contradict his portrayal in the biography. Past knowledge suggests he forced tribes to convert to Islam through conquest, but the biography depicts him as a misunderstood martyr, humbled by others until they saw the truth in his teachings.\n\nStriking similarities between Jesus' ministries and Muhammad's 'miracles' catch my attention. The instance of multiplying mutton and milk for forty men is notable. This narrative style, I believe, aims to present Muhammad as a humble prophet, relying on truth and miracles rather than proving himself. Such attributions diminish Jesus' life and personhood, as if Muhammad is stealing his glory.\n\nMoreover, many stories in the biography seem to serve as proof of 'witnesses' converting to Islam independently. However, many accounts are relayed thirdhand, diluting their credibility. These stories are less persuasive because they're not firsthand and appear more suspicious.\n\nWhat bothers me most is attempting to elevate Muhammad to a godly, humble, wise, and gentle figure. History contradicts this portrayal, suggesting that Muhammad's rise to power was less gentle and more complex.",
            "The teachings and beliefs that Jesus held during his life were quickly abandoned as Christian thought evolved after his death. When observed in broader terms, Christianity progressively distanced itself from its origins. Today, the world is witnessing a growing awareness and unprecedented forward-moving trend. While traditionalists persist and resist new ideas, they may not have enough influence to alter the collective. Among Christians, historical understanding will significantly increase in years to come. A desire will arise to differentiate added doctrines from Christianity’s core principles. This process may take generations or centuries, but the reversal of Christian history is inevitable. A movement will emerge, stripping away layers of doctrine, akin to rewinding time, until only Jesus' original teachings remain. When this trend permeates the United States and Europe, masses will worship as if living during Jesus' time, adhering solely to his ideas. The church, as an institution, will maintain strength, leading the way. However, theological uniformity will increase, reducing diversity. Between regions, denominations, and divisions, similarities will outweigh differences. History is filled with reversals; Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire, which later became a Christian state. Similarly, our country shifted from African-American slavery to leadership. The upcoming reversal in Christianity will undo history and diversity. This process will be facilitated by interpreting Jesus' words metaphorically, not literally. What has transpired since Jesus' lifetime?\n\nLooking back in history, we find only Judaism, the foundation for Christianity. Monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were central to the religion by the time Rome controlled Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population was divided: Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the majority of common people.",
            "The novel \"The Jungle\" by Upton Sinclair serves as a stark illustration of the inherent greed and self-interest of people. It highlights how individuals prioritize their own prosperity at the expense of others, never considering those less fortunate. Sinclair effectively portrays this through the factory owners and managers who strive for nothing but the expansion of their businesses, disregarding any obstacles or collateral damage. The text paints a vivid image of the detrimental effects of industrialization, as \"the line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". This smog and pollution, along with animal waste runoff, are indicative of the owners' apathy towards human and environmental well-being. The same callous disregard is evident in their treatment of employees, who are exploited for maximum profit, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". Workers are subjected to harsh conditions, lengthy hours, and sudden layoffs, all without any compensation or job assistance. The absence of protective laws or regulations allowed such mistreatment to flourish. The workers, laboring and living in such deplorable conditions, were effectively treated as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Many writers employ various tactics to evoke specific feelings or perspectives in their readers regarding pivotal subjects. F. Scott Fitzgerald deploys several of these techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. He oftentimes pairs adjectives with nouns that don't typically align to create a particular atmosphere. Additionally, Fitzgerald imbues symbols with meaning and reuses them for the same purpose. He employs this strategy with numerous colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald establishes significance for these colors, particularly white/gray, which he later uses to convey certain feelings about important elements.\n\n[REWRITE]Fitzgerald's description of white/gray as uniformity, with white representing a touch of elegance and high society and gray signifying age and weariness, is evident from the beginning of the book. Daisy and Jordan are frequently referred to as \"in white\" (8), and everyone at Gatsby's party wears white, such as Nick in \"white flannels\" (41), Tom in a \"white shirt\" (36), and Catherine as \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only exceptions are when Nick observes Gatsby's party: \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further underscores this by coloring mundane subjects with these colors: Nick goes \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the names on Nick's timetable are \"gray names\" (61), and Catherine's apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\" (28). Simple or ordinary people and places are also described in white or gray: Daisy and Jordan shared a \"white girlhood\" (19), the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"gray\" Italian child (26), and the dog-seller as a \"gray old man\" (27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has established the meaning of white/gray, he utilizes these colors to signify unimportance or uniformity around certain subjects. This first applies to Daisy. After a prolonged absence of any notable usage of these colors, Fitzgerald portrays Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster\"; readers start to perceive Daisy as less of a character and more like a uniform addition, an object of Gatsby's longing (74). Fitzgerald employs this technique repeatedly around Daisy to reinforce this uniformity, such as the \"gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar\" (18) and her \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County is a hotbed of agricultural activity, thanks to its mild, sunny climate. Crops grown here include tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There's a robust market for organic community-supported agriculture in the area, with many local organizations having long waiting lists for organic eggs and milk. Organic farms often offer tours and recreational activities like hiking and birdwatching. This type of operation can both benefit from government programs and improve habitat quality, allowing for farm tours and educational programs.   While organic farming has higher costs and lower efficiency than conventional farming, it promotes greater plant and wildlife biodiversity in the area due to the absence of chemicals. Additional efforts to benefit wildlife, such as planting cover crops and managing plant growth, may also incur higher labor costs. Therefore, a landowner in this scenario might seek financial help to maximize profits and habitat quality.   The land in question is a 160-acre parcel near the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It's a mix of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. This area is part of the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion and is home to over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered or declining. The land was once inhabited by Native Americans and later used for cattle grazing and wood production.   To explore viable options for a small farmer, I chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs for cost mitigation and wildlife preservation. As a model, I found an organic farm in the same area.",
            "Culture plays a crucial role in any negotiation. It's not simply about what a culture is, but also what it isn't and what it signifies. Culture is diverse, not singular or uniform. Generalizations like “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating” are overly broad. Instead of focusing on broad stereotypes, it's more beneficial to understand the relevance of a culture to the negotiation at hand and how it influences these conversations. Approaching a foreign culture means we relate it to our own and make comparisons. Understanding a culture often involves exploring its history and recognizing its prejudices. Rather than passing judgment or trying to change it, one must accept it and operate within its boundaries, especially when negotiations are weak. If a negotiator finds themselves in a foreign environment, respect for traditions and beliefs can help overcome cultural barriers and progress the negotiation.\n\nCulture isn't limited to national differences. Even within a single nation, companies can develop their own unique corporate culture, which can vary widely. For example, some cultures may stress long office hours, while others promote a more relaxed schedule. Corporate culture can be seen in dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. Some companies encourage general employee philanthropy, while others limit it to “approved” causes. Even within American culture, there's significant diversity from company to company and region to region. While some cultures may appear uniform to outsiders, they often hide deeper complexities. Understanding the values of a culture is crucial, as they provide the reasons behind its behavior. If a culture values “saving face” or communal harmony, a negotiator won't publicly shame their company or superior to win. Conversely, a negotiator from a culture that prioritizes aggressive bargains won't rush to settle. Considering these cultural nuances beforehand is essential, but also learning about the personal background of the opposing negotiator can make the negotiation more effective.",
            "\"An arrogant fool has declared, 'There is no God.' This sentiment is first found in the Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and forms the basis for St. Anselm's argument on God's existence. Similarly, St. Thomas Aquinas holds this belief. Given that we must compare their arguments defending this concept, we assume they both correctly believe in the Bible's God. To fairly compare their arguments, we must consider the specific God they each describe. Both authors argue for the existence of God, but neither fully establishes a comprehensive foundation for belief.\n\nStarting with St. Anselm's argument, it proposes that understanding God lies within our own minds. He suggests that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot conceptualize his nonexistence. While this reasoning is complex and sometimes unclear, it essentially states that the proof for God is found within our own minds. We don't need external evidence; we only need to examine our inherent knowledge. This idea is called faith in Christian texts.\n\nConversely, St. Thomas Aquinas argues that God's existence can be proven through reason and empirical evidence, without the need for faith. This approach aids evangelism, as it allows for logical persuasion rather than reliance on faith. Aquinas presents five logical arguments supporting God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument shows that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for his existence. If you know all but one piece of a puzzle, you can deduce the missing piece's characteristics and existence without seeing it.",
            "Back in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would later be known as Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he renounced worldly attachments and achieved enlightenment, which led to the establishment of Buddhism—Theravada Buddhism being the most traditional sect. Over the course of twenty-five hundred years, the religion has evolved from its original teachings. This evolution is evident in Theravada countries like Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is celebrated. Monks and laypeople both participate in this ritual, despite Buddha never having taught about such celebrations. Changes in the religion range from superficial traditions to core beliefs and practices. Both the monastic and lay communities have had to adapt their doctrinal principles over time, influenced by both positive and negative external and internal factors.\n\nI'll be using some specific terms in this discussion. Internal forces refer to influences from within the Buddhist community, regardless of monastic status, while external forces are from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that seek to harm the Buddhist community based on negative perceptions of Buddhism. Benign forces, on the other hand, do not intend to harm or help the community but may have such effects as a byproduct.\n\nTo understand Theravada Buddhism, let's start with its core beliefs and doctrines. Buddhists find refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma consists of the Tripitaka—three baskets—of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka explores the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism, like Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these concepts allows one to end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth. When one achieves enlightenment, lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) also cease. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for living, including five precepts for laypeople (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances) and many more for monks. The most fundamental doctrine is the four noble truths: life is suffering (Dukkha), attachment causes suffering, suffering can be overcome, and there is a path to end suffering.",
            "From 1836 to 1893, the United States and Mexico were locked in a long-standing rivalry, lasting 57 years. The peak of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848, where the U.S. took Texas and the American Southwest from Mexico. Beyond this major conflict, numerous other skirmishes occurred between these two nations, finally simmering down before the First World War. The tension started due to disagreements over religion, culture, and key material interests (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis is not unique to just the U.S. and Mexico. Nations sharing borders often have conflicts over interests, which can lead to rivalries. David M. Pletcher (1977) pointed out that only Mexico and Cuba have such enduring problems with the U.S. (p. 41). These two nations are geographically close and have historically been rivals, unlike many other Latin American countries that have maintained good relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences were a substantial issue, mirroring historic divisions. Sally Frahm (2001) noted that in the 18th and 19th centuries, Americans opposed Catholicism and monarchy, similar to the Cold War's ideological struggles between the U.S. and the Soviet Union (p. 86). The distrust between the English and Spanish, inherited from colonial times, was a significant barrier to friendly foreign relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) identified 17 disputes during this 57-year period, most of which were territorial issues involving border raids and frontier problems. Bandit attacks from American towns were a prevalent problem that continued until both nations exerted military control on their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).\n\nThe rivalry's end is attributed to Mexico's growing dependence on the U.S. (Schmitt 1974, p. 109) and the U.S.'s shift from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico in the late 19th century (p. 110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, I found myself unexpectedly disabled by an illness that I had never known existed. At the time, I was a nurse, a job I chose out of a deep-seated need for security and stability, something I had lacked as a child. \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick\" was the mantra that echoed through my adolescence. Even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist, preferably a bit of both, I chose nursing. However, here I was, 46 years old, single, and unable to work after being stricken by an illness. After years of living on Social Security Disability, I have little left to call my own. Each day is a struggle, an assault on my security, safety, and self-esteem. Everything in my life is uncertain, yet there is one truth I know to be absolute: I could not have endured these years without the help of my family and a few good friends. And believe me, when disaster strikes, you don't feel strong. My point is that emergencies will always arise, both big and small. No matter how well you prepare, some things are too big to overcome alone. I agree that we in the U.S. should not rely solely on big government, as it is crumbling. Instead, I believe we should learn to trust and help each other. The Conservatives in the U.S. talk about \"rugged individualism\" that built this country, but what truly kept our forefathers going in hard times was compassion, mutual respect, and sharing resources. Pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. So, by all means, be prepared. I am ready. I have a disaster kit, first aid supplies, water purifying tablets, plastic sheeting, duct tape for the windows in case of a biological attack, and plenty of flashlights, batteries, candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have the land and resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food, do it. It's a great idea, as is a wood stove, as long as you don't live in an apartment. But while you're at it, get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms change the way they do? Are there limits or bounds that shape the path of evolutionary changes? Even today, the notion that we can describe living forms mathematically remains a distant dream. Yet, recent advancements have seen mathematical modeling applied to various aspects of mollusk shell formation, both in their development and evolution. Our research aims to combine mathematical modeling of Prunum's developmental and evolutionary changes with experimental studies to understand how these changes occur and how they scale. We analyzed X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative traits that can simulate shell morphologies. These data were fed into the software program CerioShell. We created hypothetical shell shapes to interpret potential morphological changes in Prunum. Our results are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to better grasp macroevolutionary events in this group. Shells can be visualized as tubes that wrap around an imaginary axis, or columella, through 360 degrees of space. These loops, called whorls, expand at varying speeds. The largest whorl is the body whorl, and the spire consists of all other whorls. The aperture is the opening through which the animal extends. Shells can be examined from different angles: apical (looking from the top), basal (from the bottom), apertural (the usual way, with the aperture facing upward), and abapertural. To count whorls, first view the shell from the apical side, locate the first suture, draw a line, and count whorls from this point. Each whorl can be estimated to a quarter of a whorl. Imagine the shell as a series of apertures moving through time and space as the animal constructs its shell. The trajectory of the aperture can be represented mathematically, and once formulated, parameters can be adjusted to modify the mollusk's shell formation.",
            "For the past decade, Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have remained largely unchanged. While the country is making strides towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation, improvements in child and maternal health are significantly lagging behind the required progress to meet the 2015 targets. The reasons for this stagnation are complex, pointing to the need to bolster the overall health system rather than focusing solely on specific programmatic interventions.\n\nIndonesia has seen an increase in births attended by skilled healthcare workers, with 72% of births now meeting this benchmark. However, this figure includes traditional workers like midwives who lack the capacity to handle complicated pregnancies, thus contributing to high maternal mortality rates. The progress in this area is somewhat deceptive as it still falls short of comprehensive improvement. Additionally, there has been a drop in the percentage of diarrhea cases among children under five years old that are treated by healthcare professionals. Postnatal care data is incomplete, indicating a substantial concern in this area with low rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain low, at around 4%, which is a cause for concern. The rate is 7% in urban areas compared to just 2% in rural settings, highlighting the issue of inequity in service coverage. Clearly, healthcare services are centralized in urban areas. Another major concern is vertical equity, with a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, indicating that the poor face significant barriers to accessing healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nIn contemplating the next steps to enhance neonatal and maternal health indicators, the fundamental question is how to best address the lack of services. Should Indonesia adopt program-specific approaches or focus on strengthening the entire health system without singling out pre and post-pregnancy care for mothers and infants? Programmatic approaches, with their targeted and manageable objectives, often yield quicker results. However, there are drawbacks to consider. Heavily investing in one area may divert funding and resources from others, as has been seen with international funding for HIV/AIDS impacting the family planning sector. Moreover, running multiple parallel programs can lead to duplicated services and uncoordinated efforts, resulting in increased paperwork and administrative burdens.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their meticulous detail and focus on the aristocracy of the era. Two notable exceptions are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, which incorporate elements of mystery and the bizarre, deviating from the typical Victorian narrative. These elements enhance the characters, providing insight into their motivations and emotions. The peculiar happenings in these novels often take the form of dream sequences or dreamlike states, revealing various aspects of the characters' inner lives.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, these dreamlike sequences frequently unveil Oliver's inner turmoil, the pain he experiences, and his awareness of the true nature of his surroundings. For instance, when Oliver relives the shooting in chapter 28, he is overwhelmed by the event as if he were in a dream. This vivid recollection underscores his lack of control over the events and his desperate straits. The constant pain and fear he experiences highlight his helplessness and the sense of defeat that is beginning to take hold of him. It seems as if Fagin's influence has broken him, rendering him unable to react or even attempt to control the events unfolding around him. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over his circumstances, with the question of whose will brought about his misfortune lingering ominously in the air. The passage also suggests that Oliver is losing his ability to react, as his life's events overwhelm him.\n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” (Dickens, 220)\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in its fleeting ours.”",
            "A few years back, I worked at an after-school program offering tutoring to elementary-aged students. I focused on helping them with subjects they were struggling in, with my strength being in English and reading. One of the instructors asked me to assist a boy named Adrian, who was having difficulty reading. It didn't take long for me to realize that something was amiss; he pronounced some letters correctly while others he butchered, which was quite odd. Adrian was of Latino descent and spoke excellent English, but he had a peculiar problem with understanding the English alphabet. I was his babysitter one day when his mom walked in. She only spoke Spanish, and my Spanish was limited, but we managed to communicate. I realized then that Adrian could read but didn't know the English alphabet well. I hope my discovery helped him, as I'm not sure it did. I share this to highlight the issue of language barriers in schools, especially here in California. It’s not as obvious as one might think. Even a child speaking perfect English can struggle with reading. I believe everyone agrees this problem exists, so what's the solution? For Adrian, it was English reading tutoring for the alphabet and pronunciations. For many children who barely speak English, the solution is complex. No single approach works. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes – none of these, alone, will fix the problem. The key is combining them all.",
            "From the moment we're young, we're told about something out there that's bigger than us, beyond our understanding. Some of us learn about it at Sunday school, others at Temple, or through our own introspective journeys. Many accept the faith passed down by their parents, while others reject it, believing only in their own egocentric universe. No matter our path, we seek to define ourselves through our unique perspectives on spirituality, searching for a light to guide us through the darkness.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said when I asked him his favorite type of bird. We sat on the porch, the rain drumming on the tin roof overhead as we smoked. The gutters carried the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge. He looked out into the rain, his gaze both searching and remembering. He'd grown thin, his clothes hanging loosely, his hair sparse. He avoided eye contact, and I felt alone, afraid, unable to talk about how much I'd miss him. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair closer, and joined him in watching the rain fall on the June twilight.\n\nMy father passed in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation had prolonged his suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors' predictions. I couldn't watch him pass, so I didn't. I wanted to remember him by how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew him better than anyone, and I knew Dad wouldn't want his only child to witness his death. So, I curled up in my bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "The classic \"Gothic Novel\" is essentially a blend of \"Old\" and \"New\" traditions, as Ian Watt points out in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic genre has been both criticized and celebrated, accused of lacking depth and praised for its capacity to evoke a sense of the 'terrible sublime' (Burke). The foundation of the Gothic genre was laid by Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, which combined elements from both \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances to create a new literary style. Walpole utilized \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre draws heavily from medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even when The Castle of Otranto was published, the term \"gothic\" was used to describe various peoples, styles, and time periods, often seen as archaic or unsophisticated compared to \"modern\" societal and literary advancements. The fusion of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" elements and the new format of the novel (allowing readers a more intimate look into the psychology of characters) is what has kept the Gothic genre relevant and fresh for readers, even centuries removed from its original creation.",
            "Supply chain management is the series of steps involved in moving products from customer orders through raw materials, production, and distribution to the final customer. The term was coined in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. He described it as the process of planning, implementing, and controlling the supply chain to meet customer needs efficiently. The main components of a supply chain are: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these components to ensure optimal customer service. Production is the first step in this process, serving as the foundation. It involves deciding on the 'when', 'why', 'where', and 'how' of production. Managers must understand customer demands, which can be gauged through market analysis. Once the market is understood, managers determine what products to produce and in what quantities. The next step is choosing the optimal location for production based on volume, quality, and cost. After that, managers focus on scheduling and equipment maintenance. Production is crucial for the supply chain, with every detail being vital to avoid delays and costs. For instance, I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target, where there were detailed processes for every task, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments. This structure ensures smooth operations and clear direction for employees. The second key element is supply, which involves strategic decisions about core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. A company may have multiple divisions for a single product, each with its own equipment and specialists. Managers must determine which division is best for each process. Outsourcing can be used to improve velocity, which refers to providing quality and flexibility while reducing costs.",
            "Adolf Hitler is alive in Burma, the sign reads.\n\nEllen Page, renowned for her role in Juno, stands alone on a street corner, a cardboard sign held above her head. The message, scrawled in Sharpie, is about the current state of Burma, also known as Myanmar. A Southeast Asian country ruled by a repressive military junta that came to power in 1962 through a coup d’état. In 2007, peacefully protesting monks sparked the \"Saffron Revolution,\" named for their robes. Initially, the government allowed the monks to gather, but the protests escalated into a war between the monks and the military, who invaded monasteries. Foreign journalists were imprisoned or killed, with Kenji Nagai, a Japanese photojournalist, killed on September 27th, 2007. The official death toll is 13, but Colonel Hla Win, a defector, claims it's in the thousands.\n\nThis isn't new. History is filled with examples of governments suppressing dissent and maintaining complete control. Early Roman emperors claimed divine right to rule. Japanese emperors are believed to be gods, and our current President Bush has weekly calls with Ted Haggard, leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary of the Republican Party.\n\nFamous examples abound. The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests saw intellectuals, labor activists, and students killed. The death toll ranges from 200 to 3,000. The Rwandan genocide in the 90s saw Hutu militia, aided by the government, kill Tutsis and political moderates. Hitler's Third Reich, with its systematic killing of Jews, is another stark example.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring impact on jazz is largely due to his longevity and, by extension, his skill in shaping his orchestra. Ellington's piano presence is often subtle in many compositions, but as a composer, he excelled at crafting rich, intricate pieces that showcased the individual talents of his band members. He created a framework that allowed soloists to improvise freely, while also writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that highlighted each musician's unique style. This approach emphasized the overall tone of the orchestra, creating original and coherent sounds for each piece. Ellington's ability to master the individual players' sounds and how they fit together in a growing group enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's sound and innovation, mentioning Creole Love Call as an early example of his use of voice as a jazz instrument. This piece demonstrates his ability to add texture and color to a piece without lyrics, and also shows how he complemented his soloists' styles throughout his career. Creole Love Call, a slow, deliberate 12-bar blues piece with six choruses, features:\n- Chorus 1: A call and response between voice and reeds, starting smooth and melodic, transitioning to a rougher sound.\n- Chorus 2: A muted trumpet solo by the reeds, elaborating on the basic melody with extended blue notes.\n- Chorus 3: A sweeping clarinet solo in the high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\n- Chorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by brass and reed sections.\n- Chorus 5: The climactic chorus, where reeds initiate the call and response in the high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\n- Chorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with a \"growl\" solo by the voice.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add tone color in this piece is just one example of a stylistic trait that runs throughout his work. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing uses Miley's vocal elements and Cox's instrumental voice to create a rich, complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) further extends these ideas, with Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a key member of Ellington's orchestra, introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "She had always felt an emptiness inside, a yearning for something that wouldn't be filled. It began at 14, when she was discovering her teenage life, and it stayed with her at 17. She had decided she wanted a person, not an object, yet no one appealed to her. Boys would sometimes be attracted to her, but she felt no interest. She often questioned this, trying to figure out what could cause such a sensation in a teenage girl. Years of contemplation brought several theories, but nothing solid enough to speculate on. So she lived her life, continually puzzling over her desires.\n\nA quiet day at home was usually peaceful. Her parents were calm and never argued, and arguments with her were rare. They'd only disagree about her asserting her independence and lively personality. She was quite likeable, even with her parents, due to her energetic and kind nature.\n\nToday, though, was not peaceful. As she wandered from room to room seeking inspiration, she heard a sudden scream from the kitchen, her mother's voice. She rushed in, panicking, \"Mom?! What's wrong?!\" She saw her mother on the floor, moaning \"Ow,\" in short breaths. Her daughter rushed to her side and placed a hand on her to help. \"Ouch ... sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital.\" The words were rushed and strained, and her daughter understood her immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I should pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands, and at that moment, the hero of the house was grateful for her strength.

            "This research aimed to demonstrate that sticking to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as indicated by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is linked to a reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke mortality. The aMed diet is a modified Med diet, characterized by higher consumption of plant foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, monounsaturated fats compared to saturated fats, and fish, with lower intake of animal products and saturated fats. It also allows for moderate alcohol consumption.\n\nPrevious studies showed that adhering to the Med diet was associated with a lower risk of total and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, and an intervention trial found it more effective than a low-fat diet for weight loss and cholesterol ratio reduction in obese individuals. However, these studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study followed 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without a history of CVD or diabetes from the Nurses' Health Study, involving 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. They assessed an aMed diet score using six self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (FFQs) between 1984 and 2004 to evaluate nutrient intake over the preceding year. Over 95% of nurses maintained participation throughout the 20-year period. FFQs underwent validation, and reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed via medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. Where records were unavailable, cases were classed as “probable” (around 17% of strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts). The study adjusted for factors like body mass index, smoking, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, alcohol intake, and physical activity.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to examine the link between an aMed score and CHD and stroke risk, separately considering fatal and nonfatal types. Greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was linked to a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, they found 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths. Women in the top aMed quintile had a lower risk of both CHD and stroke than those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In 2007, the United States of America was hit by a severe financial crisis. Unemployment surged, the housing market imploded, and many of the nation's largest and most significant corporations were left shattered. This recession continues to this day, so we must ponder the following: how did this crisis occur, and how can we prevent it from happening again? In short, the financial crisis was sparked by self-serving and ignorant political decisions that coerced banks and firms to issue sub-prime loans into an insecure and inadequate financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwrite and repack these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks lacked sufficient capital reserves and passed on the chaos to the repacked mortgages they had sold, and subsequently, to the broader economy.\n\nThe financial crisis’s seeds were sown in 1999 during the Clinton era, as the President sought a second term by boosting his popularity. To achieve this, the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, paving the way for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's largest mortgage underwriter, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate-income people and felt pressure from shareholders to maintain its remarkable growth in profits.” Holmes accurately predicted the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As mentioned earlier, and as Holmes foresaw, imprudent lending would indeed lead to the economy’s collapse.\n\nSeveral factors combined to plunge the economy into chaos, one of which was the novel and intricate structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were extensively used in the years preceding the crisis, further entangling more sectors of the economy in the housing market. This led to U.S. households and financial markets generally becoming excessively exposed to the housing market, making them extremely susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had purchased these mortgage-backed securities were left in ruins. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion dollars in mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a significant discount, Lehman Brothers was dissolved, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were compelled to become commercial banks under intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie held $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",

As you're reading a story, you're told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to take two pages, with both he and she only getting two lines of dialogue each. You'd expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, showing through his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you'd expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case). A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on. You'd mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you'd expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat. Sometimes it's tempting to rush past certain things. Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and",
            "I caught two broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first, aired live by NBC 4 today (August 13, 2011), reported a man named Shad Hostettler had stabbed his wife in Ashley, Ohio. Her name wasn't mentioned, but they showed his mug shot—he looked downright sinister. They devoted about two minutes to this story, which I believe was appropriate given its ongoing nature. The second story was about an early morning shooting in the Sharon Woods area, critically injuring 18-year-old Travis Buyers. No arrests had been made, and the SWAT team was investigating. This story seemed brief, and I suspect it might have been due to the fact it involved a minority neighborhood. Over the years, I've noticed minorities often receive scant media coverage when they're crime victims. Conversely, if a white child or adult is involved, the media goes into overdrive. Another story focused on a bullet hole in a Med-Flight helicopter, which was determined to be from a .22 caliber rifle shot. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest. Next up was a weather forecast for Saturday's afternoon thunderstorms, with temperatures expected to stay mid- to low-eighties over the weekend. A brief story followed about a Clime Road UDF robbery by a dark-skinned, six-foot tall, 150-pound suspect wearing a hoodie. I found it odd they emphasized his skin color so much. Lastly, a story about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin, was reported. He was sentenced to 300 months (25 years) for conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana to Ohio from Texas. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, which I believed was unnecessary to the story.",
            "There's a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lies a mix of emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers understand each other more than anyone else can, and when they look at their brother, they see a reflection of themselves. This bond is tested during dire situations, revealing the good or evil within. These emotions come with a cost, affecting how we interpret our own actions and their consequences. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers explore this theme and its intense emotions. They journey through a vivid landscape, but bitterness and pride collide in the climax, and only one brother survives. The story is told through Doodle's characterization and his interactions with his older brother, as well as the narrator's perspective, highlighting Doodle's complex feelings and his view of the world, which greatly influence his actions.\n\nDoodle's actions are driven by his pride. From their first outing together to their final, fateful adventure, Doodle feels resentment towards his younger brother. He wanted someone to teach his worldly skills to, like holding his breath, running, jumping, or climbing vines in Old Woman Swamp. He wanted a brother to race to Horsehead Landing and perch with him in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn. However, Doodle was born with a weak heart, making it nearly impossible for him to participate in vigorous activities. This crushes the young protagonist's dreams and even triggers thoughts of infanticide, showing a moment of dark realization. Yet, when Doodle smiles at him, the young protagonist's heart melts, revealing an underlying love.",
            "The human brain is quite an intricate and imaginative information-processing system. As technology has evolved from primitive to modern, so have the ways we describe the brain. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, a book, and most recently, a computer. Remember that while these metaphors can be helpful, they also have their limitations and can lead to misconceptions. Information processing begins with data from the sensory organs, which turn physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, or light particles into electrochemical signals. The brain then continually processes this data in both a bottom-up and top-down manner. For instance, when looking at an image of a black box on a white background, the brain combines simple bits of information like color, orientation, and where the edges are to recognize it as a box. Meanwhile, top-down processing can speed up this recognition by using previous decisions to identify it as a black box rather than a hole. Once information is processed, an attention filter determines its importance and directs it to relevant cognitive processes. For example, while walking through a field of grass, you won't notice each blade individually because of a healthy attention filter. However, your brain can pick out your name even in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and attention continually modulates the results. To process information, the brain must first store it. There are different types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. Information is encoded based on its type, such as structurally for written words, phonemically for spoken words, or semantically for their meanings. Working memory, lasting around 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through specific neurons, while long-term memory is thought to be held in certain protein structures. The way knowledge is organized in the brain varies among models, such as those based on human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that concepts are represented by nodes, linked based on their relatedness. For example, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley critiques the impending peril of both technology and the capitalist system that upholds it through the dystopian society depicted in Brave New World. The populace prioritizes collective well-being over individuality and is programmed from birth to seek immediate gratification. The citizens are revealed as pawns in a grand scheme orchestrated by the World Controller, their actions dictated by a single ideology. Analyzing the text through a Marxist lens, one discerns Huxley's mistrust of the developing economic landscape of his era. Key Marxist terms like homogeny and reification underscore the novel's commentary on the flaws in the rising economy. Capitalism is mocked through the concept of false consciousness, where the common people are kept ignorant of their true economic relations, fixated on their own interests. This result is due to the ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, evident through the conditioning of Brave New World's citizens. The lower classes, Delta, Gamma, et al., lack true autonomy; hypnopædia reinforces a drive to consume and indulge, manipulated by the World Controller. Hegemony, where social classes are dominated by a ruling few, is clearly present. The common classes, unaware of their manipulation, 'buy into an ideology that supports the structure' (i.e. capitalism and consumerism). Upper classes, while aware, accept their place, with few exceptions like Bernard. The interactions between social classes, explored in greater detail, reflect the perceived oppression of capitalism. Relationships between individuals do not exist in Brave New World. Characters lack depth, even among major figures, suggesting technology and capitalism strip man of free will and expression. Emotions are kept superficial, as evidenced by male remarks on women's physical appearance and women's casual talk about their encounters. Societal classes' complacency with their hierarchical status reveals the socioeconomic impact of capitalism. Their absolute conformity to their communal roles mirrors Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely empowered by their consumption and obedience to their peers.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for nearly three years now, or roughly four and a half semesters. Like many others, I've found navigating the campus a bit of a hassle. Freshman year, I was assigned to an East Halls dorm, practically the farthest point from the rest of the campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traversing from my home in Stuart Hall to classes like those in the Willard building, situated right in the heart of campus, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially in the often harsh weather conditions of State College. Upon speaking with an alum not much older than myself, I discovered that not too long ago, the East Halls dorms were isolated from the main campus by expansive tracts of unused land. Today, those empty spaces have been transformed into sports fields, new buildings such as the Creamery and the health services center, and are now surrounded by apartments. As our campus continues to grow, getting from one place to another becomes increasingly challenging. What's the best solution to this problem? On a college campus, it's the bicycle. However, bikes alone won't solve the issue; students need to use them, and the campus must be designed with biking in mind.\n\nRecently, I chatted with a friend who had taken up cycling again after a few years. He mentioned that he couldn't believe he ever stopped. “Bikes are fantastic,” he said, “they were uncool for a while, but they're the only way to get around.” Apart from being great for your health, bicycling is the most efficient means of travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a bit of exercise can take you 30 miles or more. Now that I live off campus, as far from the center as some dorms, the wisest decision I made this year was to purchase a bike. My daily class in Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from my home, can be reduced to 5 minutes if I pedal quickly. The only downside is that the most direct route to Thomas, Pollock Road, isn't always the easiest path to cycle on. While walking has its merits, I simply don't have the time to walk. Without my bike, walking would be my only reliable way to get to class. This would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my daily commute, totaling over two and a half hours each week. Add to that the time I'd need to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and other commitments, and that's more time than I can spare."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced.

            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",

To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1).

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

My contributions to the social work field would include: service, respect, ethical standing, and a dedication to fostering better relationships and continuously improving my own professional skills. These principles aren't just key for social workers; they are personal values for me.\n\nI've always yearned to help others, yet I was uncertain of the right career path. Throughout high school and college, I witnessed folks shying away from problems in denial and using ineffective coping methods. These situations inspired me to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still uncertain of a career path, I took a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. One summer day, a friend introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy visiting her, nervous and seeking refuge from his abusive parents. The next day, I learned he'd called the police. To offer help, I visited his parents' residence. I privately shared my concerns with the police, who then asked me to speak with the parents since legal options were limited. The parents seemed anxious and claimed their son was ‘manipulative.’ This experience sparked my serious consideration of a social work career to assist families dealing with ‘simple’ disputes.\n\nA crucial value for social work is social justice. Our society proclaims the importance of the individual yet often follows archaic traditions rather than true uniqueness. If we mourn lost individuals, why strive to be like ‘everyone else’? I uphold individuality and have protested social injustice throughout my schooling: changing my hair color, dressing uniquely, piercing ears beyond tradition, joining GSBA, and combating racism and discrimination. I'll keep fighting for social justice.",
            "The following paper explores the Biological and Sociocultural models as they relate to insomnia. The Biological model delves into genetic information that is passed down through inheritance, along with various medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural model, on the other hand, examines environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review examines these models and explains each piece of research chosen to further clarify and connect them. The strengths and weaknesses of the research findings are then critically evaluated.\n\nA sleep disorder can be categorized into several types: Primary sleep disorders, those related to another mental disorder, or those related to other issues. Primary sleep disorders are Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, while those related to mental disorders fall under Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other sleep disorders can be caused by medical complications or the intake of substances. Dyssomnias like Primary Insomnia and Primary Hypersomnia represent complications in adequate or maintained sleep, and Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/or automatic REM episodes. Parasomnias, on the other hand, are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities or physiological occurrences. These include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). The review primarily focuses on insomnia and general primary sleep disorders in relation to the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders centers around genes, heritable factors, and the physiological aspects of these disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are crucial for regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study involving mice found that there are specific GABAB receptors on orexin neurons responsible for these sleep/wake states. Activation of the GABAB receptor promotes sleep, while its inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist baclofen increased sleep time in the study (Matsuki et al., 2009). This suggests that animal models like mice can be generalized to human studies, highlighting a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence of this receptor could impair adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implications are that if this phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep, and any alteration of the receptor could naturally disturb sleep, impacting everyday activities like school, career, and tasks requiring focus",
            "This paper tackles three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It begins by explaining what the condition is, followed by the process of diagnosis, including common signs. Lastly, it offers ways teachers in mainstream classrooms can support students with CAPD.\n\nCAPD, or Auditory Processing Disorder, refers to how the central nervous system (CNS) processes and uses auditory information. More precisely, it's about the brain's ability to process sounds it hears, such as separating words or distinguishing them from background noise. Those with CAPD can hear just fine but struggle with how their brain interprets what they hear.\n\nThe disorder's roots date back to the mid-1950s, known then as \"auditory imperception\" when researchers studied children with communication issues. Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari started testing these children in 1954, and Kimura introduced dichotic testing in 1961, providing a model for the brain's underlying processes. A pivotal conference in 1977 sparked further research on the topic.\n\nCAPD can manifest in various ways: trouble locating sounds in space, difficulty distinguishing between sounds, trouble recognizing patterns, not being able to detect changes in speech, sounds getting blocked, and an inability to interpret sound clues or determine the sequence of auditory information.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, experts observe listening behaviors and test auditory functions using tools like questionnaires, surveys, and specialized tests. There isn't a definitive test or cause for CAPD yet. Many tests present multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli, and more advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals and measuring responses.",
            "Twelfth Night appears to suggest that while disguise can aid in sustaining long-term deception, it's crucial to eventually shed this new persona to avoid losing oneself. However, ending a deception can lead one to feel isolated. Thus, one must choose between self-preservation and maintaining relationships with others, knowing that some may react neutrally, while others may be offended by the deceit. The theme of deception in gender role reversal is particularly tricky, as it raises questions like: why does one feel compelled to adopt the guise of the opposite gender? In Viola's case, it's clear that her disguise serves as a protective measure. Having landed in a foreign land, she fears potential attackers and decides to pretend to be a man. This strategy works, but it also isolates her from women, denying her a valuable support network. What's more, she's so convincing that Olivia mistakenly falls in love with her, thinking she's Sebastian. “Here, my lord, Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) Additionally, Viola struggles with concealed romantic feelings between her and Orsino: “Boy, you’ve told me a thousand times/ You should never love a woman like I do.” (5.1. 260-261) Despite this, Twelfth Night may be seen as a portrayal of how deception can help uncover repressed emotions, especially with Olivia and Orsino. Some suggest that Viola/Cesario's appearance forces these characters to confront their subconscious desires. For instance, is Olivia drawn to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does she secretly have feelings for women? It's unlikely the latter, as Olivia seems more inclined to judge by appearance, as seen by her swift shift in affection from Cesario to Sebastian, and her newfound familial regard for Cesario/Viola: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)",
            "The harsh nature of German colonial rule, particularly in German South West Africa, has been well-documented, with notable atrocities including the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples. However, it's important to note that colonial empires are complex and varied, and the German colonial empire was no exception. Educational efforts across different colonies were also diverse. For instance, when the British took over German East Africa (now Tanzania), they encountered a significant number of literate Africans. German colonial education in Cameroon and other colonies was also commended by contemporary writers.\n\nIn stark contrast, South West Africa (present-day Namibia) had a drastically different educational landscape. Unlike in East Africa, where the government actively promoted native education, in South West Africa, the task of educating locals was primarily left to missionary societies with limited government support. While the government invested heavily in the education of Europeans, establishing schools and regulating missionary efforts, the educational gap between Europeans and natives persisted. Even after German rule ended, this disparity remained. In other German colonies, there were substantial numbers of literate Africans, but in South West Africa, most remained uneducated and illiterate. Various factors, including social, political, and economic ones, contributed to this disparity. This analysis seeks to delve deeper into these factors, focusing on new research into the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards natives.\n\nThere's a plethora of literature on education in the German colonial empire, much of it in German and written during or shortly after the colonial period. Early works primarily described educational systems, while later English-language studies compared these systems and analyzed specific aspects. These studies highlighted significant differences between colonies. Cohen's work on education in South West Africa and East Africa is particularly relevant. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa accounted for many of the unique characteristics of its educational system.\n\nGeographically, South West Africa offered a moderately comfortable climate, though much of it was arid desert. This attracted a European population that was relatively comfortable. By 1913, around 15,000 whites lived there, compared to the 5,336 in the next largest settler colony, East Africa.",
            "The category of Popular Music has evolved significantly over the past 100 years to encompass a multitude of genres, making it challenging to enumerate them all. Most, if not all genres—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk—have produced numerous sub and sub-sub genres. Notably, the Heavy Metal sub-genre of rock has become one of the most varied and expressive within popular music over the last 40 years. Its diversity stems from the early realization of the genre's flexibility, which has led to the creation of various sub-genres and further sub-sub-genres, continuing to this day.\n\nToday, Heavy Metal has developed so many distinct sub-niches that it's difficult to pin down what defines it. It has absorbed themes from other genres, originating from somewhere and evolving into the metal movement we know today. To fully comprehend today's metal music, one must understand the metal movement's essence and why it's considered a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nHeavy Metal is, in many ways, a movement defined by darkness. It can be seen as a \"music of more\" – more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. Less primitivism, more skill – metal bands showcase remarkable instrumental prowess. The genre is also heavily associated with drug use, particularly during the mid-70s psychedelic boom, where musicians created otherworldly records under the influence of drugs. It boasts dark, visceral qualities, which were quite new to the music scene, as much popular music lacked these darker emotional traits. Later generations of metal have also drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral elements prevalent in the Romantic Era. Lyrics, such as those from \"Helter Skelter,\" exemplify the darker side of the movement.\n\nThese lyrics from \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles illustrate the darker side of the band. The song's up-and-down rhythm is interpreted as a drug-induced rollercoaster, marking it as one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song with similar themes, with The Beatles aiming to prove they could match the heaviness and darkness of their rivals. The song was released on \"The White Album\" to demonstrate this.",
            "A few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike masterpieces, Henri Rousseau was already crafting his own dreams, both literally and figuratively. In 1910, The Dream, one of his renowned Post-Impressionist paintings, showcased a woman marveling at her dreamland, but it also reflected Rousseau's own dreams and aspirations as a painter. His journey was one of internal conflict: should he conform to or mimic established styles to gain acceptance in the art world he admired, or forge his own unique path? To fully understand The Dream, one must first know Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, France, he was the son of a successful tinsmith and hardware dealer. Rousseau had no formal art training and was a gabelou, or municipal toll service employee, until he was forty. After losing his first wife and eight of his children, he found solace in painting. Unlike his contemporaries, he was a folk painter, dreaming of recognition and acceptance, much like the average members of his class. His late start and competition with other renowned artists added to his struggle. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon noted that while Matisse feared painting tritely, Rousseau longed to create conventional art that would earn him a place among the Artiste Français.",
            "Many a wise mind has pondered the deep link between ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. I firmly believe there's a profound reason for this. As John Keats once wrote in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While much of what we learn in life comes from education or experience, it seems we instinctually grasp ethics and aesthetics without such teachings. Both seek to describe rather than prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty aim to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than laying down rules for judgment or creation. Criticisms of art or morals can never fully capture its essence. Discussions about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for instance, may focus on elements like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but ultimately, these don't explain why it's considered good art. Instead, when discussing favorite works of art or literature, one often hears a phrase like, \"There's just something about it\" before a more complex explanation. I believe both art and morals possess this intangible quality, this \"je ne sais quoi,\" making them transcendent. This connection between ethics and aesthetics is especially evident in literature. As McKean puts it, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality.\" Literature's ability to convey moral values is as integral as it is in life itself. Living inherently involves values, and literature is significant because it reflects these values.",
            "Today's Germany is a powerful, unified country with a rich cultural tapestry weaving from the peaks of the Alps in München to the shores of the Baltic Sea in Kiel. This unique blend of culture is felt throughout Germany, from Köln on the Rhine, through the heart of the country, to the Saxon city of Dresden along the Elbe. Given its rich cultural heritage, it's no surprise that Germany as we know it today is a fusion of various tribes and sources.\n\nGermania, the ancestral home of the Germans, has a debated origin story. Some scholars, like Tacitus, claim the name came from the Germanic tribe known as Tungrians, who were previously called Germans before crossing the Rhine to fight the Gauls. Julius Caesar, in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, used the term “Germanus” to distinguish between conquered Gauls and unconquered Germanic tribes. Others suggest the name might come from the Old English word \"ger,\" meaning spear, or the Old Irish \"garim,\" signifying loud, noisy people.\n\nTacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" wrote that he considered the Germans to be aboriginal and not mixed with other races through immigration or intercourse. He described the harsh conditions of Germania, with its wild landscape, harsh climate, and sullen inhabitants, making it an unlikely destination for those seeking to emigrate.\n\nThe Romans, though they did not initially settle in Germania, sent expeditions to trade with the Germanic tribes and sometimes led military campaigns. However, they mostly returned to their vast empire, leaving the Germanic tribes to live on the empire's borders.\n\nOver time, these tribes began to appear in the middle of the first century, trading goods and skills, including serving in the Roman army.",
            "Below me, I stared, my mind blankly processing the scene before me. Unanimated and silent, I studied the view with practiced detachment, yet refused to connect it to any abstract understanding. Thoughts flowed in and out like a river, leaving me with an almost liquid experience of the moment. I had bought an art instruction book, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,\" to learn how to draw. One technique in the book was to frame a picture within a square, simplifying complex scenes. Looking at the bowl of fruit on the table, I was too overwhelmed to apply this technique. Instead, I just stood there, awestruck. My hand gripped the pencil, muscles tensing and relaxing as I tried to capture the scene. The water was clear and smooth, but the package of brown waste refused to budge, stuck like a slug on the toilet's bottom. With a mop in hand, I frowned at the offending mess. Flushes came and went, as did my introspective moments. Then, I reached for the toilet paper and began wrapping it around my hand like a mummy, creating an oven mitt. Standing up, I slowly dipped my hand into the bowl, as if preparing a turkey for Thanksgiving.",
            "Teenagers are perishing behind the wheel, and several factors are combining to create this deadly trend among young American drivers. The National Institutes of Health highlight that the teen brain is not fully equipped to handle the perils of driving due to its immaturity. Lack of experience is also a significant contributor, leading to more fatal accidents, rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road.\nTeenagers fare worse when accompanied by their peers, a common occurrence as anyone with a modicum of common sense knows. A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center revealed a correlation between the age of passengers and traffic accidents.\nCalifornia and other states have implemented provisional licenses to enhance teen driver safety, restricting driving hours and prohibiting other minors as passengers. However, these are merely temporary fixes. The core issue is that as a collective, young drivers are not adequately prepared to manage the risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman suggests that even 18 is too young for an unrestricted driver's license. USA Today reports that Zuckerman's research indicates a common desire among those under 19-20 to take risks for the thrill. Thus, delaying driving until this tendency abates is sensible. If we persist in licensing young teens to drive, we will continue to witness deadly accidents, and the death toll is likely to escalate in the next few years. By 2010, Baby Boomers' children will be eligible to drive, resulting in millions of new teen drivers hitting the road.\nLegislation addressing this issue would be relatively straightforward. Schools could continue to offer driver’s education classes for future drivers, but no one under 18 could operate a motor vehicle. A provisional permit could precede a full driver’s license, with a specific number of practical driver’s training hours still required, based on the majority of states' current standards (in California, for instance, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult). This legislation would be both reasonable and effective in protecting teens across the nation.\nThe proposed legislation is not a novel idea.",
            "While browsing through the Library of Congress’s collection of early Edison films, I stumbled upon a series of fifteen trick films, created between 1895 and 1901. These films primarily utilize creative editing to create illusions. My study focused on describing the poetics of these trick films, as well as examining the unique features of the later ones. Generally, these trick films of the late 19th century were confined within a frontal proscenium, used no camera movement, and consisted of long and medium shots, adhering to the rule that one shot equaled one film. However, a few films from the early 20th century dared to break these rules by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nOne common aspect among these trick films is their filming within an interior set, framed by a frontal proscenium, with the camera remaining stationary. This was a common technique in early films, drawing inspiration from theater and vaudeville magic acts. Consequently, figures in these trick films typically moved side-to-side within the frame, rarely walking towards or away from the camera. For instance, in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors enter from the right and move back and forth horizontally, with the camera not following them as they exit the frame.\n\nThis frontal proscenium style also resulted in long and medium shots being more common, with close-ups being virtually absent. This method mirrored the theater and vaudeville traditions, where the audience saw the entire performance at once, framed by the stage borders. Actors did not move towards the camera, so close-ups were never used.\n\nMost early trick films followed the rule that one conceptual shot equaled one film, limiting their length to about a minute or less. This also restricted their dramatic or narrative potential, with many focusing on short vaudeville-style tricks like magic and disappearing acts, with minimal story. However, it’s important to note that in a trick film, a single conceptual shot in the viewer's eyes does not correspond to a single physical shot. A single \"shot\" could be composed of multiple joined shots to create illusions. Carefully examine The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), where the physical shot with Mary’s severed \"head\" begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate advocate for Republican ideals. Although he primarily worked as an agriculturalist, his short stint in politics and his dedication to his profession shaped him into a steadfast champion of personal liberty and government. His commitment to agriculture was the cornerstone of his views on sovereignty, the Constitution, and even the judicial system.\n\nJohn Taylor saw the United States as an excellent opportunity to establish an ideal system because there were no native traditions to hinder its creation, allowing for a government of self-rule. He strongly believed in the natural rights of man and their interdependence, arguing that denying any right diminishes the value of all. These rights should remain beyond the government's reach. He viewed the \"state of nature\" as a place where the fittest and most cunning prospered, but in civilization, this should not be the case.\n\nTo create such a society, Taylor believed a government must account for the inherent good and evil within man. He held rigid views on dualistic morality, stating, \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" He defined good principles as those that protect private property, improve agriculture, and discourage capitalism. He believed a government founded on these principles would function fairly regardless of its administration, which would invariably be led by greed and self-interest. Self-interest, he thought, was man's primary motivator, but it was only considered evil when it led to societies that exploited others. A good government was necessary to contain man's natural evil, and even then, it must be closely observed to prevent the introduction of bad principles.\n\nTaylor, like many other staunch Republicans of his time, advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He sought a Federal government with limited rights and powers as explicitly stated in the Constitution. He understood that an extensive Federal government could become expensive and despotic. However, he believed a simple, literal interpretation was dangerous without reference to the writers' intent. He considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, because it more clearly described the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "Referring back to Figure 17, there was a sharp drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. This was a bit disheartening, and it's tricky to pinpoint the exact reason. With the arrival of winter in a New England campus, there's a natural decrease in commuters who travel by bicycle or foot, which could account for part of the decline. December also signals the end of the fall semester, where everyone is busy wrapping up schoolwork and processing grades, possibly causing commuter logs to fall off the radar. Additionally, December ushers in the holiday season, leading to a month-long break for both students and faculty, during which many don't need to come to campus. Classes resume in late January, which aligns with the low number of logs observed. However, the February dip remains unexplained. One might speculate that any new initiative can experience an initial surge of enthusiasm followed by a natural decline. To counteract this, we organized the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a special blitz campaign that boosted log submissions for that month. Thus, maintaining project momentum in the face of both seasonal and semester breaks was a significant challenge. Another hurdle for such projects is that people's love for driving their cars is deeply ingrained in our culture. Therefore, offering incentives to engage in alternative commuting methods is crucial. We distributed numerous prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, an independent bookstore, and even some larger chain stores. It would have been intriguing to see if even more substantial prizes, such as a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car, could have increased participation and engagement. The nature of the prizes didn't change throughout the project. If the prizes had gradually increased in value, it might have helped maintain enthusiasm. Gift cards seemed sufficient at the start, but announcing the addition of a couple of bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January could have potentially increased participation and engagement.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a financial instrument designed to mirror an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets, but trades like a stock. This flexibility makes ETFs attractive, as they offer the benefits of index funds, such as diversification, combined with the advantages of stock ownership, like the ability to short sell or buy on margin. However, ETFs come with their share of drawbacks, including the need to pay commissions on each trade, similar to buying stocks. Additionally, one of the standout features of ETFs is the wide range of funds available. It's essential for smart investors to assess whether these benefits genuinely exist and to what extent. For this analysis, we'll examine the ETF IHF and compare its top 10 holdings to see if owning a single ETF offers comparable benefits to owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks. We'll also explore if there's a better configuration of these stocks that could yield a more optimal Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nTo simplify our evaluation, we'll focus on the top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets. Here are those holdings and their respective percentages:\n\nTo gauge how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we'll calculate their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming the portfolio consists entirely of these ten stocks in the ETF's established proportions. The calculations are presented in the chart below.\n\nFrom the chart, it's clear that a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings yields a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Additionally, the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF's overall Beta. These results suggest that a portfolio of the top 10 holdings could offer a higher return with a lower Beta. However, we must consider if the portfolios' means are statistically different from each other.\n\nTo determine if these portfolios differ significantly, we'll calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalize it to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation with that of the ETF IHF.",
            "\"Dream-land\" is one of Edgar Allan Poe's self-claimed superior poems. In this work, Poe employs the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, which Mabbott links back to Virgil. Virgil used this term to refer to an island north of Britain, considered the edge of the known world by the Greeks. Although Virgil indeed utilized this term, some credit should be given to a more contemporary source, as Poe was particularly interested in German authors. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" highlights the similarities between their poems, concluding that Poe was emulating Goethe.\n\nOxford Companion to English Literature notes that Goethe was a notable writer, famous for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts— the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe's death. Within the second part of \"Faust,\" there is a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem recounts the tale of a king who loses his wife after she gives him a goblet as a gift. Driven to grief and despair, he drinks heavily and eventually decides to end his life, leaving the goblet to the sea. The character of the King of Thule and the description of the narrator in \"Dream-Land\" share striking similarities, possibly serving as a dark mirror to Poe's own grief and struggle with alcohol.\n\nPoe references \"Thule\" twice in his writings. In \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" he uses the phrase \"ultra Thule,\" and in \"Dream-Land,\" he employs the term twice, framing the poem. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes the landscape of Thule as dark, lonely, and haunted by deceased friends, with a world devoid of color. These scenes echo the themes in \"The King of Thule,\" where the king is consumed by grief, loneliness, and a loss of will to live. The poem reads as if the speaker has stepped into Goethe's narrative.\n\nGoethe was a notable author whom Poe would have known, even if only peripherally through his respect for Tennyson. Poe himself acknowledged his admiration for Tennyson when asked. Beyond his connection to Tennyson, Poe would have been exposed to Goethe's work through various reproductions and translations, given the widespread popularity of his works after the original publications.",
            "Could a customer who suffered injuries from slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages if the store manager knew about the spill twice and didn't clean it for half an hour because he was having dinner? A judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer's punitive damage claim. To win, Palmer must prove that Martin's actions were malicious, meaning he acted with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm. She can argue that Martin should have cleaned the spill, as multiple customers had been injured from slipping before Palmer's accident, despite knowing the risks. While Martin's actions might seem despicable, they are reasonable given the six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009. On October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee named Rich Wayne told Martin about the spill, but Martin was on his dinner break. At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, informed Martin again, and he still didn't clean it. At 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and fell, sustaining a serious back injury. Palmer is suing D&D for damages, and we're considering a partial summary against the punitive damage claim. In California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for breach of non-contractual obligations if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud, or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct intending harm or, absent intent, conduct that's despicable and committed with a willful disregard of others' rights or safety. Courts have ruled conduct malicious when the defendant was aware of the probable dangers and deliberately failed to avoid them. Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "Almost four years ago, I delved into a course on Islam at CBC. The class sparked passionate debates about whether Islam is inherently hostile. This question feels increasingly pertinent today. Reflecting on the 9/11 aftermath, I've seen a shift in American mass media's perception of Islam and extremists, from hostility to an extreme form of tolerance. I doubt that in 2001, a presidential candidate named Barack Obama, with a clear Muslim background, could have been plausible.\n\nThe Prophet's Biography, I find, is intriguing yet puzzling. According to historical accounts, Muhammad's life seems to contradict his portrayal in the biography. Past knowledge suggests he forced tribes to convert to Islam through conquest, but the biography depicts him as a misunderstood martyr, humbled by others until they saw the truth in his teachings.\n\nStriking similarities between Jesus' ministries and Muhammad's 'miracles' catch my attention. The instance of multiplying mutton and milk for forty men is notable. This narrative style, I believe, aims to present Muhammad as a humble prophet, relying on truth and miracles rather than proving himself. Such attributions diminish Jesus' life and personhood, as if Muhammad is stealing his glory.\n\nMoreover, many stories in the biography seem to serve as proof of 'witnesses' converting to Islam independently. However, many accounts are relayed thirdhand, diluting their credibility. These stories are less persuasive because they're not firsthand and appear more suspicious.\n\nWhat bothers me most is attempting to elevate Muhammad to a godly, humble, wise, and gentle figure. History contradicts this portrayal, suggesting that Muhammad's rise to power was less gentle and more complex.",
            "The teachings and beliefs that Jesus held during his life were quickly abandoned as Christian thought evolved after his death. When observed in broader terms, Christianity progressively distanced itself from its origins. Today, the world is witnessing a growing awareness and unprecedented forward-moving trend. While traditionalists persist and resist new ideas, they may not have enough influence to alter the collective. Among Christians, historical understanding will significantly increase in years to come. A desire will arise to differentiate added doctrines from Christianity’s core principles. This process may take generations or centuries, but the reversal of Christian history is inevitable. A movement will emerge, stripping away layers of doctrine, akin to rewinding time, until only Jesus' original teachings remain. When this trend permeates the United States and Europe, masses will worship as if living during Jesus' time, adhering solely to his ideas. The church, as an institution, will maintain strength, leading the way. However, theological uniformity will increase, reducing diversity. Between regions, denominations, and divisions, similarities will outweigh differences. History is filled with reversals; Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire, which later became a Christian state. Similarly, our country shifted from African-American slavery to leadership. The upcoming reversal in Christianity will undo history and diversity. This process will be facilitated by interpreting Jesus' words metaphorically, not literally. What has transpired since Jesus' lifetime?\n\nLooking back in history, we find only Judaism, the foundation for Christianity. Monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were central to the religion by the time Rome controlled Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population was divided: Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the majority of common people.",
            "The novel \"The Jungle\" by Upton Sinclair serves as a stark illustration of the inherent greed and self-interest of people. It highlights how individuals prioritize their own prosperity at the expense of others, never considering those less fortunate. Sinclair effectively portrays this through the factory owners and managers who strive for nothing but the expansion of their businesses, disregarding any obstacles or collateral damage. The text paints a vivid image of the detrimental effects of industrialization, as \"the line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". This smog and pollution, along with animal waste runoff, are indicative of the owners' apathy towards human and environmental well-being. The same callous disregard is evident in their treatment of employees, who are exploited for maximum profit, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". Workers are subjected to harsh conditions, lengthy hours, and sudden layoffs, all without any compensation or job assistance. The absence of protective laws or regulations allowed such mistreatment to flourish. The workers, laboring and living in such deplorable conditions, were effectively treated as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Many writers employ various tactics to evoke specific feelings or perspectives in their readers regarding pivotal subjects. F. Scott Fitzgerald deploys several of these techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. He oftentimes pairs adjectives with nouns that don't typically align to create a particular atmosphere. Additionally, Fitzgerald imbues symbols with meaning and reuses them for the same purpose. He employs this strategy with numerous colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald establishes significance for these colors, particularly white/gray, which he later uses to convey certain feelings about important elements.\n\n[REWRITE]Fitzgerald's description of white/gray as uniformity, with white representing a touch of elegance and high society and gray signifying age and weariness, is evident from the beginning of the book. Daisy and Jordan are frequently referred to as \"in white\" (8), and everyone at Gatsby's party wears white, such as Nick in \"white flannels\" (41), Tom in a \"white shirt\" (36), and Catherine as \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only exceptions are when Nick observes Gatsby's party: \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further underscores this by coloring mundane subjects with these colors: Nick goes \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the names on Nick's timetable are \"gray names\" (61), and Catherine's apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\" (28). Simple or ordinary people and places are also described in white or gray: Daisy and Jordan shared a \"white girlhood\" (19), the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"gray\" Italian child (26), and the dog-seller as a \"gray old man\" (27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has established the meaning of white/gray, he utilizes these colors to signify unimportance or uniformity around certain subjects. This first applies to Daisy. After a prolonged absence of any notable usage of these colors, Fitzgerald portrays Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster\"; readers start to perceive Daisy as less of a character and more like a uniform addition, an object of Gatsby's longing (74). Fitzgerald employs this technique repeatedly around Daisy to reinforce this uniformity, such as the \"gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar\" (18) and her \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County is a hotbed of agricultural activity, thanks to its mild, sunny climate. Crops grown here include tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There's a robust market for organic community-supported agriculture in the area, with many local organizations having long waiting lists for organic eggs and milk. Organic farms often offer tours and recreational activities like hiking and birdwatching. This type of operation can both benefit from government programs and improve habitat quality, allowing for farm tours and educational programs.   While organic farming has higher costs and lower efficiency than conventional farming, it promotes greater plant and wildlife biodiversity in the area due to the absence of chemicals. Additional efforts to benefit wildlife, such as planting cover crops and managing plant growth, may also incur higher labor costs. Therefore, a landowner in this scenario might seek financial help to maximize profits and habitat quality.   The land in question is a 160-acre parcel near the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It's a mix of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. This area is part of the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion and is home to over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered or declining. The land was once inhabited by Native Americans and later used for cattle grazing and wood production.   To explore viable options for a small farmer, I chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs for cost mitigation and wildlife preservation. As a model, I found an organic farm in the same area.",
            "Culture plays a crucial role in any negotiation. It's not simply about what a culture is, but also what it isn't and what it signifies. Culture is diverse, not singular or uniform. Generalizations like “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating” are overly broad. Instead of focusing on broad stereotypes, it's more beneficial to understand the relevance of a culture to the negotiation at hand and how it influences these conversations. Approaching a foreign culture means we relate it to our own and make comparisons. Understanding a culture often involves exploring its history and recognizing its prejudices. Rather than passing judgment or trying to change it, one must accept it and operate within its boundaries, especially when negotiations are weak. If a negotiator finds themselves in a foreign environment, respect for traditions and beliefs can help overcome cultural barriers and progress the negotiation.\n\nCulture isn't limited to national differences. Even within a single nation, companies can develop their own unique corporate culture, which can vary widely. For example, some cultures may stress long office hours, while others promote a more relaxed schedule. Corporate culture can be seen in dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. Some companies encourage general employee philanthropy, while others limit it to “approved” causes. Even within American culture, there's significant diversity from company to company and region to region. While some cultures may appear uniform to outsiders, they often hide deeper complexities. Understanding the values of a culture is crucial, as they provide the reasons behind its behavior. If a culture values “saving face” or communal harmony, a negotiator won't publicly shame their company or superior to win. Conversely, a negotiator from a culture that prioritizes aggressive bargains won't rush to settle. Considering these cultural nuances beforehand is essential, but also learning about the personal background of the opposing negotiator can make the negotiation more effective.",
            "\"An arrogant fool has declared, 'There is no God.' This sentiment is first found in the Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and forms the basis for St. Anselm's argument on God's existence. Similarly, St. Thomas Aquinas holds this belief. Given that we must compare their arguments defending this concept, we assume they both correctly believe in the Bible's God. To fairly compare their arguments, we must consider the specific God they each describe. Both authors argue for the existence of God, but neither fully establishes a comprehensive foundation for belief.\n\nStarting with St. Anselm's argument, it proposes that understanding God lies within our own minds. He suggests that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot conceptualize his nonexistence. While this reasoning is complex and sometimes unclear, it essentially states that the proof for God is found within our own minds. We don't need external evidence; we only need to examine our inherent knowledge. This idea is called faith in Christian texts.\n\nConversely, St. Thomas Aquinas argues that God's existence can be proven through reason and empirical evidence, without the need for faith. This approach aids evangelism, as it allows for logical persuasion rather than reliance on faith. Aquinas presents five logical arguments supporting God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument shows that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for his existence. If you know all but one piece of a puzzle, you can deduce the missing piece's characteristics and existence without seeing it.",
            "Back in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would later be known as Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he renounced worldly attachments and achieved enlightenment, which led to the establishment of Buddhism—Theravada Buddhism being the most traditional sect. Over the course of twenty-five hundred years, the religion has evolved from its original teachings. This evolution is evident in Theravada countries like Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is celebrated. Monks and laypeople both participate in this ritual, despite Buddha never having taught about such celebrations. Changes in the religion range from superficial traditions to core beliefs and practices. Both the monastic and lay communities have had to adapt their doctrinal principles over time, influenced by both positive and negative external and internal factors.\n\nI'll be using some specific terms in this discussion. Internal forces refer to influences from within the Buddhist community, regardless of monastic status, while external forces are from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that seek to harm the Buddhist community based on negative perceptions of Buddhism. Benign forces, on the other hand, do not intend to harm or help the community but may have such effects as a byproduct.\n\nTo understand Theravada Buddhism, let's start with its core beliefs and doctrines. Buddhists find refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma consists of the Tripitaka—three baskets—of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka explores the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism, like Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these concepts allows one to end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth. When one achieves enlightenment, lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) also cease. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for living, including five precepts for laypeople (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances) and many more for monks. The most fundamental doctrine is the four noble truths: life is suffering (Dukkha), attachment causes suffering, suffering can be overcome, and there is a path to end suffering.",
            "From 1836 to 1893, the United States and Mexico were locked in a long-standing rivalry, lasting 57 years. The peak of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848, where the U.S. took Texas and the American Southwest from Mexico. Beyond this major conflict, numerous other skirmishes occurred between these two nations, finally simmering down before the First World War. The tension started due to disagreements over religion, culture, and key material interests (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis is not unique to just the U.S. and Mexico. Nations sharing borders often have conflicts over interests, which can lead to rivalries. David M. Pletcher (1977) pointed out that only Mexico and Cuba have such enduring problems with the U.S. (p. 41). These two nations are geographically close and have historically been rivals, unlike many other Latin American countries that have maintained good relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences were a substantial issue, mirroring historic divisions. Sally Frahm (2001) noted that in the 18th and 19th centuries, Americans opposed Catholicism and monarchy, similar to the Cold War's ideological struggles between the U.S. and the Soviet Union (p. 86). The distrust between the English and Spanish, inherited from colonial times, was a significant barrier to friendly foreign relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) identified 17 disputes during this 57-year period, most of which were territorial issues involving border raids and frontier problems. Bandit attacks from American towns were a prevalent problem that continued until both nations exerted military control on their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).\n\nThe rivalry's end is attributed to Mexico's growing dependence on the U.S. (Schmitt 1974, p. 109) and the U.S.'s shift from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico in the late 19th century (p. 110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, I found myself unexpectedly disabled by an illness that I had never known existed. At the time, I was a nurse, a job I chose out of a deep-seated need for security and stability, something I had lacked as a child. \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick\" was the mantra that echoed through my adolescence. Even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist, preferably a bit of both, I chose nursing. However, here I was, 46 years old, single, and unable to work after being stricken by an illness. After years of living on Social Security Disability, I have little left to call my own. Each day is a struggle, an assault on my security, safety, and self-esteem. Everything in my life is uncertain, yet there is one truth I know to be absolute: I could not have endured these years without the help of my family and a few good friends. And believe me, when disaster strikes, you don't feel strong. My point is that emergencies will always arise, both big and small. No matter how well you prepare, some things are too big to overcome alone. I agree that we in the U.S. should not rely solely on big government, as it is crumbling. Instead, I believe we should learn to trust and help each other. The Conservatives in the U.S. talk about \"rugged individualism\" that built this country, but what truly kept our forefathers going in hard times was compassion, mutual respect, and sharing resources. Pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. So, by all means, be prepared. I am ready. I have a disaster kit, first aid supplies, water purifying tablets, plastic sheeting, duct tape for the windows in case of a biological attack, and plenty of flashlights, batteries, candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have the land and resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food, do it. It's a great idea, as is a wood stove, as long as you don't live in an apartment. But while you're at it, get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms change the way they do? Are there limits or bounds that shape the path of evolutionary changes? Even today, the notion that we can describe living forms mathematically remains a distant dream. Yet, recent advancements have seen mathematical modeling applied to various aspects of mollusk shell formation, both in their development and evolution. Our research aims to combine mathematical modeling of Prunum's developmental and evolutionary changes with experimental studies to understand how these changes occur and how they scale. We analyzed X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative traits that can simulate shell morphologies. These data were fed into the software program CerioShell. We created hypothetical shell shapes to interpret potential morphological changes in Prunum. Our results are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to better grasp macroevolutionary events in this group. Shells can be visualized as tubes that wrap around an imaginary axis, or columella, through 360 degrees of space. These loops, called whorls, expand at varying speeds. The largest whorl is the body whorl, and the spire consists of all other whorls. The aperture is the opening through which the animal extends. Shells can be examined from different angles: apical (looking from the top), basal (from the bottom), apertural (the usual way, with the aperture facing upward), and abapertural. To count whorls, first view the shell from the apical side, locate the first suture, draw a line, and count whorls from this point. Each whorl can be estimated to a quarter of a whorl. Imagine the shell as a series of apertures moving through time and space as the animal constructs its shell. The trajectory of the aperture can be represented mathematically, and once formulated, parameters can be adjusted to modify the mollusk's shell formation.",
            "For the past decade, Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have remained largely unchanged. While the country is making strides towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation, improvements in child and maternal health are significantly lagging behind the required progress to meet the 2015 targets. The reasons for this stagnation are complex, pointing to the need to bolster the overall health system rather than focusing solely on specific programmatic interventions.\n\nIndonesia has seen an increase in births attended by skilled healthcare workers, with 72% of births now meeting this benchmark. However, this figure includes traditional workers like midwives who lack the capacity to handle complicated pregnancies, thus contributing to high maternal mortality rates. The progress in this area is somewhat deceptive as it still falls short of comprehensive improvement. Additionally, there has been a drop in the percentage of diarrhea cases among children under five years old that are treated by healthcare professionals. Postnatal care data is incomplete, indicating a substantial concern in this area with low rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain low, at around 4%, which is a cause for concern. The rate is 7% in urban areas compared to just 2% in rural settings, highlighting the issue of inequity in service coverage. Clearly, healthcare services are centralized in urban areas. Another major concern is vertical equity, with a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, indicating that the poor face significant barriers to accessing healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nIn contemplating the next steps to enhance neonatal and maternal health indicators, the fundamental question is how to best address the lack of services. Should Indonesia adopt program-specific approaches or focus on strengthening the entire health system without singling out pre and post-pregnancy care for mothers and infants? Programmatic approaches, with their targeted and manageable objectives, often yield quicker results. However, there are drawbacks to consider. Heavily investing in one area may divert funding and resources from others, as has been seen with international funding for HIV/AIDS impacting the family planning sector. Moreover, running multiple parallel programs can lead to duplicated services and uncoordinated efforts, resulting in increased paperwork and administrative burdens.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their meticulous detail and focus on the aristocracy of the era. Two notable exceptions are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, which incorporate elements of mystery and the bizarre, deviating from the typical Victorian narrative. These elements enhance the characters, providing insight into their motivations and emotions. The peculiar happenings in these novels often take the form of dream sequences or dreamlike states, revealing various aspects of the characters' inner lives.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, these dreamlike sequences frequently unveil Oliver's inner turmoil, the pain he experiences, and his awareness of the true nature of his surroundings. For instance, when Oliver relives the shooting in chapter 28, he is overwhelmed by the event as if he were in a dream. This vivid recollection underscores his lack of control over the events and his desperate straits. The constant pain and fear he experiences highlight his helplessness and the sense of defeat that is beginning to take hold of him. It seems as if Fagin's influence has broken him, rendering him unable to react or even attempt to control the events unfolding around him. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over his circumstances, with the question of whose will brought about his misfortune lingering ominously in the air. The passage also suggests that Oliver is losing his ability to react, as his life's events overwhelm him.\n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” (Dickens, 220)\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in its fleeting ours.”",
            "A few years back, I worked at an after-school program offering tutoring to elementary-aged students. I focused on helping them with subjects they were struggling in, with my strength being in English and reading. One of the instructors asked me to assist a boy named Adrian, who was having difficulty reading. It didn't take long for me to realize that something was amiss; he pronounced some letters correctly while others he butchered, which was quite odd. Adrian was of Latino descent and spoke excellent English, but he had a peculiar problem with understanding the English alphabet. I was his babysitter one day when his mom walked in. She only spoke Spanish, and my Spanish was limited, but we managed to communicate. I realized then that Adrian could read but didn't know the English alphabet well. I hope my discovery helped him, as I'm not sure it did. I share this to highlight the issue of language barriers in schools, especially here in California. It’s not as obvious as one might think. Even a child speaking perfect English can struggle with reading. I believe everyone agrees this problem exists, so what's the solution? For Adrian, it was English reading tutoring for the alphabet and pronunciations. For many children who barely speak English, the solution is complex. No single approach works. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes – none of these, alone, will fix the problem. The key is combining them all.",
            "From the moment we're young, we're told about something out there that's bigger than us, beyond our understanding. Some of us learn about it at Sunday school, others at Temple, or through our own introspective journeys. Many accept the faith passed down by their parents, while others reject it, believing only in their own egocentric universe. No matter our path, we seek to define ourselves through our unique perspectives on spirituality, searching for a light to guide us through the darkness.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said when I asked him his favorite type of bird. We sat on the porch, the rain drumming on the tin roof overhead as we smoked. The gutters carried the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge. He looked out into the rain, his gaze both searching and remembering. He'd grown thin, his clothes hanging loosely, his hair sparse. He avoided eye contact, and I felt alone, afraid, unable to talk about how much I'd miss him. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair closer, and joined him in watching the rain fall on the June twilight.\n\nMy father passed in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation had prolonged his suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors' predictions. I couldn't watch him pass, so I didn't. I wanted to remember him by how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew him better than anyone, and I knew Dad wouldn't want his only child to witness his death. So, I curled up in my bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "The classic \"Gothic Novel\" is essentially a blend of \"Old\" and \"New\" traditions, as Ian Watt points out in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic genre has been both criticized and celebrated, accused of lacking depth and praised for its capacity to evoke a sense of the 'terrible sublime' (Burke). The foundation of the Gothic genre was laid by Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, which combined elements from both \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances to create a new literary style. Walpole utilized \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre draws heavily from medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even when The Castle of Otranto was published, the term \"gothic\" was used to describe various peoples, styles, and time periods, often seen as archaic or unsophisticated compared to \"modern\" societal and literary advancements. The fusion of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" elements and the new format of the novel (allowing readers a more intimate look into the psychology of characters) is what has kept the Gothic genre relevant and fresh for readers, even centuries removed from its original creation.",
            "Supply chain management is the series of steps involved in moving products from customer orders through raw materials, production, and distribution to the final customer. The term was coined in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. He described it as the process of planning, implementing, and controlling the supply chain to meet customer needs efficiently. The main components of a supply chain are: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these components to ensure optimal customer service. Production is the first step in this process, serving as the foundation. It involves deciding on the 'when', 'why', 'where', and 'how' of production. Managers must understand customer demands, which can be gauged through market analysis. Once the market is understood, managers determine what products to produce and in what quantities. The next step is choosing the optimal location for production based on volume, quality, and cost. After that, managers focus on scheduling and equipment maintenance. Production is crucial for the supply chain, with every detail being vital to avoid delays and costs. For instance, I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target, where there were detailed processes for every task, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments. This structure ensures smooth operations and clear direction for employees. The second key element is supply, which involves strategic decisions about core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. A company may have multiple divisions for a single product, each with its own equipment and specialists. Managers must determine which division is best for each process. Outsourcing can be used to improve velocity, which refers to providing quality and flexibility while reducing costs.",
            "Adolf Hitler is alive in Burma, the sign reads.\n\nEllen Page, renowned for her role in Juno, stands alone on a street corner, a cardboard sign held above her head. The message, scrawled in Sharpie, is about the current state of Burma, also known as Myanmar. A Southeast Asian country ruled by a repressive military junta that came to power in 1962 through a coup d’état. In 2007, peacefully protesting monks sparked the \"Saffron Revolution,\" named for their robes. Initially, the government allowed the monks to gather, but the protests escalated into a war between the monks and the military, who invaded monasteries. Foreign journalists were imprisoned or killed, with Kenji Nagai, a Japanese photojournalist, killed on September 27th, 2007. The official death toll is 13, but Colonel Hla Win, a defector, claims it's in the thousands.\n\nThis isn't new. History is filled with examples of governments suppressing dissent and maintaining complete control. Early Roman emperors claimed divine right to rule. Japanese emperors are believed to be gods, and our current President Bush has weekly calls with Ted Haggard, leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary of the Republican Party.\n\nFamous examples abound. The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests saw intellectuals, labor activists, and students killed. The death toll ranges from 200 to 3,000. The Rwandan genocide in the 90s saw Hutu militia, aided by the government, kill Tutsis and political moderates. Hitler's Third Reich, with its systematic killing of Jews, is another stark example.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring impact on jazz is largely due to his longevity and, by extension, his skill in shaping his orchestra. Ellington's piano presence is often subtle in many compositions, but as a composer, he excelled at crafting rich, intricate pieces that showcased the individual talents of his band members. He created a framework that allowed soloists to improvise freely, while also writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that highlighted each musician's unique style. This approach emphasized the overall tone of the orchestra, creating original and coherent sounds for each piece. Ellington's ability to master the individual players' sounds and how they fit together in a growing group enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's sound and innovation, mentioning Creole Love Call as an early example of his use of voice as a jazz instrument. This piece demonstrates his ability to add texture and color to a piece without lyrics, and also shows how he complemented his soloists' styles throughout his career. Creole Love Call, a slow, deliberate 12-bar blues piece with six choruses, features:\n- Chorus 1: A call and response between voice and reeds, starting smooth and melodic, transitioning to a rougher sound.\n- Chorus 2: A muted trumpet solo by the reeds, elaborating on the basic melody with extended blue notes.\n- Chorus 3: A sweeping clarinet solo in the high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\n- Chorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by brass and reed sections.\n- Chorus 5: The climactic chorus, where reeds initiate the call and response in the high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\n- Chorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with a \"growl\" solo by the voice.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add tone color in this piece is just one example of a stylistic trait that runs throughout his work. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing uses Miley's vocal elements and Cox's instrumental voice to create a rich, complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) further extends these ideas, with Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a key member of Ellington's orchestra, introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "She had always felt an emptiness inside, a yearning for something that wouldn't be filled. It began at 14, when she was discovering her teenage life, and it stayed with her at 17. She had decided she wanted a person, not an object, yet no one appealed to her. Boys would sometimes be attracted to her, but she felt no interest. She often questioned this, trying to figure out what could cause such a sensation in a teenage girl. Years of contemplation brought several theories, but nothing solid enough to speculate on. So she lived her life, continually puzzling over her desires.\n\nA quiet day at home was usually peaceful. Her parents were calm and never argued, and arguments with her were rare. They'd only disagree about her asserting her independence and lively personality. She was quite likeable, even with her parents, due to her energetic and kind nature.\n\nToday, though, was not peaceful. As she wandered from room to room seeking inspiration, she heard a sudden scream from the kitchen, her mother's voice. She rushed in, panicking, \"Mom?! What's wrong?!\" She saw her mother on the floor, moaning \"Ow,\" in short breaths. Her daughter rushed to her side and placed a hand on her to help. \"Ouch ... sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital.\" The words were rushed and strained, and her daughter understood her immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I should pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands, and at that moment, the hero of the house was grateful for her strength. She carried her mother to the car, laid her down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought the harsh scent of disinfectant and sickness, but she didn't sense that, as her mind was consumed with helping her mother. She rushed her to the doctors and they quickly moved her to a rolling bed to be examined. Her daughter sat worriedly, waiting.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a step stool while trying to reach a vase from the highest cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that sticking to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as indicated by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is linked to a reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke mortality. The aMed diet is a modified Med diet, characterized by higher consumption of plant foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, monounsaturated fats compared to saturated fats, and fish, with lower intake of animal products and saturated fats. It also allows for moderate alcohol consumption.\n\nPrevious studies showed that adhering to the Med diet was associated with a lower risk of total and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, and an intervention trial found it more effective than a low-fat diet for weight loss and cholesterol ratio reduction in obese individuals. However, these studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study followed 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without a history of CVD or diabetes from the Nurses' Health Study, involving 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. They assessed an aMed diet score using six self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (FFQs) between 1984 and 2004 to evaluate nutrient intake over the preceding year. Over 95% of nurses maintained participation throughout the 20-year period. FFQs underwent validation, and reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed via medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. Where records were unavailable, cases were classed as “probable” (around 17% of strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts). The study adjusted for factors like body mass index, smoking, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, alcohol intake, and physical activity.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to examine the link between an aMed score and CHD and stroke risk, separately considering fatal and nonfatal types. Greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was linked to a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, they found 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths. Women in the top aMed quintile had a lower risk of both CHD and stroke than those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In 2007, the United States of America was hit by a severe financial crisis. Unemployment surged, the housing market imploded, and many of the nation's largest and most significant corporations were left shattered. This recession continues to this day, so we must ponder the following: how did this crisis occur, and how can we prevent it from happening again? In short, the financial crisis was sparked by self-serving and ignorant political decisions that coerced banks and firms to issue sub-prime loans into an insecure and inadequate financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwrite and repack these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks lacked sufficient capital reserves and passed on the chaos to the repacked mortgages they had sold, and subsequently, to the broader economy.\n\nThe financial crisis’s seeds were sown in 1999 during the Clinton era, as the President sought a second term by boosting his popularity. To achieve this, the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, paving the way for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's largest mortgage underwriter, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate-income people and felt pressure from shareholders to maintain its remarkable growth in profits.” Holmes accurately predicted the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As mentioned earlier, and as Holmes foresaw, imprudent lending would indeed lead to the economy’s collapse.\n\nSeveral factors combined to plunge the economy into chaos, one of which was the novel and intricate structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were extensively used in the years preceding the crisis, further entangling more sectors of the economy in the housing market. This led to U.S. households and financial markets generally becoming excessively exposed to the housing market, making them extremely susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had purchased these mortgage-backed securities were left in ruins. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion dollars in mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a significant discount, Lehman Brothers was dissolved, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were compelled to become commercial banks under intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie held $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. It's that section of your story where you either take flight and astound your readers or send them to sleep and make them hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name. Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her screen when she stumbles into Too Much Information, not even in the fun way. Exposition isn't your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still finds herself in long passages where nothing happens, or worse, too much. Exposition is the little devil on your shoulder whispering to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil urging you to tell every detail of each character's childhood).\n\nExposition means telling your audience what happened, typically in simple prose. In film, it's when one character tells another a core-dump of information, like \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order. As you're reading a story, you're told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to take two pages, with both he and she only getting two lines of dialogue each. You'd expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, showing through his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you'd expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case). A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on. You'd mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you'd expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat. Sometimes it's tempting to rush past certain things. Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and",
            "I caught two broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first, aired live by NBC 4 today (August 13, 2011), reported a man named Shad Hostettler had stabbed his wife in Ashley, Ohio. Her name wasn't mentioned, but they showed his mug shot—he looked downright sinister. They devoted about two minutes to this story, which I believe was appropriate given its ongoing nature. The second story was about an early morning shooting in the Sharon Woods area, critically injuring 18-year-old Travis Buyers. No arrests had been made, and the SWAT team was investigating. This story seemed brief, and I suspect it might have been due to the fact it involved a minority neighborhood. Over the years, I've noticed minorities often receive scant media coverage when they're crime victims. Conversely, if a white child or adult is involved, the media goes into overdrive. Another story focused on a bullet hole in a Med-Flight helicopter, which was determined to be from a .22 caliber rifle shot. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest. Next up was a weather forecast for Saturday's afternoon thunderstorms, with temperatures expected to stay mid- to low-eighties over the weekend. A brief story followed about a Clime Road UDF robbery by a dark-skinned, six-foot tall, 150-pound suspect wearing a hoodie. I found it odd they emphasized his skin color so much. Lastly, a story about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin, was reported. He was sentenced to 300 months (25 years) for conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana to Ohio from Texas. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, which I believed was unnecessary to the story.",
            "There's a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lies a mix of emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers understand each other more than anyone else can, and when they look at their brother, they see a reflection of themselves. This bond is tested during dire situations, revealing the good or evil within. These emotions come with a cost, affecting how we interpret our own actions and their consequences. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers explore this theme and its intense emotions. They journey through a vivid landscape, but bitterness and pride collide in the climax, and only one brother survives. The story is told through Doodle's characterization and his interactions with his older brother, as well as the narrator's perspective, highlighting Doodle's complex feelings and his view of the world, which greatly influence his actions.\n\nDoodle's actions are driven by his pride. From their first outing together to their final, fateful adventure, Doodle feels resentment towards his younger brother. He wanted someone to teach his worldly skills to, like holding his breath, running, jumping, or climbing vines in Old Woman Swamp. He wanted a brother to race to Horsehead Landing and perch with him in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn. However, Doodle was born with a weak heart, making it nearly impossible for him to participate in vigorous activities. This crushes the young protagonist's dreams and even triggers thoughts of infanticide, showing a moment of dark realization. Yet, when Doodle smiles at him, the young protagonist's heart melts, revealing an underlying love.",
            "The human brain is quite an intricate and imaginative information-processing system. As technology has evolved from primitive to modern, so have the ways we describe the brain. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, a book, and most recently, a computer. Remember that while these metaphors can be helpful, they also have their limitations and can lead to misconceptions. Information processing begins with data from the sensory organs, which turn physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, or light particles into electrochemical signals. The brain then continually processes this data in both a bottom-up and top-down manner. For instance, when looking at an image of a black box on a white background, the brain combines simple bits of information like color, orientation, and where the edges are to recognize it as a box. Meanwhile, top-down processing can speed up this recognition by using previous decisions to identify it as a black box rather than a hole. Once information is processed, an attention filter determines its importance and directs it to relevant cognitive processes. For example, while walking through a field of grass, you won't notice each blade individually because of a healthy attention filter. However, your brain can pick out your name even in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and attention continually modulates the results. To process information, the brain must first store it. There are different types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. Information is encoded based on its type, such as structurally for written words, phonemically for spoken words, or semantically for their meanings. Working memory, lasting around 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through specific neurons, while long-term memory is thought to be held in certain protein structures. The way knowledge is organized in the brain varies among models, such as those based on human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that concepts are represented by nodes, linked based on their relatedness. For example, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley critiques the impending peril of both technology and the capitalist system that upholds it through the dystopian society depicted in Brave New World. The populace prioritizes collective well-being over individuality and is programmed from birth to seek immediate gratification. The citizens are revealed as pawns in a grand scheme orchestrated by the World Controller, their actions dictated by a single ideology. Analyzing the text through a Marxist lens, one discerns Huxley's mistrust of the developing economic landscape of his era. Key Marxist terms like homogeny and reification underscore the novel's commentary on the flaws in the rising economy. Capitalism is mocked through the concept of false consciousness, where the common people are kept ignorant of their true economic relations, fixated on their own interests. This result is due to the ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, evident through the conditioning of Brave New World's citizens. The lower classes, Delta, Gamma, et al., lack true autonomy; hypnopædia reinforces a drive to consume and indulge, manipulated by the World Controller. Hegemony, where social classes are dominated by a ruling few, is clearly present. The common classes, unaware of their manipulation, 'buy into an ideology that supports the structure' (i.e. capitalism and consumerism). Upper classes, while aware, accept their place, with few exceptions like Bernard. The interactions between social classes, explored in greater detail, reflect the perceived oppression of capitalism. Relationships between individuals do not exist in Brave New World. Characters lack depth, even among major figures, suggesting technology and capitalism strip man of free will and expression. Emotions are kept superficial, as evidenced by male remarks on women's physical appearance and women's casual talk about their encounters. Societal classes' complacency with their hierarchical status reveals the socioeconomic impact of capitalism. Their absolute conformity to their communal roles mirrors Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely empowered by their consumption and obedience to their peers.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for nearly three years now, or roughly four and a half semesters. Like many others, I've found navigating the campus a bit of a hassle. Freshman year, I was assigned to an East Halls dorm, practically the farthest point from the rest of the campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traversing from my home in Stuart Hall to classes like those in the Willard building, situated right in the heart of campus, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially in the often harsh weather conditions of State College. Upon speaking with an alum not much older than myself, I discovered that not too long ago, the East Halls dorms were isolated from the main campus by expansive tracts of unused land. Today, those empty spaces have been transformed into sports fields, new buildings such as the Creamery and the health services center, and are now surrounded by apartments. As our campus continues to grow, getting from one place to another becomes increasingly challenging. What's the best solution to this problem? On a college campus, it's the bicycle. However, bikes alone won't solve the issue; students need to use them, and the campus must be designed with biking in mind.\n\nRecently, I chatted with a friend who had taken up cycling again after a few years. He mentioned that he couldn't believe he ever stopped. “Bikes are fantastic,” he said, “they were uncool for a while, but they're the only way to get around.” Apart from being great for your health, bicycling is the most efficient means of travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a bit of exercise can take you 30 miles or more. Now that I live off campus, as far from the center as some dorms, the wisest decision I made this year was to purchase a bike. My daily class in Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from my home, can be reduced to 5 minutes if I pedal quickly. The only downside is that the most direct route to Thomas, Pollock Road, isn't always the easiest path to cycle on. While walking has its merits, I simply don't have the time to walk. Without my bike, walking would be my only reliable way to get to class. This would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my daily commute, totaling over two and a half hours each week. Add to that the time I'd need to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and other commitments, and that's more time than I can spare."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "In aspiring for a career in social work, I aim to join the Division of Family and Children Services to assist kids who've faced abuse or neglect; I also want to support troubled families. My contributions to the social work field would include: service, respect, ethical standing, and a dedication to fostering better relationships and continuously improving my own professional skills. These principles aren't just key for social workers; they are personal values for me.\n\nI've always yearned to help others, yet I was uncertain of the right career path. Throughout high school and college, I witnessed folks shying away from problems in denial and using ineffective coping methods. These situations inspired me to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still uncertain of a career path, I took a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. One summer day, a friend introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy visiting her, nervous and seeking refuge from his abusive parents. The next day, I learned he'd called the police. To offer help, I visited his parents' residence. I privately shared my concerns with the police, who then asked me to speak with the parents since legal options were limited. The parents seemed anxious and claimed their son was ‘manipulative.’ This experience sparked my serious consideration of a social work career to assist families dealing with ‘simple’ disputes.\n\nA crucial value for social work is social justice. Our society proclaims the importance of the individual yet often follows archaic traditions rather than true uniqueness. If we mourn lost individuals, why strive to be like ‘everyone else’? I uphold individuality and have protested social injustice throughout my schooling: changing my hair color, dressing uniquely, piercing ears beyond tradition, joining GSBA, and combating racism and discrimination. I'll keep fighting for social justice.",
            "The following paper explores the Biological and Sociocultural models as they relate to insomnia. The Biological model delves into genetic information that is passed down through inheritance, along with various medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural model, on the other hand, examines environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review examines these models and explains each piece of research chosen to further clarify and connect them. The strengths and weaknesses of the research findings are then critically evaluated.\n\nA sleep disorder can be categorized into several types: Primary sleep disorders, those related to another mental disorder, or those related to other issues. Primary sleep disorders are Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, while those related to mental disorders fall under Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other sleep disorders can be caused by medical complications or the intake of substances. Dyssomnias like Primary Insomnia and Primary Hypersomnia represent complications in adequate or maintained sleep, and Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/or automatic REM episodes. Parasomnias, on the other hand, are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities or physiological occurrences. These include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). The review primarily focuses on insomnia and general primary sleep disorders in relation to the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders centers around genes, heritable factors, and the physiological aspects of these disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are crucial for regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study involving mice found that there are specific GABAB receptors on orexin neurons responsible for these sleep/wake states. Activation of the GABAB receptor promotes sleep, while its inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist baclofen increased sleep time in the study (Matsuki et al., 2009). This suggests that animal models like mice can be generalized to human studies, highlighting a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence of this receptor could impair adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implications are that if this phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep, and any alteration of the receptor could naturally disturb sleep, impacting everyday activities like school, career, and tasks requiring focus",
            "This paper tackles three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It begins by explaining what the condition is, followed by the process of diagnosis, including common signs. Lastly, it offers ways teachers in mainstream classrooms can support students with CAPD.\n\nCAPD, or Auditory Processing Disorder, refers to how the central nervous system (CNS) processes and uses auditory information. More precisely, it's about the brain's ability to process sounds it hears, such as separating words or distinguishing them from background noise. Those with CAPD can hear just fine but struggle with how their brain interprets what they hear.\n\nThe disorder's roots date back to the mid-1950s, known then as \"auditory imperception\" when researchers studied children with communication issues. Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari started testing these children in 1954, and Kimura introduced dichotic testing in 1961, providing a model for the brain's underlying processes. A pivotal conference in 1977 sparked further research on the topic.\n\nCAPD can manifest in various ways: trouble locating sounds in space, difficulty distinguishing between sounds, trouble recognizing patterns, not being able to detect changes in speech, sounds getting blocked, and an inability to interpret sound clues or determine the sequence of auditory information.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, experts observe listening behaviors and test auditory functions using tools like questionnaires, surveys, and specialized tests. There isn't a definitive test or cause for CAPD yet. Many tests present multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli, and more advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals and measuring responses.",
            "Twelfth Night appears to suggest that while disguise can aid in sustaining long-term deception, it's crucial to eventually shed this new persona to avoid losing oneself. However, ending a deception can lead one to feel isolated. Thus, one must choose between self-preservation and maintaining relationships with others, knowing that some may react neutrally, while others may be offended by the deceit. The theme of deception in gender role reversal is particularly tricky, as it raises questions like: why does one feel compelled to adopt the guise of the opposite gender? In Viola's case, it's clear that her disguise serves as a protective measure. Having landed in a foreign land, she fears potential attackers and decides to pretend to be a man. This strategy works, but it also isolates her from women, denying her a valuable support network. What's more, she's so convincing that Olivia mistakenly falls in love with her, thinking she's Sebastian. “Here, my lord, Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) Additionally, Viola struggles with concealed romantic feelings between her and Orsino: “Boy, you’ve told me a thousand times/ You should never love a woman like I do.” (5.1. 260-261) Despite this, Twelfth Night may be seen as a portrayal of how deception can help uncover repressed emotions, especially with Olivia and Orsino. Some suggest that Viola/Cesario's appearance forces these characters to confront their subconscious desires. For instance, is Olivia drawn to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does she secretly have feelings for women? It's unlikely the latter, as Olivia seems more inclined to judge by appearance, as seen by her swift shift in affection from Cesario to Sebastian, and her newfound familial regard for Cesario/Viola: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)",
            "The harsh nature of German colonial rule, particularly in German South West Africa, has been well-documented, with notable atrocities including the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples. However, it's important to note that colonial empires are complex and varied, and the German colonial empire was no exception. Educational efforts across different colonies were also diverse. For instance, when the British took over German East Africa (now Tanzania), they encountered a significant number of literate Africans. German colonial education in Cameroon and other colonies was also commended by contemporary writers.\n\nIn stark contrast, South West Africa (present-day Namibia) had a drastically different educational landscape. Unlike in East Africa, where the government actively promoted native education, in South West Africa, the task of educating locals was primarily left to missionary societies with limited government support. While the government invested heavily in the education of Europeans, establishing schools and regulating missionary efforts, the educational gap between Europeans and natives persisted. Even after German rule ended, this disparity remained. In other German colonies, there were substantial numbers of literate Africans, but in South West Africa, most remained uneducated and illiterate. Various factors, including social, political, and economic ones, contributed to this disparity. This analysis seeks to delve deeper into these factors, focusing on new research into the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards natives.\n\nThere's a plethora of literature on education in the German colonial empire, much of it in German and written during or shortly after the colonial period. Early works primarily described educational systems, while later English-language studies compared these systems and analyzed specific aspects. These studies highlighted significant differences between colonies. Cohen's work on education in South West Africa and East Africa is particularly relevant. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa accounted for many of the unique characteristics of its educational system.\n\nGeographically, South West Africa offered a moderately comfortable climate, though much of it was arid desert. This attracted a European population that was relatively comfortable. By 1913, around 15,000 whites lived there, compared to the 5,336 in the next largest settler colony, East Africa.",
            "The category of Popular Music has evolved significantly over the past 100 years to encompass a multitude of genres, making it challenging to enumerate them all. Most, if not all genres—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk—have produced numerous sub and sub-sub genres. Notably, the Heavy Metal sub-genre of rock has become one of the most varied and expressive within popular music over the last 40 years. Its diversity stems from the early realization of the genre's flexibility, which has led to the creation of various sub-genres and further sub-sub-genres, continuing to this day.\n\nToday, Heavy Metal has developed so many distinct sub-niches that it's difficult to pin down what defines it. It has absorbed themes from other genres, originating from somewhere and evolving into the metal movement we know today. To fully comprehend today's metal music, one must understand the metal movement's essence and why it's considered a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nHeavy Metal is, in many ways, a movement defined by darkness. It can be seen as a \"music of more\" – more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. Less primitivism, more skill – metal bands showcase remarkable instrumental prowess. The genre is also heavily associated with drug use, particularly during the mid-70s psychedelic boom, where musicians created otherworldly records under the influence of drugs. It boasts dark, visceral qualities, which were quite new to the music scene, as much popular music lacked these darker emotional traits. Later generations of metal have also drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral elements prevalent in the Romantic Era. Lyrics, such as those from \"Helter Skelter,\" exemplify the darker side of the movement.\n\nThese lyrics from \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles illustrate the darker side of the band. The song's up-and-down rhythm is interpreted as a drug-induced rollercoaster, marking it as one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song with similar themes, with The Beatles aiming to prove they could match the heaviness and darkness of their rivals. The song was released on \"The White Album\" to demonstrate this.",
            "A few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike masterpieces, Henri Rousseau was already crafting his own dreams, both literally and figuratively. In 1910, The Dream, one of his renowned Post-Impressionist paintings, showcased a woman marveling at her dreamland, but it also reflected Rousseau's own dreams and aspirations as a painter. His journey was one of internal conflict: should he conform to or mimic established styles to gain acceptance in the art world he admired, or forge his own unique path? To fully understand The Dream, one must first know Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, France, he was the son of a successful tinsmith and hardware dealer. Rousseau had no formal art training and was a gabelou, or municipal toll service employee, until he was forty. After losing his first wife and eight of his children, he found solace in painting. Unlike his contemporaries, he was a folk painter, dreaming of recognition and acceptance, much like the average members of his class. His late start and competition with other renowned artists added to his struggle. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon noted that while Matisse feared painting tritely, Rousseau longed to create conventional art that would earn him a place among the Artiste Français.",
            "Many a wise mind has pondered the deep link between ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. I firmly believe there's a profound reason for this. As John Keats once wrote in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While much of what we learn in life comes from education or experience, it seems we instinctually grasp ethics and aesthetics without such teachings. Both seek to describe rather than prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty aim to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than laying down rules for judgment or creation. Criticisms of art or morals can never fully capture its essence. Discussions about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for instance, may focus on elements like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but ultimately, these don't explain why it's considered good art. Instead, when discussing favorite works of art or literature, one often hears a phrase like, \"There's just something about it\" before a more complex explanation. I believe both art and morals possess this intangible quality, this \"je ne sais quoi,\" making them transcendent. This connection between ethics and aesthetics is especially evident in literature. As McKean puts it, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality.\" Literature's ability to convey moral values is as integral as it is in life itself. Living inherently involves values, and literature is significant because it reflects these values.",
            "Today's Germany is a powerful, unified country with a rich cultural tapestry weaving from the peaks of the Alps in München to the shores of the Baltic Sea in Kiel. This unique blend of culture is felt throughout Germany, from Köln on the Rhine, through the heart of the country, to the Saxon city of Dresden along the Elbe. Given its rich cultural heritage, it's no surprise that Germany as we know it today is a fusion of various tribes and sources.\n\nGermania, the ancestral home of the Germans, has a debated origin story. Some scholars, like Tacitus, claim the name came from the Germanic tribe known as Tungrians, who were previously called Germans before crossing the Rhine to fight the Gauls. Julius Caesar, in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, used the term “Germanus” to distinguish between conquered Gauls and unconquered Germanic tribes. Others suggest the name might come from the Old English word \"ger,\" meaning spear, or the Old Irish \"garim,\" signifying loud, noisy people.\n\nTacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" wrote that he considered the Germans to be aboriginal and not mixed with other races through immigration or intercourse. He described the harsh conditions of Germania, with its wild landscape, harsh climate, and sullen inhabitants, making it an unlikely destination for those seeking to emigrate.\n\nThe Romans, though they did not initially settle in Germania, sent expeditions to trade with the Germanic tribes and sometimes led military campaigns. However, they mostly returned to their vast empire, leaving the Germanic tribes to live on the empire's borders.\n\nOver time, these tribes began to appear in the middle of the first century, trading goods and skills, including serving in the Roman army.",
            "Below me, I stared, my mind blankly processing the scene before me. Unanimated and silent, I studied the view with practiced detachment, yet refused to connect it to any abstract understanding. Thoughts flowed in and out like a river, leaving me with an almost liquid experience of the moment. I had bought an art instruction book, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,\" to learn how to draw. One technique in the book was to frame a picture within a square, simplifying complex scenes. Looking at the bowl of fruit on the table, I was too overwhelmed to apply this technique. Instead, I just stood there, awestruck. My hand gripped the pencil, muscles tensing and relaxing as I tried to capture the scene. The water was clear and smooth, but the package of brown waste refused to budge, stuck like a slug on the toilet's bottom. With a mop in hand, I frowned at the offending mess. Flushes came and went, as did my introspective moments. Then, I reached for the toilet paper and began wrapping it around my hand like a mummy, creating an oven mitt. Standing up, I slowly dipped my hand into the bowl, as if preparing a turkey for Thanksgiving.",
            "Teenagers are perishing behind the wheel, and several factors are combining to create this deadly trend among young American drivers. The National Institutes of Health highlight that the teen brain is not fully equipped to handle the perils of driving due to its immaturity. Lack of experience is also a significant contributor, leading to more fatal accidents, rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road.\nTeenagers fare worse when accompanied by their peers, a common occurrence as anyone with a modicum of common sense knows. A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center revealed a correlation between the age of passengers and traffic accidents.\nCalifornia and other states have implemented provisional licenses to enhance teen driver safety, restricting driving hours and prohibiting other minors as passengers. However, these are merely temporary fixes. The core issue is that as a collective, young drivers are not adequately prepared to manage the risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman suggests that even 18 is too young for an unrestricted driver's license. USA Today reports that Zuckerman's research indicates a common desire among those under 19-20 to take risks for the thrill. Thus, delaying driving until this tendency abates is sensible. If we persist in licensing young teens to drive, we will continue to witness deadly accidents, and the death toll is likely to escalate in the next few years. By 2010, Baby Boomers' children will be eligible to drive, resulting in millions of new teen drivers hitting the road.\nLegislation addressing this issue would be relatively straightforward. Schools could continue to offer driver’s education classes for future drivers, but no one under 18 could operate a motor vehicle. A provisional permit could precede a full driver’s license, with a specific number of practical driver’s training hours still required, based on the majority of states' current standards (in California, for instance, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult). This legislation would be both reasonable and effective in protecting teens across the nation.\nThe proposed legislation is not a novel idea.",
            "While browsing through the Library of Congress’s collection of early Edison films, I stumbled upon a series of fifteen trick films, created between 1895 and 1901. These films primarily utilize creative editing to create illusions. My study focused on describing the poetics of these trick films, as well as examining the unique features of the later ones. Generally, these trick films of the late 19th century were confined within a frontal proscenium, used no camera movement, and consisted of long and medium shots, adhering to the rule that one shot equaled one film. However, a few films from the early 20th century dared to break these rules by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nOne common aspect among these trick films is their filming within an interior set, framed by a frontal proscenium, with the camera remaining stationary. This was a common technique in early films, drawing inspiration from theater and vaudeville magic acts. Consequently, figures in these trick films typically moved side-to-side within the frame, rarely walking towards or away from the camera. For instance, in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors enter from the right and move back and forth horizontally, with the camera not following them as they exit the frame.\n\nThis frontal proscenium style also resulted in long and medium shots being more common, with close-ups being virtually absent. This method mirrored the theater and vaudeville traditions, where the audience saw the entire performance at once, framed by the stage borders. Actors did not move towards the camera, so close-ups were never used.\n\nMost early trick films followed the rule that one conceptual shot equaled one film, limiting their length to about a minute or less. This also restricted their dramatic or narrative potential, with many focusing on short vaudeville-style tricks like magic and disappearing acts, with minimal story. However, it’s important to note that in a trick film, a single conceptual shot in the viewer's eyes does not correspond to a single physical shot. A single \"shot\" could be composed of multiple joined shots to create illusions. Carefully examine The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), where the physical shot with Mary’s severed \"head\" begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate advocate for Republican ideals. Although he primarily worked as an agriculturalist, his short stint in politics and his dedication to his profession shaped him into a steadfast champion of personal liberty and government. His commitment to agriculture was the cornerstone of his views on sovereignty, the Constitution, and even the judicial system.\n\nJohn Taylor saw the United States as an excellent opportunity to establish an ideal system because there were no native traditions to hinder its creation, allowing for a government of self-rule. He strongly believed in the natural rights of man and their interdependence, arguing that denying any right diminishes the value of all. These rights should remain beyond the government's reach. He viewed the \"state of nature\" as a place where the fittest and most cunning prospered, but in civilization, this should not be the case.\n\nTo create such a society, Taylor believed a government must account for the inherent good and evil within man. He held rigid views on dualistic morality, stating, \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" He defined good principles as those that protect private property, improve agriculture, and discourage capitalism. He believed a government founded on these principles would function fairly regardless of its administration, which would invariably be led by greed and self-interest. Self-interest, he thought, was man's primary motivator, but it was only considered evil when it led to societies that exploited others. A good government was necessary to contain man's natural evil, and even then, it must be closely observed to prevent the introduction of bad principles.\n\nTaylor, like many other staunch Republicans of his time, advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He sought a Federal government with limited rights and powers as explicitly stated in the Constitution. He understood that an extensive Federal government could become expensive and despotic. However, he believed a simple, literal interpretation was dangerous without reference to the writers' intent. He considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, because it more clearly described the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "Referring back to Figure 17, there was a sharp drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. This was a bit disheartening, and it's tricky to pinpoint the exact reason. With the arrival of winter in a New England campus, there's a natural decrease in commuters who travel by bicycle or foot, which could account for part of the decline. December also signals the end of the fall semester, where everyone is busy wrapping up schoolwork and processing grades, possibly causing commuter logs to fall off the radar. Additionally, December ushers in the holiday season, leading to a month-long break for both students and faculty, during which many don't need to come to campus. Classes resume in late January, which aligns with the low number of logs observed. However, the February dip remains unexplained. One might speculate that any new initiative can experience an initial surge of enthusiasm followed by a natural decline. To counteract this, we organized the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a special blitz campaign that boosted log submissions for that month. Thus, maintaining project momentum in the face of both seasonal and semester breaks was a significant challenge. Another hurdle for such projects is that people's love for driving their cars is deeply ingrained in our culture. Therefore, offering incentives to engage in alternative commuting methods is crucial. We distributed numerous prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, an independent bookstore, and even some larger chain stores. It would have been intriguing to see if even more substantial prizes, such as a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car, could have increased participation and engagement. The nature of the prizes didn't change throughout the project. If the prizes had gradually increased in value, it might have helped maintain enthusiasm. Gift cards seemed sufficient at the start, but announcing the addition of a couple of bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January could have potentially increased participation and engagement.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a financial instrument designed to mirror an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets, but trades like a stock. This flexibility makes ETFs attractive, as they offer the benefits of index funds, such as diversification, combined with the advantages of stock ownership, like the ability to short sell or buy on margin. However, ETFs come with their share of drawbacks, including the need to pay commissions on each trade, similar to buying stocks. Additionally, one of the standout features of ETFs is the wide range of funds available. It's essential for smart investors to assess whether these benefits genuinely exist and to what extent. For this analysis, we'll examine the ETF IHF and compare its top 10 holdings to see if owning a single ETF offers comparable benefits to owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks. We'll also explore if there's a better configuration of these stocks that could yield a more optimal Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nTo simplify our evaluation, we'll focus on the top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets. Here are those holdings and their respective percentages:\n\nTo gauge how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we'll calculate their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming the portfolio consists entirely of these ten stocks in the ETF's established proportions. The calculations are presented in the chart below.\n\nFrom the chart, it's clear that a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings yields a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Additionally, the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF's overall Beta. These results suggest that a portfolio of the top 10 holdings could offer a higher return with a lower Beta. However, we must consider if the portfolios' means are statistically different from each other.\n\nTo determine if these portfolios differ significantly, we'll calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalize it to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation with that of the ETF IHF.",
            "\"Dream-land\" is one of Edgar Allan Poe's self-claimed superior poems. In this work, Poe employs the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, which Mabbott links back to Virgil. Virgil used this term to refer to an island north of Britain, considered the edge of the known world by the Greeks. Although Virgil indeed utilized this term, some credit should be given to a more contemporary source, as Poe was particularly interested in German authors. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" highlights the similarities between their poems, concluding that Poe was emulating Goethe.\n\nOxford Companion to English Literature notes that Goethe was a notable writer, famous for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts— the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe's death. Within the second part of \"Faust,\" there is a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem recounts the tale of a king who loses his wife after she gives him a goblet as a gift. Driven to grief and despair, he drinks heavily and eventually decides to end his life, leaving the goblet to the sea. The character of the King of Thule and the description of the narrator in \"Dream-Land\" share striking similarities, possibly serving as a dark mirror to Poe's own grief and struggle with alcohol.\n\nPoe references \"Thule\" twice in his writings. In \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" he uses the phrase \"ultra Thule,\" and in \"Dream-Land,\" he employs the term twice, framing the poem. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes the landscape of Thule as dark, lonely, and haunted by deceased friends, with a world devoid of color. These scenes echo the themes in \"The King of Thule,\" where the king is consumed by grief, loneliness, and a loss of will to live. The poem reads as if the speaker has stepped into Goethe's narrative.\n\nGoethe was a notable author whom Poe would have known, even if only peripherally through his respect for Tennyson. Poe himself acknowledged his admiration for Tennyson when asked. Beyond his connection to Tennyson, Poe would have been exposed to Goethe's work through various reproductions and translations, given the widespread popularity of his works after the original publications.",
            "Could a customer who suffered injuries from slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages if the store manager knew about the spill twice and didn't clean it for half an hour because he was having dinner? A judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer's punitive damage claim. To win, Palmer must prove that Martin's actions were malicious, meaning he acted with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm. She can argue that Martin should have cleaned the spill, as multiple customers had been injured from slipping before Palmer's accident, despite knowing the risks. While Martin's actions might seem despicable, they are reasonable given the six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009. On October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee named Rich Wayne told Martin about the spill, but Martin was on his dinner break. At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, informed Martin again, and he still didn't clean it. At 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and fell, sustaining a serious back injury. Palmer is suing D&D for damages, and we're considering a partial summary against the punitive damage claim. In California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for breach of non-contractual obligations if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud, or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct intending harm or, absent intent, conduct that's despicable and committed with a willful disregard of others' rights or safety. Courts have ruled conduct malicious when the defendant was aware of the probable dangers and deliberately failed to avoid them. Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "Almost four years ago, I delved into a course on Islam at CBC. The class sparked passionate debates about whether Islam is inherently hostile. This question feels increasingly pertinent today. Reflecting on the 9/11 aftermath, I've seen a shift in American mass media's perception of Islam and extremists, from hostility to an extreme form of tolerance. I doubt that in 2001, a presidential candidate named Barack Obama, with a clear Muslim background, could have been plausible.\n\nThe Prophet's Biography, I find, is intriguing yet puzzling. According to historical accounts, Muhammad's life seems to contradict his portrayal in the biography. Past knowledge suggests he forced tribes to convert to Islam through conquest, but the biography depicts him as a misunderstood martyr, humbled by others until they saw the truth in his teachings.\n\nStriking similarities between Jesus' ministries and Muhammad's 'miracles' catch my attention. The instance of multiplying mutton and milk for forty men is notable. This narrative style, I believe, aims to present Muhammad as a humble prophet, relying on truth and miracles rather than proving himself. Such attributions diminish Jesus' life and personhood, as if Muhammad is stealing his glory.\n\nMoreover, many stories in the biography seem to serve as proof of 'witnesses' converting to Islam independently. However, many accounts are relayed thirdhand, diluting their credibility. These stories are less persuasive because they're not firsthand and appear more suspicious.\n\nWhat bothers me most is attempting to elevate Muhammad to a godly, humble, wise, and gentle figure. History contradicts this portrayal, suggesting that Muhammad's rise to power was less gentle and more complex.",
            "The teachings and beliefs that Jesus held during his life were quickly abandoned as Christian thought evolved after his death. When observed in broader terms, Christianity progressively distanced itself from its origins. Today, the world is witnessing a growing awareness and unprecedented forward-moving trend. While traditionalists persist and resist new ideas, they may not have enough influence to alter the collective. Among Christians, historical understanding will significantly increase in years to come. A desire will arise to differentiate added doctrines from Christianity’s core principles. This process may take generations or centuries, but the reversal of Christian history is inevitable. A movement will emerge, stripping away layers of doctrine, akin to rewinding time, until only Jesus' original teachings remain. When this trend permeates the United States and Europe, masses will worship as if living during Jesus' time, adhering solely to his ideas. The church, as an institution, will maintain strength, leading the way. However, theological uniformity will increase, reducing diversity. Between regions, denominations, and divisions, similarities will outweigh differences. History is filled with reversals; Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire, which later became a Christian state. Similarly, our country shifted from African-American slavery to leadership. The upcoming reversal in Christianity will undo history and diversity. This process will be facilitated by interpreting Jesus' words metaphorically, not literally. What has transpired since Jesus' lifetime?\n\nLooking back in history, we find only Judaism, the foundation for Christianity. Monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were central to the religion by the time Rome controlled Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population was divided: Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the majority of common people.",
            "The novel \"The Jungle\" by Upton Sinclair serves as a stark illustration of the inherent greed and self-interest of people. It highlights how individuals prioritize their own prosperity at the expense of others, never considering those less fortunate. Sinclair effectively portrays this through the factory owners and managers who strive for nothing but the expansion of their businesses, disregarding any obstacles or collateral damage. The text paints a vivid image of the detrimental effects of industrialization, as \"the line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". This smog and pollution, along with animal waste runoff, are indicative of the owners' apathy towards human and environmental well-being. The same callous disregard is evident in their treatment of employees, who are exploited for maximum profit, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". Workers are subjected to harsh conditions, lengthy hours, and sudden layoffs, all without any compensation or job assistance. The absence of protective laws or regulations allowed such mistreatment to flourish. The workers, laboring and living in such deplorable conditions, were effectively treated as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Many writers employ various tactics to evoke specific feelings or perspectives in their readers regarding pivotal subjects. F. Scott Fitzgerald deploys several of these techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. He oftentimes pairs adjectives with nouns that don't typically align to create a particular atmosphere. Additionally, Fitzgerald imbues symbols with meaning and reuses them for the same purpose. He employs this strategy with numerous colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald establishes significance for these colors, particularly white/gray, which he later uses to convey certain feelings about important elements.\n\n[REWRITE]Fitzgerald's description of white/gray as uniformity, with white representing a touch of elegance and high society and gray signifying age and weariness, is evident from the beginning of the book. Daisy and Jordan are frequently referred to as \"in white\" (8), and everyone at Gatsby's party wears white, such as Nick in \"white flannels\" (41), Tom in a \"white shirt\" (36), and Catherine as \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only exceptions are when Nick observes Gatsby's party: \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further underscores this by coloring mundane subjects with these colors: Nick goes \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the names on Nick's timetable are \"gray names\" (61), and Catherine's apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\" (28). Simple or ordinary people and places are also described in white or gray: Daisy and Jordan shared a \"white girlhood\" (19), the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"gray\" Italian child (26), and the dog-seller as a \"gray old man\" (27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has established the meaning of white/gray, he utilizes these colors to signify unimportance or uniformity around certain subjects. This first applies to Daisy. After a prolonged absence of any notable usage of these colors, Fitzgerald portrays Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster\"; readers start to perceive Daisy as less of a character and more like a uniform addition, an object of Gatsby's longing (74). Fitzgerald employs this technique repeatedly around Daisy to reinforce this uniformity, such as the \"gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar\" (18) and her \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County is a hotbed of agricultural activity, thanks to its mild, sunny climate. Crops grown here include tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There's a robust market for organic community-supported agriculture in the area, with many local organizations having long waiting lists for organic eggs and milk. Organic farms often offer tours and recreational activities like hiking and birdwatching. This type of operation can both benefit from government programs and improve habitat quality, allowing for farm tours and educational programs.   While organic farming has higher costs and lower efficiency than conventional farming, it promotes greater plant and wildlife biodiversity in the area due to the absence of chemicals. Additional efforts to benefit wildlife, such as planting cover crops and managing plant growth, may also incur higher labor costs. Therefore, a landowner in this scenario might seek financial help to maximize profits and habitat quality.   The land in question is a 160-acre parcel near the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It's a mix of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. This area is part of the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion and is home to over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered or declining. The land was once inhabited by Native Americans and later used for cattle grazing and wood production.   To explore viable options for a small farmer, I chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs for cost mitigation and wildlife preservation. As a model, I found an organic farm in the same area.",
            "Culture plays a crucial role in any negotiation. It's not simply about what a culture is, but also what it isn't and what it signifies. Culture is diverse, not singular or uniform. Generalizations like “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating” are overly broad. Instead of focusing on broad stereotypes, it's more beneficial to understand the relevance of a culture to the negotiation at hand and how it influences these conversations. Approaching a foreign culture means we relate it to our own and make comparisons. Understanding a culture often involves exploring its history and recognizing its prejudices. Rather than passing judgment or trying to change it, one must accept it and operate within its boundaries, especially when negotiations are weak. If a negotiator finds themselves in a foreign environment, respect for traditions and beliefs can help overcome cultural barriers and progress the negotiation.\n\nCulture isn't limited to national differences. Even within a single nation, companies can develop their own unique corporate culture, which can vary widely. For example, some cultures may stress long office hours, while others promote a more relaxed schedule. Corporate culture can be seen in dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. Some companies encourage general employee philanthropy, while others limit it to “approved” causes. Even within American culture, there's significant diversity from company to company and region to region. While some cultures may appear uniform to outsiders, they often hide deeper complexities. Understanding the values of a culture is crucial, as they provide the reasons behind its behavior. If a culture values “saving face” or communal harmony, a negotiator won't publicly shame their company or superior to win. Conversely, a negotiator from a culture that prioritizes aggressive bargains won't rush to settle. Considering these cultural nuances beforehand is essential, but also learning about the personal background of the opposing negotiator can make the negotiation more effective.",
            "\"An arrogant fool has declared, 'There is no God.' This sentiment is first found in the Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and forms the basis for St. Anselm's argument on God's existence. Similarly, St. Thomas Aquinas holds this belief. Given that we must compare their arguments defending this concept, we assume they both correctly believe in the Bible's God. To fairly compare their arguments, we must consider the specific God they each describe. Both authors argue for the existence of God, but neither fully establishes a comprehensive foundation for belief.\n\nStarting with St. Anselm's argument, it proposes that understanding God lies within our own minds. He suggests that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot conceptualize his nonexistence. While this reasoning is complex and sometimes unclear, it essentially states that the proof for God is found within our own minds. We don't need external evidence; we only need to examine our inherent knowledge. This idea is called faith in Christian texts.\n\nConversely, St. Thomas Aquinas argues that God's existence can be proven through reason and empirical evidence, without the need for faith. This approach aids evangelism, as it allows for logical persuasion rather than reliance on faith. Aquinas presents five logical arguments supporting God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument shows that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for his existence. If you know all but one piece of a puzzle, you can deduce the missing piece's characteristics and existence without seeing it.",
            "Back in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would later be known as Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he renounced worldly attachments and achieved enlightenment, which led to the establishment of Buddhism—Theravada Buddhism being the most traditional sect. Over the course of twenty-five hundred years, the religion has evolved from its original teachings. This evolution is evident in Theravada countries like Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is celebrated. Monks and laypeople both participate in this ritual, despite Buddha never having taught about such celebrations. Changes in the religion range from superficial traditions to core beliefs and practices. Both the monastic and lay communities have had to adapt their doctrinal principles over time, influenced by both positive and negative external and internal factors.\n\nI'll be using some specific terms in this discussion. Internal forces refer to influences from within the Buddhist community, regardless of monastic status, while external forces are from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that seek to harm the Buddhist community based on negative perceptions of Buddhism. Benign forces, on the other hand, do not intend to harm or help the community but may have such effects as a byproduct.\n\nTo understand Theravada Buddhism, let's start with its core beliefs and doctrines. Buddhists find refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma consists of the Tripitaka—three baskets—of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka explores the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism, like Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these concepts allows one to end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth. When one achieves enlightenment, lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) also cease. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for living, including five precepts for laypeople (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances) and many more for monks. The most fundamental doctrine is the four noble truths: life is suffering (Dukkha), attachment causes suffering, suffering can be overcome, and there is a path to end suffering.",
            "From 1836 to 1893, the United States and Mexico were locked in a long-standing rivalry, lasting 57 years. The peak of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848, where the U.S. took Texas and the American Southwest from Mexico. Beyond this major conflict, numerous other skirmishes occurred between these two nations, finally simmering down before the First World War. The tension started due to disagreements over religion, culture, and key material interests (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis is not unique to just the U.S. and Mexico. Nations sharing borders often have conflicts over interests, which can lead to rivalries. David M. Pletcher (1977) pointed out that only Mexico and Cuba have such enduring problems with the U.S. (p. 41). These two nations are geographically close and have historically been rivals, unlike many other Latin American countries that have maintained good relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences were a substantial issue, mirroring historic divisions. Sally Frahm (2001) noted that in the 18th and 19th centuries, Americans opposed Catholicism and monarchy, similar to the Cold War's ideological struggles between the U.S. and the Soviet Union (p. 86). The distrust between the English and Spanish, inherited from colonial times, was a significant barrier to friendly foreign relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) identified 17 disputes during this 57-year period, most of which were territorial issues involving border raids and frontier problems. Bandit attacks from American towns were a prevalent problem that continued until both nations exerted military control on their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).\n\nThe rivalry's end is attributed to Mexico's growing dependence on the U.S. (Schmitt 1974, p. 109) and the U.S.'s shift from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico in the late 19th century (p. 110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, I found myself unexpectedly disabled by an illness that I had never known existed. At the time, I was a nurse, a job I chose out of a deep-seated need for security and stability, something I had lacked as a child. \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick\" was the mantra that echoed through my adolescence. Even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist, preferably a bit of both, I chose nursing. However, here I was, 46 years old, single, and unable to work after being stricken by an illness. After years of living on Social Security Disability, I have little left to call my own. Each day is a struggle, an assault on my security, safety, and self-esteem. Everything in my life is uncertain, yet there is one truth I know to be absolute: I could not have endured these years without the help of my family and a few good friends. And believe me, when disaster strikes, you don't feel strong. My point is that emergencies will always arise, both big and small. No matter how well you prepare, some things are too big to overcome alone. I agree that we in the U.S. should not rely solely on big government, as it is crumbling. Instead, I believe we should learn to trust and help each other. The Conservatives in the U.S. talk about \"rugged individualism\" that built this country, but what truly kept our forefathers going in hard times was compassion, mutual respect, and sharing resources. Pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. So, by all means, be prepared. I am ready. I have a disaster kit, first aid supplies, water purifying tablets, plastic sheeting, duct tape for the windows in case of a biological attack, and plenty of flashlights, batteries, candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have the land and resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food, do it. It's a great idea, as is a wood stove, as long as you don't live in an apartment. But while you're at it, get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms change the way they do? Are there limits or bounds that shape the path of evolutionary changes? Even today, the notion that we can describe living forms mathematically remains a distant dream. Yet, recent advancements have seen mathematical modeling applied to various aspects of mollusk shell formation, both in their development and evolution. Our research aims to combine mathematical modeling of Prunum's developmental and evolutionary changes with experimental studies to understand how these changes occur and how they scale. We analyzed X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative traits that can simulate shell morphologies. These data were fed into the software program CerioShell. We created hypothetical shell shapes to interpret potential morphological changes in Prunum. Our results are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to better grasp macroevolutionary events in this group. Shells can be visualized as tubes that wrap around an imaginary axis, or columella, through 360 degrees of space. These loops, called whorls, expand at varying speeds. The largest whorl is the body whorl, and the spire consists of all other whorls. The aperture is the opening through which the animal extends. Shells can be examined from different angles: apical (looking from the top), basal (from the bottom), apertural (the usual way, with the aperture facing upward), and abapertural. To count whorls, first view the shell from the apical side, locate the first suture, draw a line, and count whorls from this point. Each whorl can be estimated to a quarter of a whorl. Imagine the shell as a series of apertures moving through time and space as the animal constructs its shell.

While the country is making strides towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation, improvements in child and maternal health are significantly lagging behind the required progress to meet the 2015 targets. The reasons for this stagnation are complex, pointing to the need to bolster the overall health system rather than focusing solely on specific programmatic interventions.\n\nIndonesia has seen an increase in births attended by skilled healthcare workers, with 72% of births now meeting this benchmark. However, this figure includes traditional workers like midwives who lack the capacity to handle complicated pregnancies, thus contributing to high maternal mortality rates. The progress in this area is somewhat deceptive as it still falls short of comprehensive improvement. Additionally, there has been a drop in the percentage of diarrhea cases among children under five years old that are treated by healthcare professionals. Postnatal care data is incomplete, indicating a substantial concern in this area with low rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain low, at around 4%, which is a cause for concern. The rate is 7% in urban areas compared to just 2% in rural settings, highlighting the issue of inequity in service coverage. Clearly, healthcare services are centralized in urban areas. Another major concern is vertical equity, with a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, indicating that the poor face significant barriers to accessing healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nIn contemplating the next steps to enhance neonatal and maternal health indicators, the fundamental question is how to best address the lack of services. Should Indonesia adopt program-specific approaches or focus on strengthening the entire health system without singling out pre and post-pregnancy care for mothers and infants? Programmatic approaches, with their targeted and manageable objectives, often yield quicker results. However, there are drawbacks to consider. Heavily investing in one area may divert funding and resources from others, as has been seen with international funding for HIV/AIDS impacting the family planning sector. Moreover, running multiple parallel programs can lead to duplicated services and uncoordinated efforts, resulting in increased paperwork and administrative burdens.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their meticulous detail and focus on the aristocracy of the era. Two notable exceptions are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, which incorporate elements of mystery and the bizarre, deviating from the typical Victorian narrative. These elements enhance the characters, providing insight into their motivations and emotions. The peculiar happenings in these novels often take the form of dream sequences or dreamlike states, revealing various aspects of the characters' inner lives.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, these dreamlike sequences frequently unveil Oliver's inner turmoil, the pain he experiences, and his awareness of the true nature of his surroundings. For instance, when Oliver relives the shooting in chapter 28, he is overwhelmed by the event as if he were in a dream. This vivid recollection underscores his lack of control over the events and his desperate straits. The constant pain and fear he experiences highlight his helplessness and the sense of defeat that is beginning to take hold of him. It seems as if Fagin's influence has broken him, rendering him unable to react or even attempt to control the events unfolding around him. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over his circumstances, with the question of whose will brought about his misfortune lingering ominously in the air. The passage also suggests that Oliver is losing his ability to react, as his life's events overwhelm him.\n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” (Dickens, 220)\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in its fleeting ours.”",
            "A few years back, I worked at an after-school program offering tutoring to elementary-aged students. I focused on helping them with subjects they were struggling in, with my strength being in English and reading. One of the instructors asked me to assist a boy named Adrian, who was having difficulty reading. It didn't take long for me to realize that something was amiss; he pronounced some letters correctly while others he butchered, which was quite odd. Adrian was of Latino descent and spoke excellent English, but he had a peculiar problem with understanding the English alphabet. I was his babysitter one day when his mom walked in. She only spoke Spanish, and my Spanish was limited, but we managed to communicate. I realized then that Adrian could read but didn't know the English alphabet well. I hope my discovery helped him, as I'm not sure it did. I share this to highlight the issue of language barriers in schools, especially here in California. It’s not as obvious as one might think. Even a child speaking perfect English can struggle with reading. I believe everyone agrees this problem exists, so what's the solution? For Adrian, it was English reading tutoring for the alphabet and pronunciations. For many children who barely speak English, the solution is complex. No single approach works. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes – none of these, alone, will fix the problem. The key is combining them all.",
            "From the moment we're young, we're told about something out there that's bigger than us, beyond our understanding. Some of us learn about it at Sunday school, others at Temple, or through our own introspective journeys. Many accept the faith passed down by their parents, while others reject it, believing only in their own egocentric universe. No matter our path, we seek to define ourselves through our unique perspectives on spirituality, searching for a light to guide us through the darkness.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said when I asked him his favorite type of bird. We sat on the porch, the rain drumming on the tin roof overhead as we smoked. The gutters carried the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge. He looked out into the rain, his gaze both searching and remembering. He'd grown thin, his clothes hanging loosely, his hair sparse. He avoided eye contact, and I felt alone, afraid, unable to talk about how much I'd miss him. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair closer, and joined him in watching the rain fall on the June twilight.\n\nMy father passed in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation had prolonged his suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors' predictions. I couldn't watch him pass, so I didn't. I wanted to remember him by how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew him better than anyone, and I knew Dad wouldn't want his only child to witness his death. So, I curled up in my bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "The classic \"Gothic Novel\" is essentially a blend of \"Old\" and \"New\" traditions, as Ian Watt points out in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic genre has been both criticized and celebrated, accused of lacking depth and praised for its capacity to evoke a sense of the 'terrible sublime' (Burke). The foundation of the Gothic genre was laid by Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, which combined elements from both \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances to create a new literary style. Walpole utilized \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre draws heavily from medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even when The Castle of Otranto was published, the term \"gothic\" was used to describe various peoples, styles, and time periods, often seen as archaic or unsophisticated compared to \"modern\" societal and literary advancements. The fusion of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" elements and the new format of the novel (allowing readers a more intimate look into the psychology of characters) is what has kept the Gothic genre relevant and fresh for readers, even centuries removed from its original creation.",
            "Supply chain management is the series of steps involved in moving products from customer orders through raw materials, production, and distribution to the final customer. The term was coined in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. He described it as the process of planning, implementing, and controlling the supply chain to meet customer needs efficiently. The main components of a supply chain are: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these components to ensure optimal customer service. Production is the first step in this process, serving as the foundation. It involves deciding on the 'when', 'why', 'where', and 'how' of production. Managers must understand customer demands, which can be gauged through market analysis. Once the market is understood, managers determine what products to produce and in what quantities. The next step is choosing the optimal location for production based on volume, quality, and cost. After that, managers focus on scheduling and equipment maintenance. Production is crucial for the supply chain, with every detail being vital to avoid delays and costs. For instance, I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target, where there were detailed processes for every task, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments. This structure ensures smooth operations and clear direction for employees. The second key element is supply, which involves strategic decisions about core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. A company may have multiple divisions for a single product, each with its own equipment and specialists. Managers must determine which division is best for each process. Outsourcing can be used to improve velocity, which refers to providing quality and flexibility while reducing costs.",
            "Adolf Hitler is alive in Burma, the sign reads.\n\nEllen Page, renowned for her role in Juno, stands alone on a street corner, a cardboard sign held above her head. The message, scrawled in Sharpie, is about the current state of Burma, also known as Myanmar. A Southeast Asian country ruled by a repressive military junta that came to power in 1962 through a coup d’état. In 2007, peacefully protesting monks sparked the \"Saffron Revolution,\" named for their robes. Initially, the government allowed the monks to gather, but the protests escalated into a war between the monks and the military, who invaded monasteries. Foreign journalists were imprisoned or killed, with Kenji Nagai, a Japanese photojournalist, killed on September 27th, 2007. The official death toll is 13, but Colonel Hla Win, a defector, claims it's in the thousands.\n\nThis isn't new. History is filled with examples of governments suppressing dissent and maintaining complete control. Early Roman emperors claimed divine right to rule. Japanese emperors are believed to be gods, and our current President Bush has weekly calls with Ted Haggard, leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary of the Republican Party.\n\nFamous examples abound. The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests saw intellectuals, labor activists, and students killed. The death toll ranges from 200 to 3,000. The Rwandan genocide in the 90s saw Hutu militia, aided by the government, kill Tutsis and political moderates. Hitler's Third Reich, with its systematic killing of Jews, is another stark example.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring impact on jazz is largely due to his longevity and, by extension, his skill in shaping his orchestra. Ellington's piano presence is often subtle in many compositions, but as a composer, he excelled at crafting rich, intricate pieces that showcased the individual talents of his band members. He created a framework that allowed soloists to improvise freely, while also writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that highlighted each musician's unique style. This approach emphasized the overall tone of the orchestra, creating original and coherent sounds for each piece. Ellington's ability to master the individual players' sounds and how they fit together in a growing group enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's sound and innovation, mentioning Creole Love Call as an early example of his use of voice as a jazz instrument. This piece demonstrates his ability to add texture and color to a piece without lyrics, and also shows how he complemented his soloists' styles throughout his career. Creole Love Call, a slow, deliberate 12-bar blues piece with six choruses, features:\n- Chorus 1: A call and response between voice and reeds, starting smooth and melodic, transitioning to a rougher sound.\n- Chorus 2: A muted trumpet solo by the reeds, elaborating on the basic melody with extended blue notes.\n- Chorus 3: A sweeping clarinet solo in the high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\n- Chorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by brass and reed sections.\n- Chorus 5: The climactic chorus, where reeds initiate the call and response in the high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\n- Chorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with a \"growl\" solo by the voice.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add tone color in this piece is just one example of a stylistic trait that runs throughout his work. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing uses Miley's vocal elements and Cox's instrumental voice to create a rich, complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) further extends these ideas, with Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a key member of Ellington's orchestra, introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "She had always felt an emptiness inside, a yearning for something that wouldn't be filled. It began at 14, when she was discovering her teenage life, and it stayed with her at 17. She had decided she wanted a person, not an object, yet no one appealed to her. Boys would sometimes be attracted to her, but she felt no interest. She often questioned this, trying to figure out what could cause such a sensation in a teenage girl. Years of contemplation brought several theories, but nothing solid enough to speculate on. So she lived her life, continually puzzling over her desires.\n\nA quiet day at home was usually peaceful. Her parents were calm and never argued, and arguments with her were rare. They'd only disagree about her asserting her independence and lively personality. She was quite likeable, even with her parents, due to her energetic and kind nature.\n\nToday, though, was not peaceful. As she wandered from room to room seeking inspiration, she heard a sudden scream from the kitchen, her mother's voice. She rushed in, panicking, \"Mom?! What's wrong?!\" She saw her mother on the floor, moaning \"Ow,\" in short breaths. Her daughter rushed to her side and placed a hand on her to help. \"Ouch ... sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital.\" The words were rushed and strained, and her daughter understood her immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I should pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands, and at that moment, the hero of the house was grateful for her strength. She carried her mother to the car, laid her down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought the harsh scent of disinfectant and sickness, but she didn't sense that, as her mind was consumed with helping her mother. She rushed her to the doctors and they quickly moved her to a rolling bed to be examined. Her daughter sat worriedly, waiting.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a step stool while trying to reach a vase from the highest cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that sticking to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as indicated by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is linked to a reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke mortality. The aMed diet is a modified Med diet, characterized by higher consumption of plant foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, monounsaturated fats compared to saturated fats, and fish, with lower intake of animal products and saturated fats. It also allows for moderate alcohol consumption.\n\nPrevious studies showed that adhering to the Med diet was associated with a lower risk of total and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, and an intervention trial found it more effective than a low-fat diet for weight loss and cholesterol ratio reduction in obese individuals. However, these studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study followed 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without a history of CVD or diabetes from the Nurses' Health Study, involving 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. They assessed an aMed diet score using six self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (FFQs) between 1984 and 2004 to evaluate nutrient intake over the preceding year. Over 95% of nurses maintained participation throughout the 20-year period. FFQs underwent validation, and reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed via medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. Where records were unavailable, cases were classed as “probable” (around 17% of strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts). The study adjusted for factors like body mass index, smoking, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, alcohol intake, and physical activity.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to examine the link between an aMed score and CHD and stroke risk, separately considering fatal and nonfatal types. Greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was linked to a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, they found 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths. Women in the top aMed quintile had a lower risk of both CHD and stroke than those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In 2007, the United States of America was hit by a severe financial crisis. Unemployment surged, the housing market imploded, and many of the nation's largest and most significant corporations were left shattered. This recession continues to this day, so we must ponder the following: how did this crisis occur, and how can we prevent it from happening again? In short, the financial crisis was sparked by self-serving and ignorant political decisions that coerced banks and firms to issue sub-prime loans into an insecure and inadequate financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwrite and repack these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks lacked sufficient capital reserves and passed on the chaos to the repacked mortgages they had sold, and subsequently, to the broader economy.\n\nThe financial crisis’s seeds were sown in 1999 during the Clinton era, as the President sought a second term by boosting his popularity. To achieve this, the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, paving the way for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's largest mortgage underwriter, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate-income people and felt pressure from shareholders to maintain its remarkable growth in profits.” Holmes accurately predicted the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As mentioned earlier, and as Holmes foresaw, imprudent lending would indeed lead to the economy’s collapse.\n\nSeveral factors combined to plunge the economy into chaos, one of which was the novel and intricate structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were extensively used in the years preceding the crisis, further entangling more sectors of the economy in the housing market. This led to U.S. households and financial markets generally becoming excessively exposed to the housing market, making them extremely susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had purchased these mortgage-backed securities were left in ruins. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion dollars in mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a significant discount, Lehman Brothers was dissolved, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were compelled to become commercial banks under intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie held $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. It's that section of your story where you either take flight and astound your readers or send them to sleep and make them hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name. Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her screen when she stumbles into Too Much Information, not even in the fun way. Exposition isn't your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still finds herself in long passages where nothing happens, or worse, too much. Exposition is the little devil on your shoulder whispering to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil urging you to tell every detail of each character's childhood).\n\nExposition means telling your audience what happened, typically in simple prose. In film, it's when one character tells another a core-dump of information, like \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order. As you're reading a story, you're told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to take two pages, with both he and she only getting two lines of dialogue each. You'd expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, showing through his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you'd expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case). A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on. You'd mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you'd expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat. Sometimes it's tempting to rush past certain things. Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and",
            "I caught two broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first, aired live by NBC 4 today (August 13, 2011), reported a man named Shad Hostettler had stabbed his wife in Ashley, Ohio. Her name wasn't mentioned, but they showed his mug shot—he looked downright sinister. They devoted about two minutes to this story, which I believe was appropriate given its ongoing nature. The second story was about an early morning shooting in the Sharon Woods area, critically injuring 18-year-old Travis Buyers. No arrests had been made, and the SWAT team was investigating. This story seemed brief, and I suspect it might have been due to the fact it involved a minority neighborhood. Over the years, I've noticed minorities often receive scant media coverage when they're crime victims. Conversely, if a white child or adult is involved, the media goes into overdrive. Another story focused on a bullet hole in a Med-Flight helicopter, which was determined to be from a .22 caliber rifle shot. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest. Next up was a weather forecast for Saturday's afternoon thunderstorms, with temperatures expected to stay mid- to low-eighties over the weekend. A brief story followed about a Clime Road UDF robbery by a dark-skinned, six-foot tall, 150-pound suspect wearing a hoodie. I found it odd they emphasized his skin color so much. Lastly, a story about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin, was reported. He was sentenced to 300 months (25 years) for conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana to Ohio from Texas. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, which I believed was unnecessary to the story.",
            "There's a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lies a mix of emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers understand each other more than anyone else can, and when they look at their brother, they see a reflection of themselves. This bond is tested during dire situations, revealing the good or evil within. These emotions come with a cost, affecting how we interpret our own actions and their consequences. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers explore this theme and its intense emotions. They journey through a vivid landscape, but bitterness and pride collide in the climax, and only one brother survives.

            "The human brain is quite an intricate and imaginative information-processing system. As technology has evolved from primitive to modern, so have the ways we describe the brain. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, a book, and most recently, a computer. Remember that while these metaphors can be helpful, they also have their limitations and can lead to misconceptions. Information processing begins with data from the sensory organs, which turn physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, or light particles into electrochemical signals. The brain then continually processes this data in both a bottom-up and top-down manner. For instance, when looking at an image of a black box on a white background, the brain combines simple bits of information like color, orientation, and where the edges are to recognize it as a box. Meanwhile, top-down processing can speed up this recognition by using previous decisions to identify it as a black box rather than a hole. Once information is processed, an attention filter determines its importance and directs it to relevant cognitive processes. For example, while walking through a field of grass, you won't notice each blade individually because of a healthy attention filter. However, your brain can pick out your name even in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and attention continually modulates the results. To process information, the brain must first store it. There are different types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. Information is encoded based on its type, such as structurally for written words, phonemically for spoken words, or semantically for their meanings. Working memory, lasting around 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through specific neurons, while long-term memory is thought to be held in certain protein structures. The way knowledge is organized in the brain varies among models, such as those based on human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that concepts are represented by nodes, linked based on their relatedness. For example, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley critiques the impending peril of both technology and the capitalist system that upholds it through the dystopian society depicted in Brave New World. The populace prioritizes collective well-being over individuality and is programmed from birth to seek immediate gratification. The citizens are revealed as pawns in a grand scheme orchestrated by the World Controller, their actions dictated by a single ideology. Analyzing the text through a Marxist lens, one discerns Huxley's mistrust of the developing economic landscape of his era. Key Marxist terms like homogeny and reification underscore the novel's commentary on the flaws in the rising economy. Capitalism is mocked through the concept of false consciousness, where the common people are kept ignorant of their true economic relations, fixated on their own interests. This result is due to the ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, evident through the conditioning of Brave New World's citizens. The lower classes, Delta, Gamma, et al., lack true autonomy; hypnopædia reinforces a drive to consume and indulge, manipulated by the World Controller. Hegemony, where social classes are dominated by a ruling few, is clearly present. The common classes, unaware of their manipulation, 'buy into an ideology that supports the structure' (i.e. capitalism and consumerism). Upper classes, while aware, accept their place, with few exceptions like Bernard. The interactions between social classes, explored in greater detail, reflect the perceived oppression of capitalism. Relationships between individuals do not exist in Brave New World. Characters lack depth, even among major figures, suggesting technology and capitalism strip man of free will and expression. Emotions are kept superficial, as evidenced by male remarks on women's physical appearance and women's casual talk about their encounters. Societal classes' complacency with their hierarchical status reveals the socioeconomic impact of capitalism. Their absolute conformity to their communal roles mirrors Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely empowered by their consumption and obedience to their peers.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for nearly three years now, or roughly four and a half semesters. Like many others, I've found navigating the campus a bit of a hassle. Freshman year, I was assigned to an East Halls dorm, practically the farthest point from the rest of the campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traversing from my home in Stuart Hall to classes like those in the Willard building, situated right in the heart of campus, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially in the often harsh weather conditions of State College. Upon speaking with an alum not much older than myself, I discovered that not too long ago, the East Halls dorms were isolated from the main campus by expansive tracts of unused land. Today, those empty spaces have been transformed into sports fields, new buildings such as the Creamery and the health services center, and are now surrounded by apartments. As our campus continues to grow, getting from one place to another becomes increasingly challenging. What's the best solution to this problem? On a college campus, it's the bicycle. However, bikes alone won't solve the issue; students need to use them, and the campus must be designed with biking in mind.\n\nRecently, I chatted with a friend who had taken up cycling again after a few years. He mentioned that he couldn't believe he ever stopped. “Bikes are fantastic,” he said, “they were uncool for a while, but they're the only way to get around.” Apart from being great for your health, bicycling is the most efficient means of travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a bit of exercise can take you 30 miles or more. Now that I live off campus, as far from the center as some dorms, the wisest decision I made this year was to purchase a bike. My daily class in Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from my home, can be reduced to 5 minutes if I pedal quickly. The only downside is that the most direct route to Thomas, Pollock Road, isn't always the easiest path to cycle on. While walking has its merits, I simply don't have the time to walk. Without my bike, walking would be my only reliable way to get to class. This would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my daily commute, totaling over two and a half hours each week. Add to that the time I'd need to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and other commitments, and that's more time than I can spare."
