            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

The values that I can bring to the social work field include dedication, respect, and an unwavering commitment to improving relationships within families and continuously enhancing my professional competence. These core values aren't merely important for social workers; they are integral to who I am as a person.\n\nMy desire to help others has always been strong, but I was uncertain about the career path to follow. Throughout high school and college, I observed many individuals retreat from their problems in denial or resort to unhealthy coping mechanisms. These experiences guided me towards pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still undecided about my career, I took a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. One summer day, visiting a friend, I met a sixteen-year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. He was there to escape his abusive parents. The following day, I learned he had called the police to his parents’ house. I drove over to assist, explaining my concerns to the police and offering to speak with the parents, who seemed nervous and blamed their son for involving outsiders in disputes. This experience ignited my serious consideration for a career in social work to assist children in resolving family conflicts.\n\nMoreover, social justice is a crucial value in the field of social work. Society often claims the importance of the individual while mourning those lost, yet the concept of individuality we hold is often rooted in archaic traditions rather than uniqueness. If society mourns lost individuals, why do we strive to be similar to \"everyone else\"? I consider myself unique and reject societal limitations. Throughout my academic years, I stood against social injustice by expressing myself through unorthodox hairstyles, unconventional clothing, and piercings, and by actively participating in the GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance) and advocating against racism and discrimination. I remain committed to social justice and will continue to fight against injustice.",
            "This report delves into the Biological and Sociocultural frameworks related to the sleep disorder insomnia. The Biological model emphasizes genetic traits inherited from parents and the medical aspects of health. Meanwhile, the Sociocultural models consider environmental factors and their connections to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia examines these models and discusses the research selected to relate and explain them. The explanations of the research findings are then critiqued, highlighting their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized as primary, secondary, or associated with medical issues or substance intake. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, while secondary ones relate to mental disorders. Other categories involve medical complications or substance use. Dyssomnias include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia is characterized by trouble initiating or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is difficulty staying awake for at least a month. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/or automatic REM. Dyssomnias focus on sleep initiation and maintenance, whereas Parasomnias involve behavioral abnormalities and/or physiological occurrences, such as Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders related to mental disorders are linked to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review primarily focuses on insomnia and primary sleep disorders in relation to the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders explores genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired components. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice found that GABAB receptors on orexin neurons control sleep/wake states. Activating the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, and inhibiting it can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. GABAB agonists like baclofen increase sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). These mouse models indicate that genetic and environmental factors influence human sleep, possibly altering the GABAB receptor's function. This could affect sleep quality, impacting daily activities such as school, career, and monotonous tasks.",
            "This paper delves into three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), often called Auditory Processing Disorder (APD). It begins with a quick definition of the disorder, then moves on to diagnosis, highlighting common characteristics, or “red flags”. Lastly, it provides strategies for teachers in mainstream classrooms to help students with CAPD.\n\n\tCAPD, or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is defined as the efficiency and effectiveness with which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. To break it down, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies it. In simpler terms, it explains that the brain struggles to properly process sounds heard. People with CAPD can hear normally but have difficulty separating words or distinguishing conversation from background noise. It's not a hearing impairment but a brain function issue.\n\n\tThe earliest mention of this disorder dates back to the mid-1950s, referred to as “auditory imperception”. Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari started developing tests for children with communicative disorders in 1954. In 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception. The disorder gained more attention at a national conference held in 1977, which sparked research on children with CAPD.\n\n\tCAPD can manifest in various ways: individuals may struggle to localize or hear sounds in space, discriminate between sounds, recognize sound patterns, differentiate changes in speech, have sound synthesis difficulties, or determine the sequence of auditory information. No one tool or test consistently diagnoses CAPD, and its cause remains unknown. Diagnosis involves systematic observation of listening behavior and performance on tests of auditory function, conducted by audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others. Common tests present patients with multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli and ask for them to differentiate items like words or numbers. Advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals in the ear and measuring responses.",
            "The play \"Twelfth Night\" seems to assert that while disguise can be quite handy for deceiving others over extended periods, it's ultimately crucial to discard that new persona to prevent losing oneself forever. The challenge lies in ending such deception, as it might leave one feeling isolated. One must then choose between safeguarding their personal identity or maintaining relationships with others. While some may remain indifferent upon discovering a deception, others might find it repulsive and be offended by the entire charade.\n\nThe theme of deception in gender role reversal is quite complex, as it raises several questions. For instance, why does the individual feel compelled to forsake their own identity and adopt a disguise as the opposite gender? In Viola's case, it's clear she would rather protect herself from potential harm: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249) Arriving in an unfamiliar land, Viola dons a male disguise to shield herself from potential attackers. Her plan succeeds, yet it also isolates her from female company, disconnecting her from a vital support system. Worse still, her convincing portrayal of a man leads Olivia to mistake her for Sebastian and fall in love with her: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) Additionally, she must grapple with repressed romantic feelings towards Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\n\nToday’s readers might see \"Twelfth Night\" as an example of how deception can help uncover suppressed emotions, particularly in Olivia and Orsino's cases. Some passages hint that these characters may harbor unspoken desires that Viola/Cesario’s appearance forces them to confront. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because he appears to be a man, or does she secretly harbor feelings for females? It seems unlikely, as Shakespeare’s character Olivia appears more likely to be mocking the societal norms of his time, who judged others solely based on their appearance, as seen by the ease with which she shifts her affections from Cesario to Sebastian and considers Cesario/Viola as family: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)",
            "The German colonial rule's cruelty, particularly the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa, has been well-documented. However, it's inaccurate to label the entire colonial empire with a single description, as policies and governance varied greatly among colonies. Educational provision also differed significantly. When the British took over German East Africa, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also commended by contemporary authors. The situation in South West Africa was starkly different. Unlike East Africa, where the government played a significant role in educating natives through state schools, in South West Africa, the task was largely left to missionary societies with limited government backing. The government did invest heavily in European education, establishing state schools and supporting missionary schools. These policies had lasting effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies had many literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergent experience. This paper aims to explore these factors, focusing on new research into the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\nThere is extensive literature on education in the German colonial empire, much written in German and produced during or shortly after the colonial period. Early works primarily described the educational systems of these colonies. Later English works expanded on the discourse through comparative studies and detailed analyses. These studies highlighted significant differences across colonial educational systems. Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa is particularly relevant to this paper. He compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that explain their differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa is a significant factor in shaping the colony's educational system.\nSouth West Africa boasted a moderately temperate climate, with much of the territory covered by arid desert. This relatively hospitable environment led to a moderate European population. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, compared to just 5,336 in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "The classification of Popular Music has expanded over the past 100 years, encompassing so many genres that it's tough to list them all. To make matters more complex, nearly every genre—rap, rock, country, jazz, folk—has grown into numerous sub and sub-sub genres. Within the realm of Heavy Metal rock, this diversification has made it one of the most expressive and varied genres in popular music over the last 40 years. It's expressive due to its wide range of emotions, often leaning toward the dark side. It's diverse as well, as soon after its inception, musicians realized its flexibility and began creating their own sub-genres, followed by sub-sub-genres, continuing to this day.\n\nThe heavy metal scene has blossomed into a vast array of niches, making it hard to pin down what exactly qualifies as heavy metal. It has absorbed themes from various genres, but it all stems from a common origin. To truly grasp the metal music prevalent today, one must first understand the essence of the metal movement and why it's more than just a genre.\n\nMetal is, in many ways, a movement defined by darkness. It's a \"music of more\" — more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality, and less primitivism. Metal bands are known for their technical prowess, which shines through in their music. It's also a movement heavily influenced by drug use. The mid-70s psychedelic drug boom led to crazier and otherworldly records, using drugs as inspiration. This genre possesses dark, visceral qualities, a stark contrast to the lighter emotional tones in much of popular music. Later generations of metal musicians have drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral qualities of the Romantic Era. Lyrics like this from Helter Skelter by The Beatles exemplify this darkness and are considered one of the first heavy metal songs. The Beatles wrote it in response to a Rolling Stones song, aiming to prove they could be as heavy as their rivals. The song appeared on The White Album",
            "A few decades before the Surrealists started their dreamlike artwork, Henri Rousseau was already crafting his dreams, both literally and metaphorically. His famous 1910 painting, The Dream, doesn't just depict a woman in awe of the land in her dream; it also reflects Rousseau's personal dreams and aspirations as an artist. Rousseau longed for recognition, acceptance, and praise from other artists and art lovers, but faced an internal struggle: to conform to or mimic certain styles to gain acceptance or to forge his own unique path. The Dream is a prime example of this career-long dilemma.\n\nTo fully understand The Dream, you should know a bit about Rousseau's life. Born in Laval, northwest France, on May 21, 1844, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer who enjoyed a comfortable life. He had no formal art training and worked as a gabelou (municipal toll service employee), earning the nickname douanier (customs inspector). After the deaths of his wife and eight infant children, Rousseau turned to painting for solace and a new start. Unlike his contemporaries who romanticized the peasant in painting, Rousseau was a folk painter, representing the hopes and dreams of the average person.\n\nRousseau's desire for acceptance by the art world is understandable given his context: he was untrained, began painting late in life, and worked alongside many renowned artists. Recognition for his art came around the same time Matisse was gaining fame. Jan Gordon, in Modern French Painters, notes that while Matisse feared painting tritely and Rousseau desired conventionality to gain admission to the Artiste Français, their styles, subjects, and motivations differed greatly.",
            "Numerous wise individuals have pondered the deep connection between ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. I hold that at the core, there's a reason for this. As John Keats suggests in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While much of what we learn in life is through education or experience, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics without formal teaching. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe rather than dictate. Our studies of morality and beauty strive to explain why something is beautiful or moral, rather than providing rules for what is good art or moral behavior. Criticism of art or morals can't fully capture the essence of what is good or beautiful; it often ends with phrases like, \"There's just something about it,\" preceding a deeper explanation. I believe that both art and morals can't be fully reduced to their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor notes, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" In the same way, ethics has a transcendent quality, as Ludwig Wittgenstein says, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental.\" This ineffable \"something\" is the most powerful attribute of both ethics and aesthetics, linking them. I think morality and art are closely related because they impact us at a noumenal level, using a Kantian term—an experience that can be felt but not fully explained. This link is even stronger with literary art. As McKean points out, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Today's Germany is a powerful, united nation with a rich culture that spans from the hidden mountains of München up to the Baltic Sea's shore in Kiel. This cultural tapestry is also felt in cities like Köln along the Rhine, across the heart of Germany, and in the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. Given its diverse origins, it's no surprise that modern Germany is a blend of various tribes and sources.\n\nThe land known as Germania was once the ancestral home of the Germans. The etymology of the name is debated among scholars. Some argue it came from the Tungrian tribe, who were referred to as Germans before crossing the Rhine to clash with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Others suggest the name originates from the spear used in warfare, the \"ger,\" or from the Old Irish word \"garim\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans' loud nature. The earliest known use of the term \"Germanus\" was by Julius Caesar in his accounts of the Gallic Wars, where he distinguished the Germanic tribes from the Gauls (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC).\n\nThe first-century Roman historian Tacitus described the Germanic peoples as indigenous, not intermixed with other races. They had migrated to Germania by sea, not by land, drawn by its wild landscapes and inclement climate (Tacitus, 98). The Romans, while expanding their empire, often traded with and recruited Germanic tribes for their skilled warriors. However, the Romans rarely settled in Germania, preferring to return to their empire. As a result, many Germanic tribes lived on the empire's fringes, trading their goods and skills with the Romans (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).",
            "I stood, my mind a blank slate, as I stared at the scene before me. Unfeeling and detached, my consciousness, acutely aware of the image but not connecting it to any abstract thought, studied the picture at hand. Ideas darted in and out of my mind like a game of ping-pong, so swiftly and smoothly that it seemed I had no personal thoughts, only an active experience of what I was seeing. I had always wanted to draw, ever since I was a child, and a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" promised to teach me everything from recognizing a pencil to understanding how the brain interprets lines. The book advised placing a square frame around any picture to simplify it. At that moment, though, I was too overwhelmed to create that frame. I could only stand there, awestruck. Picasso's blue phase, Monet's love for greenery, and the Italian Renaissance masters' vibrant colors were overwhelming. I felt like I was at the beginning of my art journey, my first work, \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy fingers reached for my chosen tool, muscles tensing and relaxing as my hand moved through the air. My thoughts gave shape and form to the moment, a moment that could have been the most creative of my life. Water swirled, clear and calm. Pieces broke away and were lost in the process. My hand hit the toilet handle again, harder this time, but the offending brown package refused to budge, stuck like a slug. A few more flushes later, I found myself holding the toilet paper roll, wrapped around my hand like an oven mitt. I stood tall, then bent at the waist, my hand slowly dipping into the bowl, like a mother reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey....",
            "Teens are perishing behind the wheel, and it's a deadly combination of factors that's causing these grim statistics. The teen brain just isn't ready for the road's dangers, and inexperience amplifies this problem, leading to more fatal crashes, vehicle rollovers, speeding, and road deviations. Moreover, teens tend to drive with peers, which, as any sensible person knows, they do regularly. A study from the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center found a direct link between the age of passengers and the occurrence of traffic accidents.\n\nIn an effort to improve teen driving safety, several states have implemented provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and prohibit other minors as passengers. However, these are merely temporary solutions. The real issue is that, as a group, young drivers are not equipped to handle the risks and responsibilities of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman argues that 18 is still too young for a regular driver's license. USA Today reports that Zuckerman's research indicates a common desire among those under 19-20 to take risks for the thrill, which makes delaying driving until this tendency subsides a logical decision. If we continue to license young teens to drive, we'll see deadly accidents continue and the death toll may skyrocket in the coming years. By 2010, the Baby Boom generation's children will be eligible to drive, and millions of new teen drivers will hit the road.\n\nLegislation to address this issue could be simple. Schools could offer driver's education classes to start the learning process, but no one under 18 could operate a motor vehicle. Provisional permits could still be issued before a full driver's license, with a set number of practical driver's training hours required. The specific number of hours could be based on the majority of states' requirements (in California, it's 6 hours behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours with an adult). Since teen driving fatalities affect all states, uniform, national legislation would be a sensible and effective way to protect teens across the country.\n\nThe legislation I propose is not a novel idea.",
            "While sifting through the Library of Congress’s archive of early Edison films, I decided to take a look at all the trick films, totaling fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films often use clever editing to create illusions. My analysis mainly focused on the poetic elements of most trick films and identified some unique characteristics in a few of the later ones. Most trick films from this era are confined to a stationary stage, using a frontal proscenium, without camera movement, and relying on long and medium shots. They follow the one shot = one film method closely.\n\nOne striking similarity among these trick films is that they are shot within a static interior set, with the camera remaining fixed in its position, mirroring the stage or vaudeville tradition. This immobility often restricts actors to side-to-side movements without approaching or retreating from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors move back and forth horizontally, but the camera does not follow them.\n\nLong shots and, less frequently, medium shots are the norm, with close-ups being absent from all Edison trick films. This approach mimics early theatre and vaudeville practices, where the entire performance was visible within the stage's frame. Actors do not move towards the camera, making close-ups unnecessary.\n\nMany early trick films adhere to the one conceptual shot = one film rule, which limits their length to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second. This also restricts their narrative or dramatic content to brief vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic or disappearing acts. However, a single conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes can consist of multiple joined physical shots to create illusions. For example, in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a closer inspection reveals that the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” starts at a specific point, but the entire film is perceived as one continuous shot by viewers.",
            "John Taylor, hailing from Caroline, was an early and passionate advocate for the Republican cause. His background as an agriculturalist and brief political career instilled in him a steadfast commitment to personal liberties and government policies. His agricultural roots deeply influenced his views on government, making him a vocal champion of an agrarian society. The preservation and promotion of this superior career drove his arguments on sovereignty, constitutionalism, and the judicial system.",
            "Looking back at Figure 17, there was a steep decline in commuter log submissions during the third month of the project, which was quite disheartening. The reasons for this aren't entirely clear, but it could be attributed to the approach of winter in a New England campus, leading to a drop in bicycle and foot commuters. Additionally, December marks the end of the fall semester and the busy period of finishing schoolwork and processing grades, which might have caused log submissions to slip people's minds. The holidays also bring a month-long break for students and faculty, further reducing the need to commute to campus. Classes resume in late January, which may also explain the low number of logs for that month. It's worth noting that any project like this often experiences an initial burst of enthusiasm that may naturally wane over time. To counteract this, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which indeed led to an increase in log submissions for that month. One of the challenges we faced was maintaining project momentum despite natural declines in engagement and the impact of holiday and semester breaks on higher education. Another significant challenge was the cultural preference for driving cars, which provides freedom, independence, and flexibility. To incentivize alternative commuting methods, we offered various prizes such as gift certificates for local restaurants, coffee shops, a massage therapist, the local independent bookstore, and even some national chain stores. While the gift cards were sufficient at the project's start, offering larger prizes like bicycles, hybrid cars, or electric cars might have boosted participation and engagement. Increasing the value of prizes over time, perhaps announcing more substantial ones like a bicycle in December and a hybrid or electric car in January, could have potentially increased participation.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a financial tool that mimics an index, commodity, or a mix of assets, trading like a stock on an exchange. An ETF offers both the diversification of an index fund and the perks of single stock ownership, like short-selling, margin trading, and buying fractional shares. These advantages are compelling, but ETFs generally come with a lower expense ratio compared to mutual funds. However, there are drawbacks, such as trading commissions, similar to stock orders. Plus, ETFs provide a wide range of options. Yet, it's crucial for savvy investors to assess whether the stated benefits, like diversification, are real and to what extent. For this analysis, we'll examine the ETF IHF and compare its top 10 holdings to determine if owning a single ETF approximates the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks, and if there are better ways to configure these stocks for a better risk-return trade-off.\n\nTo manage the scope, we'll focus on the top 10 holdings, which hold 63.58% of the ETF's assets. Here's the list:\n\nTo gauge how well these top 10 stocks represent the ETF IHF, we'll calculate their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return, using their current asset percentages normalized to 100%. The results are shown below:\n\nThe chart reveals that a portfolio of just these top 10 holdings yields a 6.11% higher return and a 0.12 lower Beta than the ETF. This suggests that a portfolio of the top 10 holdings could offer higher returns and lower risk. However, these portfolios might not be statistically different from each other.\n\nTo confirm whether these portfolios are indeed different, we'll calculate the standard deviation of each top 10 stock and normalize it to 100% to compare their combined standard deviation with the ETF IHF's standard deviation.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe's \"Dream-Land\" is often hailed as one of his better poems. In this piece, Poe employs the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, a reference traced back to Virgil. Originally used by the Greeks to denote an island north of Britain, Thulé was considered the edge of the known world. While it's clear that Virgil utilized this term, a more contemporary source also merits consideration—Poe's affinity for German authors. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" notes the similarities between Poe's and Goethe's poems, concluding that Poe was indeed imitating Goethe.\n\nGoethe, a renowned German writer, is celebrated for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts: the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Goethe's death, 1832. Within the second part, a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé\" tells the story of a king who, after his wife's death, begins to drink heavily and eventually takes his own life. The parallels between the King of Thule and the speaker in \"Dream-Land\" are striking, particularly in their shared sense of loss and despair. A romantic drama adaptation of Faust by H.P. Grattan was published in 1842, just months before Poe's use of the term \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe references Thule twice in his collected works. In \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" he refers to \"ultma Thule,\" while in \"Dream-Land,\" he uses the term as bookends for the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes the landscape of Thule as dark, lonely, and haunted by the ghosts of his dead friends, mirroring the melancholic and bereft state of the King of Thule. The poem suggests that the speaker has stepped into Goethe's work.\n\nGoethe's influence on Poe is significant. Poe may have encountered Goethe's works through his admiration for Tennyson or through the numerous reproductions circulating after the original publications.",
            "Under California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\nA judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim outright. To justify punitive damages, a plaintiff must prove the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for probable harm, as well as demonstrating that the conduct was reprehensible. Palmer could argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill given multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping before her accident, yet he still neglected to clean it. While her claim about Martin’s actions being despicable is less forceful, it remains reasonable given the six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009 and Martin’s continued inaction to ensure store safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, informed his manager, Paul Martin, of an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin replied he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Mr. Martin about the spill. Martin responded similarly. At 5:30 pm on that day, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Before Palmer’s accident, five different slip-and-fall incidents had occurred at D&D’s in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering filing a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of a non-contractual obligation if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud, or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct intending to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have deemed conduct malicious when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "I took an Islam course at CBC four years ago, and the discussion on whether Islam is hostile was heated. This question is more pertinent today. The media's view of Islam and extremists shifted drastically after 9/11, from hostile to extremely tolerant, making it hard to imagine a president like Barack Obama, whose family has an obvious Muslim background. The Prophet Muhammad's biography intrigues me because it portrays him as a martyr, misunderstood and humble, rather than a conqueror who forced converts. This portrayal seems to overshadow the life of Jesus Christ and even implies that Muhammad was a sort of substitute. The biography also often presents 'witness' stories heard from third parties, which diminishes their credibility. I find it most concerning that the biography elevates Muhammad to an almost godly figure, contradicting historical accounts of his rise to power.",
            "The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were quickly abandoned in the evolution of Christian thought following his life. As we examine this history in broad terms, a pattern emerges where Christianity diverged further and further from its roots. The modern world seems to be increasingly aware and progressive. While traditionalists remain, their influence may not be sufficient to shape the whole. Among Christians, a historical consciousness will surely grow in the coming years. A desire will arise to distinguish the doctrines added to Christianity over time from Jesus' original intent. Though it may take decades or centuries, the outcome is unstoppable: Christianity will reverse its historical trend, returning to its original form. A movement will develop, peeling away layers of doctrine one by one, as if the clock were turning backward, leaving only the essence of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other philosophers made such claims. When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, encouraging millions to worship as they did in Jesus' time, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to guide the way. However, as the theological clock moves backward, the diverse proliferation of beliefs in Christendom will reverse into uniformity. Between regions, denominations, and divisions of every kind, we will see increasing similarities instead of differences. History is filled with such reversals. Consider how Christians were once persecuted, shunned, and killed by the Roman Empire, only to later have that empire become Christian. Our country has progressed from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The coming great reversal in Christian history will unfold, undoing history in search of its source and reversing diversity in the process. An important factor in making this possible will be interpreting Jesus' words metaphorically, not literally. So, what transpired since Jesus' lifetime?\n\nIf we delve deeply into history, we find only Judaism as the theological origin of Christianity. Monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were central to the religion by the time the Romans conquered Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population was not united in spirit. They split into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the majority of common people.",
            "I reckon The Jungle demonstrates that people, deep down, are inherently selfish and self-serving. They strive to make their lives the best they can without concerning themselves with those less fortunate. The novel underscores this through the owners and managers of the colossal factories. Their sole aim is to expand their empires, disregarding any obstacle, whether it's people or creatures, that might impede their progress. As Upton Sinclair writes, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This vivid imagery conveys the immense damage the pollution is causing, while highlighting the owners' callous disregard for anyone or anything harmed by their pursuits. They couldn't care less about the suffocating smoke pouring from the factories or the waste from the countless pens around Packingtown. Their apathy extends to their employees, whom they exploit mercilessly to increase profits. \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They subject workers to grueling hours and summarily dismiss them without compensation or job assistance, all while safety regulations were virtually nonexistent. Consequently, the hardships faced by those who perished in Packingtown were accepted as the norm, with no recourse or assistance available. Unions, intended to aid the workers, often ended up exploiting them further. The workers found themselves trapped in a system akin to slavery, forced into terrible living and working conditions, with no way out. As Sinclair eloquently puts it, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Many creators employ various methods to evoke specific feelings or attitudes in their readers towards significant themes. Some of these strategies are more potent than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes numerous techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald combines an adjective with a noun in an unconventional way to create a certain ambiance around a subject. Other times, he assigns meaning to a symbol and then employs it for the same purpose. Fitzgerald employs this latter technique with several colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In his novel, Fitzgerald builds up connotations for these colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, which he later uses to evoke feelings around important objects.\n\nFitzgerald assigns a meaning to white/gray, with white representing a higher class and gray symbolizing age and fadedness. He establishes this meaning early in the novel through repeated references to both colors. Daisy and Jordan are consistently \"in white\" (8), with everyone else wearing white, such as Nick in \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby's party, Tom in a \"white shirt\" (36) during his meeting with Myrtle, and Catherine in \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only deviation is when Nick observes Gatsby's party: \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further reinforces these colors by assigning them to mundane subjects: Nick's commute takes him \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the names of guests at Gatsby's parties are \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's schedule, Catherine's apartment is a \"slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses,\" and plain or common people and places are described as white or gray, such as Jordan and Daisy's \"white girlhood\" (19) together, the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"gray Italian child\" on the train (26), and the dog-seller, a \"gray old man\" (27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald infuses white/gray with sufficient meaning, he uses these colors to signify insignificance or uniformity around certain subjects. This technique begins with Daisy. After a prolonged absence of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster,\" making her seem less of a character and more like a uniform addition, something Gatsby desires and yearns for (74). Fitzgerald continues this technique around Daisy to convey her uniformity, such as the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18), and her appearance in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",

            "Culture, in many ways, shapes and dictates the dynamics of any negotiation. It's a complex tapestry woven with threads of shared beliefs, traditions, and behaviors that can vary widely between and even within groups. A culture is not merely a homogenous entity; it's a multifaceted entity that can be understood just as much by what it is not as by what it is. Generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" oversimplify cultural nuances and can be misleading. While broad generalizations about a culture can be useful, a successful negotiator must understand the specific cultural context and how it influences the negotiation process.\n\nWhen engaging with a foreign culture, one often compares it to their own, leading to inevitable comparisons. This understanding can be gained through studying its history, customs, and even its biases. Instead of attempting to change or judge a culture, a negotiator should accept it for what it is and navigate it, especially when they hold a weaker position at the table. Respect for local traditions and beliefs can help in overcoming cultural barriers and advancing negotiations.\n\nIt's also crucial to recognize that culture isn't confined to national borders. Companies within the same nation can have distinct corporate cultures. For instance, one company might prioritize long working hours while another prefers a more flexible schedule. Signs of corporate culture can be seen in employee attire, communication styles (direct versus indirect), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy from employees, while others restrict it to approved causes. These differences can be as pronounced within the United States as they are across different regions and urban/suburban environments.\n\nValues are especially important to understand as they provide the 'why' behind a culture. If a culture values 'saving face' or 'communal harmony,' a negotiator will be cautious about publicly shaming an opponent to secure a deal. Similarly, if a culture values a hard-driven bargain, negotiations might be more tenacious. Knowing these values beforehand can significantly impact a negotiator's approach. However, understanding the personal background of the opposing negotiator can further enhance the effectiveness of the negotiation.",
            "The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’ This sentiment is first seen in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and is the foundation for St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. Similarly, this view is held by another author, Thomas Aquinas, who also defends this belief. Given our task is to compare these arguments, we must, for simplicity, assume they are both correct in their belief in God, specifically the God of the Bible. To contrast, we would not be able to compare their arguments effectively if we included a different type of God.\n\nWhile both authors present valid points, neither truly offers a comprehensive basis for belief in God. We will first examine St. Anselm’s argument. Anselm suggests that understanding God lies within one’s own mind, and that the proof for God is found by examining what we inherently know to be true. He implies that external evidence is unnecessary for this proof, which is often referred to as faith.\n\nThomas Aquinas, on the other hand, argues that God’s existence can be proven through reason and empirical evidence, negating the need for faith. This approach is beneficial for evangelism as it allows for logical persuasion of new converts without relying on their willingness to accept unprovable truths. Aquinas presents five logical arguments: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument demonstrates that the proof of God exists in the logical necessity of God.",
            "Around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince, who would later be known as Buddha, was born. Throughout his life, he abandoned the world and attained enlightenment, leading to the creation of Buddhism, with the most conservative branch being Theravada Buddhism. This religion emerged about 2500 years ago and has evolved significantly over time. For example, in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laypeople alike participate, though Buddha never taught about such a festival. These changes span from superficial traditions to the heart of the religion itself. Over time, the Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic and lay perspectives, has modified its core beliefs due to various internal and external factors, some hostile and others benign.\n\nSome key terms we'll use often include internal versus external forces. Internal forces are those originating from within the Buddhist community, regardless of monastic status. External forces are from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that harm or intend to harm the Buddhist community, often driven by a negative view of Buddhism. Benign forces do not intend to harm or help the community, but may still do so. These terms will appear frequently in this discussion.\n\nFirst, let's explore the basics of the religion—its core doctrines. Buddhists find refuge in the Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is composed of the Tripitaka, the three baskets of Buddhist scripture. The Sutta Pitaka includes all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines rules for conduct, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka covers the religion's metaphysical aspects. Key metaphysical concepts include Anatta (no-self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these concepts allows one to escape Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth. Along with this, lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) will cease when one becomes enlightened. The Vinaya Pitaka provides rules for laypeople and monks. Laypeople follow five key precepts: I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not engage in sexual misconduct, and I shall not consume intoxicating substances. Monks have many more rules to adhere to. The core doctrinal notion is the Four Noble Truths: First, that life is full of suffering (Dukkha). Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States of America and Mexico once shared a longstanding rivalry that lasted 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145). The height of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States successfully defeated Mexico and gained Texas and the American Southwest as new territories. There were numerous other skirmishes between the two nations, with tensions easing before the First World War.\n\nThis is not unique to the United States and Mexico. Many neighboring nations face similar rivalries due to shared borders. David M. Pletcher (1977) points out that \"only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting, overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Both Mexico and Cuba are geographically close to the United States and have historically been rivals, unlike other Latin American nations which have maintained good relations.\n\nReligious differences were a significant source of tension, a problem many nations have faced throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) notes that in the 18th and 19th centuries, Americans opposed Catholicism and monarchy, similar to the ideological struggles of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union (p.86). This distrust was inherited from the English and Spanish colonial rulers, making amiable foreign relations difficult to establish.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes during this 57-year period. Most of these involved territorial issues, including border raids from Mexican territory and other frontier problems. Bandits and outlaws from American border towns were a significant issue until both countries exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) explains that the rivalry began to ease as Mexico became significantly dependent on the United States and finally ended as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico in the later part of the 19th century (p. 109-110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, I found myself unexpectedly disabled by an ailment I had never heard of. As a nurse at the time, I had chosen my profession to find the security I lacked as a child. \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick\" was the mantra I repeated to myself. Despite my dream to be a scientist or journalist, perhaps a bit of both, I chose nursing. Now, here I am—46, single, with no savings and unable to work. I've been living on Social Security Disability for 15 years, and now I have nothing left to call my own. Every day is a struggle, an assault on my security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing is certain anymore, yet there is one truth: I couldn't have survived these years without my family and a few kind friends. When disaster strikes, no matter how strong you are, you don't feel strong at all.\n\nLife is full of emergencies, big and small. No matter how well-prepared, some are too big to handle alone. We in the U.S. should stop relying solely on big government. Instead, we should learn to trust and help each other. The Conservatives talk about rugged individualism, but our forefathers' success was built on compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources. Pioneers crossing the Rockies didn't make it alone.\n\nBe prepared, I am. I have a disaster kit, first aid, water purification, plastic sheeting, duct tape, flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, and canned goods. If you have the resources and land for a small farm, and can preserve your food, do it. But also, get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do? Are there constraints that guide the course of evolutionary change? While D'Arcy Thompson, in 1917, mused that \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" this sentiment still holds true today. Recent studies have applied mathematical modeling to various aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis, both ontogenetically and phylogenetically (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our investigation explores how combining mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, along with experimental studies, can elucidate the mechanisms driving evolutionary-developmental shifts. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters, which were then modeled using the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We created hypothetical shell morphologies to interpret the limits of possible morphological changes in Prunum. These results are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to better understand macroevolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a tube that evolves through 360 degrees of space over time. These 360-degree turns are called whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis known as the columella. This columella runs through the central column of the shell. The rate at which whorls enlarge can vary, with a continuous line separating each whorl called a suture. Typically, the largest whorl of a shell is the last one, referred to as the body whorl. The spire is all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire, while the base is the opposite end. The animal exits its shell through an opening known as the aperture.\n\nShells can be examined from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. The \"usual\" orientation is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.\n\nTo count whorls, first view the shell from the apical perspective and determine where the first suture begins. Draw a line dividing the shell into two parts, then count the whorls from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures that evolve through time and space as the animal builds its shell. The trajectory of the aperture can be tracked using the coordinates of each whorl's aperture center, as well as its horizontal and vertical radius.\n\nThis trajectory can be represented graphically and mathematically. Once a mathematical formulation is established, parameters can be varied and modified to alter the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "The neonatal and infant mortality rates in Indonesia have not seen significant improvement over the past decade. Despite the country's progress towards several Millennium Development Goals, including water and sanitation targets, the progress in child and maternal health lags behind the 2015 goal. Reasons for this include inefficiencies in healthcare delivery and access issues. Indonesia has made strides in the number of births attended by skilled workers, with 72% meeting this target, but it includes traditional workers like midwives who lack medical intervention capabilities, which contributes to high maternal death rates. Additionally, there has been a decline in professional treatment of diarrhea cases in children under five, and postnatal care remains a concern with low rates nationwide. C-section rates remain low, at 4%, with urban rates at 7% and rural at 2%, highlighting healthcare disparities. There is also a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, indicating that the poor struggle more with healthcare access due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nIn considering how to address these issues, the primary question is whether Indonesia should focus on program-specific solutions or strengthen its overall healthcare system. While targeted programmatic approaches can yield faster results and have clear objectives, they may divert resources from other areas and lead to duplicated, uncoordinated services. For instance, heavy investment in HIV/AIDS programming has negatively impacted family planning efforts. Therefore, a balanced approach that addresses both the immediate challenges and the broader healthcare system is likely necessary.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their meticulous attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the era. Yet, two notable exceptions are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, which break from this mold with their mysterious elements and unique flair. Both works reveal the characters' inner selves, their pains, and their true nature, through these mysterious aspects, which are often depicted through dream sequences or dreamlike states. For instance, in Oliver Twist, such occurrences unveil insights into Oliver's inner turmoil, his awareness of his surroundings, and his lack of control over his fate. When Oliver relives the shooting vividly in chapter 28, it is as if he is in a dream, highlighting his inability to influence the events unfolding around him. The shooting is depicted as overwhelming, numbing his senses and leaving him with constant, dreadful pain linked to fear, rather than surprise. This dreamlike scene underscores Oliver's helplessness and the growing sense of defeat that he has been forced to accept, perhaps by the influence of Fagin. This reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over his own destiny. The passage also hints at a deeper mystery, raising questions about who or what caused his misfortune, as it was clearly not his own doing. This sequence emphasizes Oliver's inability to regain control of his life, even when it is on the line.",
            "A couple of years ago, I was working in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to assist them in their subjects, but my strengths were in English and reading. A fellow instructor recruited me to help a young boy named Adrian, who was having trouble reading. It was clear that something was off; he could pronounce some letters correctly, while others he got completely wrong, which was puzzling. Adrian was of Latino descent and spoke perfect English, but his reading was a struggle. We kept working on it until I met his mother during a babysitting session. She didn't speak a word of English, only Spanish. Despite my limited Spanish, we managed to communicate. It dawned on me then: Adrian could read fine, he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I'm not sure if my realization helped him much, but I hope he's doing better now. I share this story to highlight the language barrier in schools, especially in California, and to illustrate that it's not always as apparent as we think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English, reading can still be challenging. The problem is widespread, so what can we do? In Adrian's case, the solution was straightforward: tutoring in English reading, particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. However, for many children who barely speak English, the solution is much more complex. There's no single answer. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes—none of these alone will solve the problem. The key is to combine all these methods!",
            "From our childhood, many of us are taught that there's something greater than ourselves, something we can't grasp. Some of us are brought to Sunday school, while others visit temples or search within ourselves for understanding. Some readily accept the beliefs passed down by our parents, while others reject them, denying there's anything beyond our self-centered universe. We may switch our values over time, but whatever path we take, we seek to define ourselves through our unique spiritual views. We search for a guiding light in the darkness to bring us into the sun.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said, when I asked for his favorite bird. We were on the porch, watching the rain smash against the tin roof as we smoked. The gutters sent the rain down, drowning the plants near us. He stared into the rain, a mix of searching and remembering. He'd grown thin, his clothes loose, hair sparse. He avoided my gaze. I felt alone, afraid, unable to discuss his passing. I hugged him, sat back, moved closer, and joined him in watching the rain fall. My father passed in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. Chemo and radiation prolonged his suffering, but only by a few months. I couldn't watch him leave this life. I chose to remember him by how he lived, not how he died. I curled up in my bed for three days, waiting for news. No one called.",
            "The classic \"Gothic Novel,\" as Ian Watt puts it in \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel,\" is an 'oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" blending the old and the new in both form and substance. The Gothic genre has been both celebrated and critiqued, praised for its 'terrible sublime' and lambasted for lacking depth (Burke). Walpole's \"The Castle of Otranto\" pioneered the Gothic genre by fusing older theatrical elements and modern literary techniques. It presented a new kind of storytelling that combined the 'old' and the 'new,' idealizing the past while offering a fresh perspective. The term 'Gothic' was used for different peoples, styles, and time periods, often seen as archaic or unsophisticated compared to the 'modern' advancements of literature and society. The Gothic's enduring appeal lies in its unique blend of theatricality and the novel's personal character exploration. Chivalry, a medieval concept, is a key theme in Gothic novels like \"The Castle of Otranto,\" embodying the ideal of a brave, honorable knight. Walpole, writing during a politically fraught time, may have seen a loss of the moral 'goodness' and innate 'goodness' represented by chivalry in his contemporary society. This is seen clearly in characters like Frederic, who exemplifies chivalric traits and is a romanticized ideal of a knight. Walpole's description of Frederic as a prince who has suffered tragedy and is assumed dead by infidels embodies this trope, with his gallant and courteous nature exaggerated to fit the Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management refers to the sequence of processes that move goods from the point of customer order through raw materials, production, distribution, and finally to the customer. This concept was coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who described it as a comprehensive process for planning, implementing, and controlling the supply chain to meet customer needs swiftly and efficiently. There are six pivotal components to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers leverage these components to deliver exceptional customer service.",
            "Adolf Hitler, it seems, is alive and well in Burma, according to a sign held by Ellen Page, the star of Juno. Burma, or Myanmar as it's known, is a Southeast Asian country under the grip of a ruthless military junta that seized power through a coup in 1962. In 2007, a series of street protests, dubbed the \"Saffron Revolution,\" erupted, led by monks. The protests initially saw peaceful gatherings, but escalated into violence as the military responded with force, invading monasteries and imprisoning foreign journalists, including a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai who was killed during a protest. Estimates of the death toll range from 13 to several thousand. This is not an isolated incident; throughout history, many regimes have sought to quash dissent and maintain total control. Egyptian pharaohs, Japanese emperors, and even our current president, George W. Bush, have been accused of such actions. Notable examples include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, the Rwandan genocide, and Adolf Hitler's 'Third Reich'.",
            "Duke Ellington’s influence on jazz can be attributed to his longevity and the way he crafted his orchestra. His piano presence is often subtle, but as a composer, Ellington excelled, writing intricate pieces that highlighted individual band members' skills. He created a framework for soloists to improvise freely, while also writing tightly orchestrated sections and phrases tailored to each player's unique style. This approach allowed him to emphasize the overall tone of the orchestra, creating cohesive and original sounds for each piece. Ellington’s ability to master individual players' sounds and how they worked together in a growing ensemble led to some of the most innovative and brilliant works in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music Dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative use of voice as an instrument. This is evident in Creole Love Call, where voice and reeds engage in a call and response, showcasing Ellington's talent for adding texture and color. The piece features a series of choruses, each with distinct soloists and orchestrations. The first chorus has a smooth, melodic voice transitioning to a rougher sound. The second features a muted trumpet solo elaborating on the basic melody with extended blue notes. A sweeping clarinet solo in the third chorus is backed by subtle syncopated piano. The fourth chorus has the full band echoing the first with a call and response by brass and reeds. The fifth chorus is climactic, with reeds in a high register and syncopated stop time from brass and rhythm sections. The sixth chorus returns to the first chorus' structure but with the voice using the \"growl\" technique. A vocal run and dissonant trombone ending complete the piece.\n\nEllington’s voice-as-instrument technique is a recurring stylistic trait throughout his work. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines tight orchestration with tone color. A call and response between Bubber Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) builds on this, with Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "She'd always felt an insatiable longing for something, a desire that hadn't been met. It began when she turned 14, just embracing her teenage life, and lingered into her 17th year. She'd come to realize she craved a person, not an item, but her interest in boys remained absent despite some being drawn to her. She puzzled over this strange condition, wondering what could ignite such an unusual reaction in a teenage girl. Despite years of contemplation, she found no definitive answers. So, she carried on, continually questioning her longing.\n\nA typical day at home was usually serene. Her parents were gentle and harmonious, never engaging in arguments with each other or their daughter. The only disputes were about her asserting her independence and vibrant personality, which made her quite likable. Her parents were as calm as could be, but she countered their energy with her lively spirit.\n\nToday was far from calm. As she meandered through the house, seeking inspiration for herself, she heard a sudden cry from the kitchen. Her mother's melodic voice echoed with pain. She rushed in, asking, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She found her mother on the floor, writhing in discomfort. \"Ow... sweet - ty, I ... need you to take me - to the hospital,\" her mother gasped. She rushed to her side, offering assistance. \"Okay, Mom, I'll pick you up. Tell me where.\" Her mother directed her to the car, and she carried her mother, grateful for her strength, to the vehicle.\n\nThe hospital was filled with antiseptic and tension, but her mind was solely focused on helping her mother. She rushed her in and called for help. Doctors quickly gathered and wheeled her mother to the examination area, leaving her to worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a step stool while reaching for a vase in the highest cabinet.",
            "This study aimed to demonstrate that sticking to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean diet score\" (aMed), is linked to a lower risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as reduced stroke mortality. The aMed diet is a tweaked version of the Med diet, featuring increased consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (but excluding potatoes, and including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (compared to saturated fats), and fish, along with decreased intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is also allowed.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that adhering to a Med diet is inversely associated with the risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality, and it was found to be more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering the total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio among obese individuals. However, these studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological research tracked 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, with no history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Every six years from 1984 to 2004, the authors calculated an aMed diet score using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake over the preceding year. More than 95% of the nurses continued participating throughout the 20-year period. FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed through medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, cases were considered \"probable\" and included, with around 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts thus classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and use of postmenopausal hormones were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed.\n\nTo minimize random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could mislead results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to examine the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile had lower risks for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In 2007, the United States of America faced a severe financial meltdown. Unemployment surged, the housing market tanked, and several major corporations were left in shambles. We must ponder: how did this catastrophe unfold, and how can we prevent it from happening again? In essence, the crisis was created by selfish and naive political choices that pressured banks and corporations into issuing sub-prime loans to an underdeveloped and insufficient financial system. Concurrently, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were coerced to underwrite and repack these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’s. When borrowers defaulted, the banks lacked capital reserves and transferred this turmoil onto the repacked mortgages they’d sold, and onto the broader economy.\nThe origins of this crisis can be traced back to 1999, during the Clinton administration's drive for a second term. To boost his popularity, Clinton relaxed lending restrictions, paving the way for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times in 1999 warned, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest mortgage underwriter, is under pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand loans to low and moderate-income individuals while feeling the pressure from shareholders to maintain its impressive profit growth.” Holmes accurately predicted the consequences: “But the government-subsidized corporation may face trouble in an economic downturn, requiring a government rescue similar to the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As foreshadowed, imprudent lending led to the economic collapse.\nSeveral factors contributed to the economic nosedive, one being the novel and intricate mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDO’s were widely used leading up to the crisis, further entangling the economy with the housing market. This over-leveraging left households and financial markets highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\nEventually, the housing bubble burst, leaving financial institutions that bought these mortgage-backed securities in disarray. The top five U.S. investment banks reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, representing about 30% of the USA’s GDP. Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a discount, Lehman Brothers was dissolved, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were compelled to become commercial banks under intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Exposition, that tricky beast, can be both your friend and foe in storytelling. It's where you dip your toes into the story, setting the stage or laying the groundwork for the adventure to come. Or, it's where your readers might lose interest and hit that \"Back\" button, cursing your name.\n\nDr. Merlin, our resident writing expert, has her own beef with exposition—when it's too much, it can be a snoozefest. She's had times where she's shouted at her monitor during those long passages where nothing happens, or where every minute detail of a character's life is laid out like an infomercial.\n\nExposition is the process of sharing information with the audience about what has happened or is going on. It's like the character who tells another character a detailed history, like in \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, the author is the one doing the storytelling.\n\nConsider this: you're reading a story where the heroine meets her beloved at a specific place and time, they wed in a grand affair, and then her husband is brutally murdered in front of her. The story takes pages to get to this point, and both characters barely speak. You'd expect more than that; you'd want to see how deeply they love each other, how his presence has transformed her life. You'd want to know about his mannerisms, his dreams, his hopes, and how his death impacts her.\n\nIn essence, you want meat on the bones of the story, not just a list of events: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, it's your job to provide that substance. It's tempting to rush over certain details, like introducing a new character who used to be in the Air Force, now runs a gas station, was married twice, loves fishing, and dreams of owning the station someday. While these details can be useful, they shouldn't be dumped all at once. Show us why these details matter, and how they shape the character and the story.",
            "I caught two news reports from Columbus, Ohio. The first was NBC 4, which aired live this morning on August 13, 2011. The top story was about a man named Shad Hostettler who had stabbed his wife, though they didn't mention her name. They showed his mug shot, and he looked menacing. This story got about two minutes of coverage, which seemed fitting for its developing nature. The next report was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, an 18-year-old who was critically injured in the Sharon Woods area. No arrests had been made yet, and the SWAT Team was investigate. This story seemed brief, possibly due to racial bias. I've long noticed that minorities often get less coverage when they're crime victims compared to white victims. The following story was about a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter, caused by a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers was offering a $5,000 reward for tips leading to the shooter's arrest. There was also a story about rain and thunderstorms expected for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to stay in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. They devoted a short amount of time to this, perhaps as a teaser to keep viewers tuned in. Another story was about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF, with a dark-skinned black man as the suspect. He was described as about six-foot tall and weighing around 150 pounds. They spent an unusual amount of time emphasizing his race and appearance. There was also a story about a convicted drug kingpin named Rene Rodriguez, who had conspired to distribute marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Instead of saying he was sentenced to 25 years, they said \"300\" months, which seemed strange. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, though this detail didn't seem relevant to the story.",
            "There's a bond between brothers, a bond that's unbreakable and irrevocable. This bond is filled with a mix of emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. Brothers understand each other deeply, almost as if they're mirror images of one another. It's during the toughest times that this bond becomes most apparent, showcasing both the good and the bad. When these emotions surface, they come with a heavy price. Part of understanding the emotions that stem from this fraternal connection is coping with the consequences that follow. By looking into a brother's eyes, one sees not just their reflection, but also their true self. Their actions and the outcomes of those actions reveal their genuine character. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers grapple with this theme and the intense emotions it entails. Amidst a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys embark on a doomed journey. In the climax, bitter disappointment and immense pride collide, with only one brother surviving. The theme is conveyed through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which delves into the protagonist's complex feelings and his view of the world, factors that heavily influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist’s actions are driven by a single emotion: pride. From their first adventure together to their final, fateful outing, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He had envisioned a brother who could learn all his skills, like holding his breath, running, or climbing the vines of Old Woman Swamp. He desired a brother to race to Horsehead Landing and to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn. But Doodle was born with a weak heart, making such activities unlikely. This dash of reality crushed the protagonist's dreams. Anger even brewed within him, as he contemplated suffocating Doodle with a pillow. Who could harbor such thoughts? Yet, his heart softened when Doodle smiled at him, instilling hope. This showed that his conviction wasn't strong. Deep down, he loved his brother.",
            "The brain, a marvel of complexity, is a creative information processor. As technology evolved from primitive to modern, so too did the metaphors used to describe it.

Keep in mind that while these metaphors are useful, they also have limitations and can lead to inaccurate conclusions.\n\nInformation processing commences with signals entering through the senses, which convert physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, or light into electrical signals. These signals are repeatedly processed by the brain in top-down and bottom-up ways. For instance, when gazing at an image of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing compiles basic details like color, orientation, and edges to deduce the presence of a box. Top-down processing then uses these findings to speed up recognition, perhaps helping you identify it as a black box instead of a white hole.\n\nOnce processed, an attention filter ranks the importance of the signal and determines which cognitive processes should act upon it. For example, while your brain processes every blade of grass as you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. However, you can pick out your name even in a noisy room. This multi-stage processing, with attention modulating the results repeatedly, allows the brain to function efficiently.\n\nFor information to be processed, it first needs to be stored. Various types of memory exist, including sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information is encoded in specific ways suited to each type of stimulus. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally (how the word looks), phonemically (how it sounds), or semantically (what it means). Once encoded, information must be maintained. Some studies suggest that working memory, storing info for about 20 seconds, does so through a brief electrical loop in certain neurons. Long-term memory is believed to be maintained by specific protein structures.\n\nNumerous models attempt to explain how knowledge is organized in the brain, drawing from how people retrieve memories, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that concepts are represented as nodes linked based on their relatedness. For example, in such a network, “chair” might link to “table,” which could connect to “wooden,” and so forth.",
            "Aldous Huxley takes a critical stand against the impending danger posed by technology and the capitalist system that supports it, as seen in his dystopian novel, Brave New World. The society values collective over individuality and is programmed from birth to prioritize instant gratification over any other pursuit. The people are essentially pawns in a larger scheme, subjected to a single ideology enforced by the World Controller. Through a Marxist lens, one can discern Huxley’s reservations about the rise of such systems. Terms like homogeny and reification, frequently used in Marxism, underscore the critique of emerging economic structures from Huxley's time.\n\nCapitalism is mocked through the Marxist concept of false consciousness, in which the common people are blinded to their true economic relations to other classes. This is due to ideological control over the proletariat and common laborers, evident in the conditioning of citizens in Brave New World. The lower classes, like Deltas and Gammas, have no true agency; hypnopædia instills a desire to consume, spend, and indulge, manipulated by the World Controller. Hegemony, the dominance of one social class over another, is clearly depicted. The lower classes are unaware of this manipulation, truly 'buying into an ideology that supports the structure' (i.e., capitalism and consumerism). The upper classes, born into awareness, do little more than accept their roles, save for a few Alphas or Betas like Bernard. Interactions among social classes further illustrate the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nIn Brave New World, individual relationships lack depth, with characters often indistinguishable from one another. Perhaps Huxley suggests that the rise of technology and capitalism together strip individuals of their free will and expression. Love and strong emotions don't exist, replaced by superficial interactions, particularly in the way males discuss women based on their physical attributes (like 'pneumatic quality') and females shamelessly share their encounters. Each class's complacence with their status indicates the socioeconomic effects of capitalism. Their unquestioning obedience to their role in society reflects Marxist thoughts on the proletariat, who are falsely reassured of their superiority through consumption and compliance with their peers.",
            "I've been a University Park student for nearly two and a half years, or around four and a half semesters. Navigating campus can be a challenge. My freshman year, I lived in East Halls, the farthest eastward campus residence, close to stadiums and the Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from Stuart Hall to classes in distant places like Willard building could take up to 25 minutes, especially in State College's harsh weather. Talking to an older alum revealed that East Halls used to be isolated by vast tracts of vacant land. Now, those empty spaces are filled with sports fields, new buildings, and apartments. As campus grows, traveling between places becomes tougher. The solution? Bikes. But bikes alone won't help; students must ride them, and the campus must be designed for cyclists. My friend, who resumed biking after a hiatus, found it the only efficient way to get around. Biking, combined with a bit of oatmeal and exertion, covers 30 miles easily. Like many students, I now live off campus, as distant from the center as some dorms. My smartest decision this year was buying a bike. Daily classes at Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from home, now take just 5 minutes on a bike. The catch? Pollock Road, the direct route, isn't always bike-friendly. While walking has its merits, I'm too busy to walk. Without a bike, walking would be my only option, adding 30-40 minutes to my daily routine, or over two and a half hours weekly. Add to that time spent walking to other classes and appointments, and it's more time than I can afford."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",

To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1).

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",

They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "In my journey towards becoming a social worker, I aim to serve the Division of Family and Children Services, assisting those who have endured abuse or neglect and supporting troubled families. The values that I can bring to the social work field include dedication, respect, and an unwavering commitment to improving relationships within families and continuously enhancing my professional competence. These core values aren't merely important for social workers; they are integral to who I am as a person.\n\nMy desire to help others has always been strong, but I was uncertain about the career path to follow. Throughout high school and college, I observed many individuals retreat from their problems in denial or resort to unhealthy coping mechanisms. These experiences guided me towards pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still undecided about my career, I took a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. One summer day, visiting a friend, I met a sixteen-year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. He was there to escape his abusive parents. The following day, I learned he had called the police to his parents’ house. I drove over to assist, explaining my concerns to the police and offering to speak with the parents, who seemed nervous and blamed their son for involving outsiders in disputes. This experience ignited my serious consideration for a career in social work to assist children in resolving family conflicts.\n\nMoreover, social justice is a crucial value in the field of social work. Society often claims the importance of the individual while mourning those lost, yet the concept of individuality we hold is often rooted in archaic traditions rather than uniqueness. If society mourns lost individuals, why do we strive to be similar to \"everyone else\"? I consider myself unique and reject societal limitations. Throughout my academic years, I stood against social injustice by expressing myself through unorthodox hairstyles, unconventional clothing, and piercings, and by actively participating in the GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance) and advocating against racism and discrimination. I remain committed to social justice and will continue to fight against injustice.",
            "This report delves into the Biological and Sociocultural frameworks related to the sleep disorder insomnia. The Biological model emphasizes genetic traits inherited from parents and the medical aspects of health. Meanwhile, the Sociocultural models consider environmental factors and their connections to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia examines these models and discusses the research selected to relate and explain them. The explanations of the research findings are then critiqued, highlighting their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized as primary, secondary, or associated with medical issues or substance intake. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, while secondary ones relate to mental disorders. Other categories involve medical complications or substance use. Dyssomnias include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia is characterized by trouble initiating or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is difficulty staying awake for at least a month. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/or automatic REM. Dyssomnias focus on sleep initiation and maintenance, whereas Parasomnias involve behavioral abnormalities and/or physiological occurrences, such as Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders related to mental disorders are linked to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review primarily focuses on insomnia and primary sleep disorders in relation to the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders explores genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired components. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice found that GABAB receptors on orexin neurons control sleep/wake states. Activating the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, and inhibiting it can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. GABAB agonists like baclofen increase sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). These mouse models indicate that genetic and environmental factors influence human sleep, possibly altering the GABAB receptor's function. This could affect sleep quality, impacting daily activities such as school, career, and monotonous tasks.",
            "This paper delves into three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), often called Auditory Processing Disorder (APD). It begins with a quick definition of the disorder, then moves on to diagnosis, highlighting common characteristics, or “red flags”. Lastly, it provides strategies for teachers in mainstream classrooms to help students with CAPD.\n\n\tCAPD, or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is defined as the efficiency and effectiveness with which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. To break it down, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies it. In simpler terms, it explains that the brain struggles to properly process sounds heard. People with CAPD can hear normally but have difficulty separating words or distinguishing conversation from background noise. It's not a hearing impairment but a brain function issue.\n\n\tThe earliest mention of this disorder dates back to the mid-1950s, referred to as “auditory imperception”. Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari started developing tests for children with communicative disorders in 1954. In 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception. The disorder gained more attention at a national conference held in 1977, which sparked research on children with CAPD.\n\n\tCAPD can manifest in various ways: individuals may struggle to localize or hear sounds in space, discriminate between sounds, recognize sound patterns, differentiate changes in speech, have sound synthesis difficulties, or determine the sequence of auditory information. No one tool or test consistently diagnoses CAPD, and its cause remains unknown. Diagnosis involves systematic observation of listening behavior and performance on tests of auditory function, conducted by audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others. Common tests present patients with multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli and ask for them to differentiate items like words or numbers. Advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals in the ear and measuring responses.",
            "The play \"Twelfth Night\" seems to assert that while disguise can be quite handy for deceiving others over extended periods, it's ultimately crucial to discard that new persona to prevent losing oneself forever. The challenge lies in ending such deception, as it might leave one feeling isolated. One must then choose between safeguarding their personal identity or maintaining relationships with others. While some may remain indifferent upon discovering a deception, others might find it repulsive and be offended by the entire charade.\n\nThe theme of deception in gender role reversal is quite complex, as it raises several questions. For instance, why does the individual feel compelled to forsake their own identity and adopt a disguise as the opposite gender? In Viola's case, it's clear she would rather protect herself from potential harm: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249) Arriving in an unfamiliar land, Viola dons a male disguise to shield herself from potential attackers. Her plan succeeds, yet it also isolates her from female company, disconnecting her from a vital support system. Worse still, her convincing portrayal of a man leads Olivia to mistake her for Sebastian and fall in love with her: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) Additionally, she must grapple with repressed romantic feelings towards Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\n\nToday’s readers might see \"Twelfth Night\" as an example of how deception can help uncover suppressed emotions, particularly in Olivia and Orsino's cases. Some passages hint that these characters may harbor unspoken desires that Viola/Cesario’s appearance forces them to confront. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because he appears to be a man, or does she secretly harbor feelings for females? It seems unlikely, as Shakespeare’s character Olivia appears more likely to be mocking the societal norms of his time, who judged others solely based on their appearance, as seen by the ease with which she shifts her affections from Cesario to Sebastian and considers Cesario/Viola as family: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)",
            "The German colonial rule's cruelty, particularly the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa, has been well-documented. However, it's inaccurate to label the entire colonial empire with a single description, as policies and governance varied greatly among colonies. Educational provision also differed significantly. When the British took over German East Africa, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also commended by contemporary authors. The situation in South West Africa was starkly different. Unlike East Africa, where the government played a significant role in educating natives through state schools, in South West Africa, the task was largely left to missionary societies with limited government backing. The government did invest heavily in European education, establishing state schools and supporting missionary schools. These policies had lasting effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies had many literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergent experience. This paper aims to explore these factors, focusing on new research into the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\nThere is extensive literature on education in the German colonial empire, much written in German and produced during or shortly after the colonial period. Early works primarily described the educational systems of these colonies. Later English works expanded on the discourse through comparative studies and detailed analyses. These studies highlighted significant differences across colonial educational systems. Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa is particularly relevant to this paper. He compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that explain their differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa is a significant factor in shaping the colony's educational system.\nSouth West Africa boasted a moderately temperate climate, with much of the territory covered by arid desert. This relatively hospitable environment led to a moderate European population. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, compared to just 5,336 in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "The classification of Popular Music has expanded over the past 100 years, encompassing so many genres that it's tough to list them all. To make matters more complex, nearly every genre—rap, rock, country, jazz, folk—has grown into numerous sub and sub-sub genres. Within the realm of Heavy Metal rock, this diversification has made it one of the most expressive and varied genres in popular music over the last 40 years. It's expressive due to its wide range of emotions, often leaning toward the dark side. It's diverse as well, as soon after its inception, musicians realized its flexibility and began creating their own sub-genres, followed by sub-sub-genres, continuing to this day.\n\nThe heavy metal scene has blossomed into a vast array of niches, making it hard to pin down what exactly qualifies as heavy metal. It has absorbed themes from various genres, but it all stems from a common origin. To truly grasp the metal music prevalent today, one must first understand the essence of the metal movement and why it's more than just a genre.\n\nMetal is, in many ways, a movement defined by darkness. It's a \"music of more\" — more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality, and less primitivism. Metal bands are known for their technical prowess, which shines through in their music. It's also a movement heavily influenced by drug use. The mid-70s psychedelic drug boom led to crazier and otherworldly records, using drugs as inspiration. This genre possesses dark, visceral qualities, a stark contrast to the lighter emotional tones in much of popular music. Later generations of metal musicians have drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral qualities of the Romantic Era. Lyrics like this from Helter Skelter by The Beatles exemplify this darkness and are considered one of the first heavy metal songs. The Beatles wrote it in response to a Rolling Stones song, aiming to prove they could be as heavy as their rivals. The song appeared on The White Album",
            "A few decades before the Surrealists started their dreamlike artwork, Henri Rousseau was already crafting his dreams, both literally and metaphorically. His famous 1910 painting, The Dream, doesn't just depict a woman in awe of the land in her dream; it also reflects Rousseau's personal dreams and aspirations as an artist. Rousseau longed for recognition, acceptance, and praise from other artists and art lovers, but faced an internal struggle: to conform to or mimic certain styles to gain acceptance or to forge his own unique path. The Dream is a prime example of this career-long dilemma.\n\nTo fully understand The Dream, you should know a bit about Rousseau's life. Born in Laval, northwest France, on May 21, 1844, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer who enjoyed a comfortable life. He had no formal art training and worked as a gabelou (municipal toll service employee), earning the nickname douanier (customs inspector). After the deaths of his wife and eight infant children, Rousseau turned to painting for solace and a new start. Unlike his contemporaries who romanticized the peasant in painting, Rousseau was a folk painter, representing the hopes and dreams of the average person.\n\nRousseau's desire for acceptance by the art world is understandable given his context: he was untrained, began painting late in life, and worked alongside many renowned artists. Recognition for his art came around the same time Matisse was gaining fame. Jan Gordon, in Modern French Painters, notes that while Matisse feared painting tritely and Rousseau desired conventionality to gain admission to the Artiste Français, their styles, subjects, and motivations differed greatly.",
            "Numerous wise individuals have pondered the deep connection between ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. I hold that at the core, there's a reason for this. As John Keats suggests in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While much of what we learn in life is through education or experience, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics without formal teaching. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe rather than dictate. Our studies of morality and beauty strive to explain why something is beautiful or moral, rather than providing rules for what is good art or moral behavior. Criticism of art or morals can't fully capture the essence of what is good or beautiful; it often ends with phrases like, \"There's just something about it,\" preceding a deeper explanation. I believe that both art and morals can't be fully reduced to their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor notes, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" In the same way, ethics has a transcendent quality, as Ludwig Wittgenstein says, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental.\" This ineffable \"something\" is the most powerful attribute of both ethics and aesthetics, linking them. I think morality and art are closely related because they impact us at a noumenal level, using a Kantian term—an experience that can be felt but not fully explained. This link is even stronger with literary art. As McKean points out, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Today's Germany is a powerful, united nation with a rich culture that spans from the hidden mountains of München up to the Baltic Sea's shore in Kiel. This cultural tapestry is also felt in cities like Köln along the Rhine, across the heart of Germany, and in the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. Given its diverse origins, it's no surprise that modern Germany is a blend of various tribes and sources.\n\nThe land known as Germania was once the ancestral home of the Germans. The etymology of the name is debated among scholars. Some argue it came from the Tungrian tribe, who were referred to as Germans before crossing the Rhine to clash with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Others suggest the name originates from the spear used in warfare, the \"ger,\" or from the Old Irish word \"garim\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans' loud nature. The earliest known use of the term \"Germanus\" was by Julius Caesar in his accounts of the Gallic Wars, where he distinguished the Germanic tribes from the Gauls (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC).\n\nThe first-century Roman historian Tacitus described the Germanic peoples as indigenous, not intermixed with other races. They had migrated to Germania by sea, not by land, drawn by its wild landscapes and inclement climate (Tacitus, 98). The Romans, while expanding their empire, often traded with and recruited Germanic tribes for their skilled warriors. However, the Romans rarely settled in Germania, preferring to return to their empire. As a result, many Germanic tribes lived on the empire's fringes, trading their goods and skills with the Romans (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).",
            "I stood, my mind a blank slate, as I stared at the scene before me. Unfeeling and detached, my consciousness, acutely aware of the image but not connecting it to any abstract thought, studied the picture at hand. Ideas darted in and out of my mind like a game of ping-pong, so swiftly and smoothly that it seemed I had no personal thoughts, only an active experience of what I was seeing. I had always wanted to draw, ever since I was a child, and a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" promised to teach me everything from recognizing a pencil to understanding how the brain interprets lines. The book advised placing a square frame around any picture to simplify it. At that moment, though, I was too overwhelmed to create that frame. I could only stand there, awestruck. Picasso's blue phase, Monet's love for greenery, and the Italian Renaissance masters' vibrant colors were overwhelming. I felt like I was at the beginning of my art journey, my first work, \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy fingers reached for my chosen tool, muscles tensing and relaxing as my hand moved through the air. My thoughts gave shape and form to the moment, a moment that could have been the most creative of my life. Water swirled, clear and calm. Pieces broke away and were lost in the process. My hand hit the toilet handle again, harder this time, but the offending brown package refused to budge, stuck like a slug. A few more flushes later, I found myself holding the toilet paper roll, wrapped around my hand like an oven mitt. I stood tall, then bent at the waist, my hand slowly dipping into the bowl, like a mother reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey....",
            "Teens are perishing behind the wheel, and it's a deadly combination of factors that's causing these grim statistics. The teen brain just isn't ready for the road's dangers, and inexperience amplifies this problem, leading to more fatal crashes, vehicle rollovers, speeding, and road deviations. Moreover, teens tend to drive with peers, which, as any sensible person knows, they do regularly. A study from the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center found a direct link between the age of passengers and the occurrence of traffic accidents.\n\nIn an effort to improve teen driving safety, several states have implemented provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and prohibit other minors as passengers. However, these are merely temporary solutions. The real issue is that, as a group, young drivers are not equipped to handle the risks and responsibilities of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman argues that 18 is still too young for a regular driver's license. USA Today reports that Zuckerman's research indicates a common desire among those under 19-20 to take risks for the thrill, which makes delaying driving until this tendency subsides a logical decision. If we continue to license young teens to drive, we'll see deadly accidents continue and the death toll may skyrocket in the coming years. By 2010, the Baby Boom generation's children will be eligible to drive, and millions of new teen drivers will hit the road.\n\nLegislation to address this issue could be simple. Schools could offer driver's education classes to start the learning process, but no one under 18 could operate a motor vehicle. Provisional permits could still be issued before a full driver's license, with a set number of practical driver's training hours required. The specific number of hours could be based on the majority of states' requirements (in California, it's 6 hours behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours with an adult). Since teen driving fatalities affect all states, uniform, national legislation would be a sensible and effective way to protect teens across the country.\n\nThe legislation I propose is not a novel idea.",
            "While sifting through the Library of Congress’s archive of early Edison films, I decided to take a look at all the trick films, totaling fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films often use clever editing to create illusions. My analysis mainly focused on the poetic elements of most trick films and identified some unique characteristics in a few of the later ones. Most trick films from this era are confined to a stationary stage, using a frontal proscenium, without camera movement, and relying on long and medium shots. They follow the one shot = one film method closely.\n\nOne striking similarity among these trick films is that they are shot within a static interior set, with the camera remaining fixed in its position, mirroring the stage or vaudeville tradition. This immobility often restricts actors to side-to-side movements without approaching or retreating from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors move back and forth horizontally, but the camera does not follow them.\n\nLong shots and, less frequently, medium shots are the norm, with close-ups being absent from all Edison trick films. This approach mimics early theatre and vaudeville practices, where the entire performance was visible within the stage's frame. Actors do not move towards the camera, making close-ups unnecessary.\n\nMany early trick films adhere to the one conceptual shot = one film rule, which limits their length to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second. This also restricts their narrative or dramatic content to brief vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic or disappearing acts. However, a single conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes can consist of multiple joined physical shots to create illusions. For example, in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a closer inspection reveals that the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” starts at a specific point, but the entire film is perceived as one continuous shot by viewers.",
            "John Taylor, hailing from Caroline, was an early and passionate advocate for the Republican cause. His background as an agriculturalist and brief political career instilled in him a steadfast commitment to personal liberties and government policies.

The preservation and promotion of this superior career drove his arguments on sovereignty, constitutionalism, and the judicial system.",
            "Looking back at Figure 17, there was a steep decline in commuter log submissions during the third month of the project, which was quite disheartening. The reasons for this aren't entirely clear, but it could be attributed to the approach of winter in a New England campus, leading to a drop in bicycle and foot commuters. Additionally, December marks the end of the fall semester and the busy period of finishing schoolwork and processing grades, which might have caused log submissions to slip people's minds. The holidays also bring a month-long break for students and faculty, further reducing the need to commute to campus. Classes resume in late January, which may also explain the low number of logs for that month. It's worth noting that any project like this often experiences an initial burst of enthusiasm that may naturally wane over time. To counteract this, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which indeed led to an increase in log submissions for that month. One of the challenges we faced was maintaining project momentum despite natural declines in engagement and the impact of holiday and semester breaks on higher education. Another significant challenge was the cultural preference for driving cars, which provides freedom, independence, and flexibility. To incentivize alternative commuting methods, we offered various prizes such as gift certificates for local restaurants, coffee shops, a massage therapist, the local independent bookstore, and even some national chain stores. While the gift cards were sufficient at the project's start, offering larger prizes like bicycles, hybrid cars, or electric cars might have boosted participation and engagement. Increasing the value of prizes over time, perhaps announcing more substantial ones like a bicycle in December and a hybrid or electric car in January, could have potentially increased participation.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a financial tool that mimics an index, commodity, or a mix of assets, trading like a stock on an exchange. An ETF offers both the diversification of an index fund and the perks of single stock ownership, like short-selling, margin trading, and buying fractional shares. These advantages are compelling, but ETFs generally come with a lower expense ratio compared to mutual funds. However, there are drawbacks, such as trading commissions, similar to stock orders. Plus, ETFs provide a wide range of options. Yet, it's crucial for savvy investors to assess whether the stated benefits, like diversification, are real and to what extent. For this analysis, we'll examine the ETF IHF and compare its top 10 holdings to determine if owning a single ETF approximates the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks, and if there are better ways to configure these stocks for a better risk-return trade-off.\n\nTo manage the scope, we'll focus on the top 10 holdings, which hold 63.58% of the ETF's assets. Here's the list:\n\nTo gauge how well these top 10 stocks represent the ETF IHF, we'll calculate their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return, using their current asset percentages normalized to 100%. The results are shown below:\n\nThe chart reveals that a portfolio of just these top 10 holdings yields a 6.11% higher return and a 0.12 lower Beta than the ETF. This suggests that a portfolio of the top 10 holdings could offer higher returns and lower risk. However, these portfolios might not be statistically different from each other.\n\nTo confirm whether these portfolios are indeed different, we'll calculate the standard deviation of each top 10 stock and normalize it to 100% to compare their combined standard deviation with the ETF IHF's standard deviation.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe's \"Dream-Land\" is often hailed as one of his better poems. In this piece, Poe employs the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, a reference traced back to Virgil. Originally used by the Greeks to denote an island north of Britain, Thulé was considered the edge of the known world. While it's clear that Virgil utilized this term, a more contemporary source also merits consideration—Poe's affinity for German authors. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" notes the similarities between Poe's and Goethe's poems, concluding that Poe was indeed imitating Goethe.\n\nGoethe, a renowned German writer, is celebrated for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts: the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Goethe's death, 1832. Within the second part, a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé\" tells the story of a king who, after his wife's death, begins to drink heavily and eventually takes his own life. The parallels between the King of Thule and the speaker in \"Dream-Land\" are striking, particularly in their shared sense of loss and despair. A romantic drama adaptation of Faust by H.P. Grattan was published in 1842, just months before Poe's use of the term \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe references Thule twice in his collected works. In \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" he refers to \"ultma Thule,\" while in \"Dream-Land,\" he uses the term as bookends for the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes the landscape of Thule as dark, lonely, and haunted by the ghosts of his dead friends, mirroring the melancholic and bereft state of the King of Thule. The poem suggests that the speaker has stepped into Goethe's work.\n\nGoethe's influence on Poe is significant. Poe may have encountered Goethe's works through his admiration for Tennyson or through the numerous reproductions circulating after the original publications.",
            "Under California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\nA judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim outright. To justify punitive damages, a plaintiff must prove the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for probable harm, as well as demonstrating that the conduct was reprehensible. Palmer could argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill given multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping before her accident, yet he still neglected to clean it. While her claim about Martin’s actions being despicable is less forceful, it remains reasonable given the six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009 and Martin’s continued inaction to ensure store safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, informed his manager, Paul Martin, of an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin replied he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Mr. Martin about the spill. Martin responded similarly. At 5:30 pm on that day, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Before Palmer’s accident, five different slip-and-fall incidents had occurred at D&D’s in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering filing a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of a non-contractual obligation if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud, or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct intending to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have deemed conduct malicious when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "I took an Islam course at CBC four years ago, and the discussion on whether Islam is hostile was heated. This question is more pertinent today. The media's view of Islam and extremists shifted drastically after 9/11, from hostile to extremely tolerant, making it hard to imagine a president like Barack Obama, whose family has an obvious Muslim background. The Prophet Muhammad's biography intrigues me because it portrays him as a martyr, misunderstood and humble, rather than a conqueror who forced converts. This portrayal seems to overshadow the life of Jesus Christ and even implies that Muhammad was a sort of substitute. The biography also often presents 'witness' stories heard from third parties, which diminishes their credibility. I find it most concerning that the biography elevates Muhammad to an almost godly figure, contradicting historical accounts of his rise to power.",
            "The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were quickly abandoned in the evolution of Christian thought following his life. As we examine this history in broad terms, a pattern emerges where Christianity diverged further and further from its roots. The modern world seems to be increasingly aware and progressive. While traditionalists remain, their influence may not be sufficient to shape the whole. Among Christians, a historical consciousness will surely grow in the coming years. A desire will arise to distinguish the doctrines added to Christianity over time from Jesus' original intent. Though it may take decades or centuries, the outcome is unstoppable: Christianity will reverse its historical trend, returning to its original form. A movement will develop, peeling away layers of doctrine one by one, as if the clock were turning backward, leaving only the essence of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other philosophers made such claims. When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, encouraging millions to worship as they did in Jesus' time, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to guide the way. However, as the theological clock moves backward, the diverse proliferation of beliefs in Christendom will reverse into uniformity. Between regions, denominations, and divisions of every kind, we will see increasing similarities instead of differences. History is filled with such reversals. Consider how Christians were once persecuted, shunned, and killed by the Roman Empire, only to later have that empire become Christian. Our country has progressed from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The coming great reversal in Christian history will unfold, undoing history in search of its source and reversing diversity in the process. An important factor in making this possible will be interpreting Jesus' words metaphorically, not literally. So, what transpired since Jesus' lifetime?\n\nIf we delve deeply into history, we find only Judaism as the theological origin of Christianity. Monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were central to the religion by the time the Romans conquered Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population was not united in spirit. They split into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the majority of common people.",
            "I reckon The Jungle demonstrates that people, deep down, are inherently selfish and self-serving. They strive to make their lives the best they can without concerning themselves with those less fortunate. The novel underscores this through the owners and managers of the colossal factories. Their sole aim is to expand their empires, disregarding any obstacle, whether it's people or creatures, that might impede their progress. As Upton Sinclair writes, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This vivid imagery conveys the immense damage the pollution is causing, while highlighting the owners' callous disregard for anyone or anything harmed by their pursuits. They couldn't care less about the suffocating smoke pouring from the factories or the waste from the countless pens around Packingtown. Their apathy extends to their employees, whom they exploit mercilessly to increase profits. \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They subject workers to grueling hours and summarily dismiss them without compensation or job assistance, all while safety regulations were virtually nonexistent. Consequently, the hardships faced by those who perished in Packingtown were accepted as the norm, with no recourse or assistance available. Unions, intended to aid the workers, often ended up exploiting them further. The workers found themselves trapped in a system akin to slavery, forced into terrible living and working conditions, with no way out. As Sinclair eloquently puts it, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Many creators employ various methods to evoke specific feelings or attitudes in their readers towards significant themes. Some of these strategies are more potent than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes numerous techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald combines an adjective with a noun in an unconventional way to create a certain ambiance around a subject. Other times, he assigns meaning to a symbol and then employs it for the same purpose. Fitzgerald employs this latter technique with several colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In his novel, Fitzgerald builds up connotations for these colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, which he later uses to evoke feelings around important objects.\n\nFitzgerald assigns a meaning to white/gray, with white representing a higher class and gray symbolizing age and fadedness. He establishes this meaning early in the novel through repeated references to both colors. Daisy and Jordan are consistently \"in white\" (8), with everyone else wearing white, such as Nick in \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby's party, Tom in a \"white shirt\" (36) during his meeting with Myrtle, and Catherine in \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only deviation is when Nick observes Gatsby's party: \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further reinforces these colors by assigning them to mundane subjects: Nick's commute takes him \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the names of guests at Gatsby's parties are \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's schedule, Catherine's apartment is a \"slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses,\" and plain or common people and places are described as white or gray, such as Jordan and Daisy's \"white girlhood\" (19) together, the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"gray Italian child\" on the train (26), and the dog-seller, a \"gray old man\" (27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald infuses white/gray with sufficient meaning, he uses these colors to signify insignificance or uniformity around certain subjects. This technique begins with Daisy. After a prolonged absence of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster,\" making her seem less of a character and more like a uniform addition, something Gatsby desires and yearns for (74). Fitzgerald continues this technique around Daisy to convey her uniformity, such as the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18), and her appearance in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",

Common crops here are tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There's a thriving market for organic, community-supported agriculture in the area, with long waiting lists for local organizations. Organic eggs and milk are also in demand.

            "Culture, in many ways, shapes and dictates the dynamics of any negotiation. It's a complex tapestry woven with threads of shared beliefs, traditions, and behaviors that can vary widely between and even within groups. A culture is not merely a homogenous entity; it's a multifaceted entity that can be understood just as much by what it is not as by what it is. Generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" oversimplify cultural nuances and can be misleading. While broad generalizations about a culture can be useful, a successful negotiator must understand the specific cultural context and how it influences the negotiation process.\n\nWhen engaging with a foreign culture, one often compares it to their own, leading to inevitable comparisons. This understanding can be gained through studying its history, customs, and even its biases. Instead of attempting to change or judge a culture, a negotiator should accept it for what it is and navigate it, especially when they hold a weaker position at the table. Respect for local traditions and beliefs can help in overcoming cultural barriers and advancing negotiations.\n\nIt's also crucial to recognize that culture isn't confined to national borders. Companies within the same nation can have distinct corporate cultures. For instance, one company might prioritize long working hours while another prefers a more flexible schedule. Signs of corporate culture can be seen in employee attire, communication styles (direct versus indirect), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy from employees, while others restrict it to approved causes. These differences can be as pronounced within the United States as they are across different regions and urban/suburban environments.\n\nValues are especially important to understand as they provide the 'why' behind a culture. If a culture values 'saving face' or 'communal harmony,' a negotiator will be cautious about publicly shaming an opponent to secure a deal. Similarly, if a culture values a hard-driven bargain, negotiations might be more tenacious. Knowing these values beforehand can significantly impact a negotiator's approach. However, understanding the personal background of the opposing negotiator can further enhance the effectiveness of the negotiation.",
            "The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’ This sentiment is first seen in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and is the foundation for St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. Similarly, this view is held by another author, Thomas Aquinas, who also defends this belief. Given our task is to compare these arguments, we must, for simplicity, assume they are both correct in their belief in God, specifically the God of the Bible. To contrast, we would not be able to compare their arguments effectively if we included a different type of God.\n\nWhile both authors present valid points, neither truly offers a comprehensive basis for belief in God. We will first examine St. Anselm’s argument. Anselm suggests that understanding God lies within one’s own mind, and that the proof for God is found by examining what we inherently know to be true. He implies that external evidence is unnecessary for this proof, which is often referred to as faith.\n\nThomas Aquinas, on the other hand, argues that God’s existence can be proven through reason and empirical evidence, negating the need for faith. This approach is beneficial for evangelism as it allows for logical persuasion of new converts without relying on their willingness to accept unprovable truths. Aquinas presents five logical arguments: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument demonstrates that the proof of God exists in the logical necessity of God.",
            "Around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince, who would later be known as Buddha, was born. Throughout his life, he abandoned the world and attained enlightenment, leading to the creation of Buddhism, with the most conservative branch being Theravada Buddhism. This religion emerged about 2500 years ago and has evolved significantly over time. For example, in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laypeople alike participate, though Buddha never taught about such a festival. These changes span from superficial traditions to the heart of the religion itself. Over time, the Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic and lay perspectives, has modified its core beliefs due to various internal and external factors, some hostile and others benign.\n\nSome key terms we'll use often include internal versus external forces. Internal forces are those originating from within the Buddhist community, regardless of monastic status. External forces are from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that harm or intend to harm the Buddhist community, often driven by a negative view of Buddhism. Benign forces do not intend to harm or help the community, but may still do so. These terms will appear frequently in this discussion.\n\nFirst, let's explore the basics of the religion—its core doctrines. Buddhists find refuge in the Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is composed of the Tripitaka, the three baskets of Buddhist scripture. The Sutta Pitaka includes all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines rules for conduct, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka covers the religion's metaphysical aspects. Key metaphysical concepts include Anatta (no-self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these concepts allows one to escape Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth. Along with this, lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) will cease when one becomes enlightened. The Vinaya Pitaka provides rules for laypeople and monks. Laypeople follow five key precepts: I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not engage in sexual misconduct, and I shall not consume intoxicating substances. Monks have many more rules to adhere to. The core doctrinal notion is the Four Noble Truths: First, that life is full of suffering (Dukkha). Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States of America and Mexico once shared a longstanding rivalry that lasted 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145). The height of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States successfully defeated Mexico and gained Texas and the American Southwest as new territories. There were numerous other skirmishes between the two nations, with tensions easing before the First World War.\n\nThis is not unique to the United States and Mexico. Many neighboring nations face similar rivalries due to shared borders. David M. Pletcher (1977) points out that \"only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting, overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Both Mexico and Cuba are geographically close to the United States and have historically been rivals, unlike other Latin American nations which have maintained good relations.\n\nReligious differences were a significant source of tension, a problem many nations have faced throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) notes that in the 18th and 19th centuries, Americans opposed Catholicism and monarchy, similar to the ideological struggles of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union (p.86). This distrust was inherited from the English and Spanish colonial rulers, making amiable foreign relations difficult to establish.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes during this 57-year period. Most of these involved territorial issues, including border raids from Mexican territory and other frontier problems. Bandits and outlaws from American border towns were a significant issue until both countries exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) explains that the rivalry began to ease as Mexico became significantly dependent on the United States and finally ended as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico in the later part of the 19th century (p. 109-110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, I found myself unexpectedly disabled by an ailment I had never heard of.

Despite my dream to be a scientist or journalist, perhaps a bit of both, I chose nursing. Now, here I am—46, single, with no savings and unable to work. I've been living on Social Security Disability for 15 years, and now I have nothing left to call my own. Every day is a struggle, an assault on my security, safety, and self-esteem.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do? Are there constraints that guide the course of evolutionary change? While D'Arcy Thompson, in 1917, mused that \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" this sentiment still holds true today. Recent studies have applied mathematical modeling to various aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis, both ontogenetically and phylogenetically (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our investigation explores how combining mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, along with experimental studies, can elucidate the mechanisms driving evolutionary-developmental shifts. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters, which were then modeled using the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We created hypothetical shell morphologies to interpret the limits of possible morphological changes in Prunum. These results are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to better understand macroevolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a tube that evolves through 360 degrees of space over time. These 360-degree turns are called whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis known as the columella. This columella runs through the central column of the shell. The rate at which whorls enlarge can vary, with a continuous line separating each whorl called a suture. Typically, the largest whorl of a shell is the last one, referred to as the body whorl. The spire is all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire, while the base is the opposite end. The animal exits its shell through an opening known as the aperture.\n\nShells can be examined from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. The \"usual\" orientation is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.\n\nTo count whorls, first view the shell from the apical perspective and determine where the first suture begins. Draw a line dividing the shell into two parts, then count the whorls from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures that evolve through time and space as the animal builds its shell. The trajectory of the aperture can be tracked using the coordinates of each whorl's aperture center, as well as its horizontal and vertical radius.\n\nThis trajectory can be represented graphically and mathematically. Once a mathematical formulation is established, parameters can be varied and modified to alter the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "The neonatal and infant mortality rates in Indonesia have not seen significant improvement over the past decade. Despite the country's progress towards several Millennium Development Goals, including water and sanitation targets, the progress in child and maternal health lags behind the 2015 goal. Reasons for this include inefficiencies in healthcare delivery and access issues. Indonesia has made strides in the number of births attended by skilled workers, with 72% meeting this target, but it includes traditional workers like midwives who lack medical intervention capabilities, which contributes to high maternal death rates. Additionally, there has been a decline in professional treatment of diarrhea cases in children under five, and postnatal care remains a concern with low rates nationwide. C-section rates remain low, at 4%, with urban rates at 7% and rural at 2%, highlighting healthcare disparities. There is also a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, indicating that the poor struggle more with healthcare access due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nIn considering how to address these issues, the primary question is whether Indonesia should focus on program-specific solutions or strengthen its overall healthcare system. While targeted programmatic approaches can yield faster results and have clear objectives, they may divert resources from other areas and lead to duplicated, uncoordinated services. For instance, heavy investment in HIV/AIDS programming has negatively impacted family planning efforts. Therefore, a balanced approach that addresses both the immediate challenges and the broader healthcare system is likely necessary.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their meticulous attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the era. Yet, two notable exceptions are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, which break from this mold with their mysterious elements and unique flair. Both works reveal the characters' inner selves, their pains, and their true nature, through these mysterious aspects, which are often depicted through dream sequences or dreamlike states. For instance, in Oliver Twist, such occurrences unveil insights into Oliver's inner turmoil, his awareness of his surroundings, and his lack of control over his fate. When Oliver relives the shooting vividly in chapter 28, it is as if he is in a dream, highlighting his inability to influence the events unfolding around him. The shooting is depicted as overwhelming, numbing his senses and leaving him with constant, dreadful pain linked to fear, rather than surprise. This dreamlike scene underscores Oliver's helplessness and the growing sense of defeat that he has been forced to accept, perhaps by the influence of Fagin. This reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over his own destiny. The passage also hints at a deeper mystery, raising questions about who or what caused his misfortune, as it was clearly not his own doing. This sequence emphasizes Oliver's inability to regain control of his life, even when it is on the line.",
            "A couple of years ago, I was working in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to assist them in their subjects, but my strengths were in English and reading. A fellow instructor recruited me to help a young boy named Adrian, who was having trouble reading. It was clear that something was off; he could pronounce some letters correctly, while others he got completely wrong, which was puzzling. Adrian was of Latino descent and spoke perfect English, but his reading was a struggle. We kept working on it until I met his mother during a babysitting session. She didn't speak a word of English, only Spanish. Despite my limited Spanish, we managed to communicate. It dawned on me then: Adrian could read fine, he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I'm not sure if my realization helped him much, but I hope he's doing better now. I share this story to highlight the language barrier in schools, especially in California, and to illustrate that it's not always as apparent as we think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English, reading can still be challenging. The problem is widespread, so what can we do? In Adrian's case, the solution was straightforward: tutoring in English reading, particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. However, for many children who barely speak English, the solution is much more complex. There's no single answer. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes—none of these alone will solve the problem. The key is to combine all these methods!",
            "From our childhood, many of us are taught that there's something greater than ourselves, something we can't grasp. Some of us are brought to Sunday school, while others visit temples or search within ourselves for understanding. Some readily accept the beliefs passed down by our parents, while others reject them, denying there's anything beyond our self-centered universe.

            "The classic \"Gothic Novel,\" as Ian Watt puts it in \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel,\" is an 'oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" blending the old and the new in both form and substance. The Gothic genre has been both celebrated and critiqued, praised for its 'terrible sublime' and lambasted for lacking depth (Burke). Walpole's \"The Castle of Otranto\" pioneered the Gothic genre by fusing older theatrical elements and modern literary techniques. It presented a new kind of storytelling that combined the 'old' and the 'new,' idealizing the past while offering a fresh perspective. The term 'Gothic' was used for different peoples, styles, and time periods, often seen as archaic or unsophisticated compared to the 'modern' advancements of literature and society. The Gothic's enduring appeal lies in its unique blend of theatricality and the novel's personal character exploration. Chivalry, a medieval concept, is a key theme in Gothic novels like \"The Castle of Otranto,\" embodying the ideal of a brave, honorable knight. Walpole, writing during a politically fraught time, may have seen a loss of the moral 'goodness' and innate 'goodness' represented by chivalry in his contemporary society. This is seen clearly in characters like Frederic, who exemplifies chivalric traits and is a romanticized ideal of a knight. Walpole's description of Frederic as a prince who has suffered tragedy and is assumed dead by infidels embodies this trope, with his gallant and courteous nature exaggerated to fit the Gothic trope of excess (66).",

This concept was coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who described it as a comprehensive process for planning, implementing, and controlling the supply chain to meet customer needs swiftly and efficiently. There are six pivotal components to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers leverage these components to deliver exceptional customer service.",
            "Adolf Hitler, it seems, is alive and well in Burma, according to a sign held by Ellen Page, the star of Juno. Burma, or Myanmar as it's known, is a Southeast Asian country under the grip of a ruthless military junta that seized power through a coup in 1962. In 2007, a series of street protests, dubbed the \"Saffron Revolution,\" erupted, led by monks. The protests initially saw peaceful gatherings, but escalated into violence as the military responded with force, invading monasteries and imprisoning foreign journalists, including a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai who was killed during a protest. Estimates of the death toll range from 13 to several thousand. This is not an isolated incident; throughout history, many regimes have sought to quash dissent and maintain total control. Egyptian pharaohs, Japanese emperors, and even our current president, George W. Bush, have been accused of such actions. Notable examples include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, the Rwandan genocide, and Adolf Hitler's 'Third Reich'.",
            "Duke Ellington’s influence on jazz can be attributed to his longevity and the way he crafted his orchestra. His piano presence is often subtle, but as a composer, Ellington excelled, writing intricate pieces that highlighted individual band members' skills. He created a framework for soloists to improvise freely, while also writing tightly orchestrated sections and phrases tailored to each player's unique style. This approach allowed him to emphasize the overall tone of the orchestra, creating cohesive and original sounds for each piece. Ellington’s ability to master individual players' sounds and how they worked together in a growing ensemble led to some of the most innovative and brilliant works in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music Dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative use of voice as an instrument. This is evident in Creole Love Call, where voice and reeds engage in a call and response, showcasing Ellington's talent for adding texture and color. The piece features a series of choruses, each with distinct soloists and orchestrations. The first chorus has a smooth, melodic voice transitioning to a rougher sound. The second features a muted trumpet solo elaborating on the basic melody with extended blue notes. A sweeping clarinet solo in the third chorus is backed by subtle syncopated piano. The fourth chorus has the full band echoing the first with a call and response by brass and reeds. The fifth chorus is climactic, with reeds in a high register and syncopated stop time from brass and rhythm sections. The sixth chorus returns to the first chorus' structure but with the voice using the \"growl\" technique. A vocal run and dissonant trombone ending complete the piece.\n\nEllington’s voice-as-instrument technique is a recurring stylistic trait throughout his work. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines tight orchestration with tone color. A call and response between Bubber Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) builds on this, with Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "She'd always felt an insatiable longing for something, a desire that hadn't been met. It began when she turned 14, just embracing her teenage life, and lingered into her 17th year. She'd come to realize she craved a person, not an item, but her interest in boys remained absent despite some being drawn to her. She puzzled over this strange condition, wondering what could ignite such an unusual reaction in a teenage girl. Despite years of contemplation, she found no definitive answers. So, she carried on, continually questioning her longing.\n\nA typical day at home was usually serene. Her parents were gentle and harmonious, never engaging in arguments with each other or their daughter. The only disputes were about her asserting her independence and vibrant personality, which made her quite likable. Her parents were as calm as could be, but she countered their energy with her lively spirit.\n\nToday was far from calm. As she meandered through the house, seeking inspiration for herself, she heard a sudden cry from the kitchen. Her mother's melodic voice echoed with pain. She rushed in, asking, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She found her mother on the floor, writhing in discomfort. \"Ow... sweet - ty, I ... need you to take me - to the hospital,\" her mother gasped. She rushed to her side, offering assistance. \"Okay, Mom, I'll pick you up. Tell me where.\" Her mother directed her to the car, and she carried her mother, grateful for her strength, to the vehicle.\n\nThe hospital was filled with antiseptic and tension, but her mind was solely focused on helping her mother. She rushed her in and called for help. Doctors quickly gathered and wheeled her mother to the examination area, leaving her to worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a step stool while reaching for a vase in the highest cabinet.",
            "This study aimed to demonstrate that sticking to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean diet score\" (aMed), is linked to a lower risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as reduced stroke mortality. The aMed diet is a tweaked version of the Med diet, featuring increased consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (but excluding potatoes, and including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (compared to saturated fats), and fish, along with decreased intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is also allowed.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that adhering to a Med diet is inversely associated with the risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality, and it was found to be more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering the total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio among obese individuals. However, these studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological research tracked 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, with no history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Every six years from 1984 to 2004, the authors calculated an aMed diet score using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake over the preceding year. More than 95% of the nurses continued participating throughout the 20-year period. FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed through medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, cases were considered \"probable\" and included, with around 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts thus classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and use of postmenopausal hormones were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed.\n\nTo minimize random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could mislead results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to examine the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile had lower risks for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In 2007, the United States of America faced a severe financial meltdown. Unemployment surged, the housing market tanked, and several major corporations were left in shambles. We must ponder: how did this catastrophe unfold, and how can we prevent it from happening again? In essence, the crisis was created by selfish and naive political choices that pressured banks and corporations into issuing sub-prime loans to an underdeveloped and insufficient financial system. Concurrently, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were coerced to underwrite and repack these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’s. When borrowers defaulted, the banks lacked capital reserves and transferred this turmoil onto the repacked mortgages they’d sold, and onto the broader economy.\nThe origins of this crisis can be traced back to 1999, during the Clinton administration's drive for a second term. To boost his popularity, Clinton relaxed lending restrictions, paving the way for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times in 1999 warned, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest mortgage underwriter, is under pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand loans to low and moderate-income individuals while feeling the pressure from shareholders to maintain its impressive profit growth.” Holmes accurately predicted the consequences: “But the government-subsidized corporation may face trouble in an economic downturn, requiring a government rescue similar to the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As foreshadowed, imprudent lending led to the economic collapse.\nSeveral factors contributed to the economic nosedive, one being the novel and intricate mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDO’s were widely used leading up to the crisis, further entangling the economy with the housing market. This over-leveraging left households and financial markets highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\nEventually, the housing bubble burst, leaving financial institutions that bought these mortgage-backed securities in disarray. The top five U.S. investment banks reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, representing about 30% of the USA’s GDP. Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a discount, Lehman Brothers was dissolved, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were compelled to become commercial banks under intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Exposition, that tricky beast, can be both your friend and foe in storytelling. It's where you dip your toes into the story, setting the stage or laying the groundwork for the adventure to come. Or, it's where your readers might lose interest and hit that \"Back\" button, cursing your name.\n\nDr. Merlin, our resident writing expert, has her own beef with exposition—when it's too much, it can be a snoozefest. She's had times where she's shouted at her monitor during those long passages where nothing happens, or where every minute detail of a character's life is laid out like an infomercial.\n\nExposition is the process of sharing information with the audience about what has happened or is going on. It's like the character who tells another character a detailed history, like in \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, the author is the one doing the storytelling.\n\nConsider this: you're reading a story where the heroine meets her beloved at a specific place and time, they wed in a grand affair, and then her husband is brutally murdered in front of her. The story takes pages to get to this point, and both characters barely speak. You'd expect more than that; you'd want to see how deeply they love each other, how his presence has transformed her life. You'd want to know about his mannerisms, his dreams, his hopes, and how his death impacts her.\n\nIn essence, you want meat on the bones of the story, not just a list of events: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, it's your job to provide that substance. It's tempting to rush over certain details, like introducing a new character who used to be in the Air Force, now runs a gas station, was married twice, loves fishing, and dreams of owning the station someday. While these details can be useful, they shouldn't be dumped all at once. Show us why these details matter, and how they shape the character and the story.",
            "I caught two news reports from Columbus, Ohio. The first was NBC 4, which aired live this morning on August 13, 2011. The top story was about a man named Shad Hostettler who had stabbed his wife, though they didn't mention her name. They showed his mug shot, and he looked menacing. This story got about two minutes of coverage, which seemed fitting for its developing nature. The next report was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, an 18-year-old who was critically injured in the Sharon Woods area. No arrests had been made yet, and the SWAT Team was investigate. This story seemed brief, possibly due to racial bias. I've long noticed that minorities often get less coverage when they're crime victims compared to white victims. The following story was about a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter, caused by a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers was offering a $5,000 reward for tips leading to the shooter's arrest. There was also a story about rain and thunderstorms expected for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to stay in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. They devoted a short amount of time to this, perhaps as a teaser to keep viewers tuned in. Another story was about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF, with a dark-skinned black man as the suspect. He was described as about six-foot tall and weighing around 150 pounds. They spent an unusual amount of time emphasizing his race and appearance. There was also a story about a convicted drug kingpin named Rene Rodriguez, who had conspired to distribute marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Instead of saying he was sentenced to 25 years, they said \"300\" months, which seemed strange. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, though this detail didn't seem relevant to the story.",
            "There's a bond between brothers, a bond that's unbreakable and irrevocable. This bond is filled with a mix of emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. Brothers understand each other deeply, almost as if they're mirror images of one another. It's during the toughest times that this bond becomes most apparent, showcasing both the good and the bad. When these emotions surface, they come with a heavy price. Part of understanding the emotions that stem from this fraternal connection is coping with the consequences that follow. By looking into a brother's eyes, one sees not just their reflection, but also their true self. Their actions and the outcomes of those actions reveal their genuine character. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers grapple with this theme and the intense emotions it entails. Amidst a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys embark on a doomed journey. In the climax, bitter disappointment and immense pride collide, with only one brother surviving. The theme is conveyed through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which delves into the protagonist's complex feelings and his view of the world, factors that heavily influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist’s actions are driven by a single emotion: pride. From their first adventure together to their final, fateful outing, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He had envisioned a brother who could learn all his skills, like holding his breath, running, or climbing the vines of Old Woman Swamp. He desired a brother to race to Horsehead Landing and to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn. But Doodle was born with a weak heart, making such activities unlikely. This dash of reality crushed the protagonist's dreams. Anger even brewed within him, as he contemplated suffocating Doodle with a pillow. Who could harbor such thoughts? Yet, his heart softened when Doodle smiled at him, instilling hope. This showed that his conviction wasn't strong. Deep down, he loved his brother.",
            "The brain, a marvel of complexity, is a creative information processor. As technology evolved from primitive to modern, so too did the metaphors used to describe it. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and now, most recently, to a computer. Keep in mind that while these metaphors are useful, they also have limitations and can lead to inaccurate conclusions.\n\nInformation processing commences with signals entering through the senses, which convert physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, or light into electrical signals. These signals are repeatedly processed by the brain in top-down and bottom-up ways. For instance, when gazing at an image of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing compiles basic details like color, orientation, and edges to deduce the presence of a box. Top-down processing then uses these findings to speed up recognition, perhaps helping you identify it as a black box instead of a white hole.\n\nOnce processed, an attention filter ranks the importance of the signal and determines which cognitive processes should act upon it. For example, while your brain processes every blade of grass as you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. However, you can pick out your name even in a noisy room. This multi-stage processing, with attention modulating the results repeatedly, allows the brain to function efficiently.\n\nFor information to be processed, it first needs to be stored. Various types of memory exist, including sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information is encoded in specific ways suited to each type of stimulus. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally (how the word looks), phonemically (how it sounds), or semantically (what it means). Once encoded, information must be maintained. Some studies suggest that working memory, storing info for about 20 seconds, does so through a brief electrical loop in certain neurons. Long-term memory is believed to be maintained by specific protein structures.\n\nNumerous models attempt to explain how knowledge is organized in the brain, drawing from how people retrieve memories, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that concepts are represented as nodes linked based on their relatedness. For example, in such a network, “chair” might link to “table,” which could connect to “wooden,” and so forth.",
            "Aldous Huxley takes a critical stand against the impending danger posed by technology and the capitalist system that supports it, as seen in his dystopian novel, Brave New World. The society values collective over individuality and is programmed from birth to prioritize instant gratification over any other pursuit. The people are essentially pawns in a larger scheme, subjected to a single ideology enforced by the World Controller. Through a Marxist lens, one can discern Huxley’s reservations about the rise of such systems. Terms like homogeny and reification, frequently used in Marxism, underscore the critique of emerging economic structures from Huxley's time.\n\nCapitalism is mocked through the Marxist concept of false consciousness, in which the common people are blinded to their true economic relations to other classes. This is due to ideological control over the proletariat and common laborers, evident in the conditioning of citizens in Brave New World. The lower classes, like Deltas and Gammas, have no true agency; hypnopædia instills a desire to consume, spend, and indulge, manipulated by the World Controller. Hegemony, the dominance of one social class over another, is clearly depicted. The lower classes are unaware of this manipulation, truly 'buying into an ideology that supports the structure' (i.e., capitalism and consumerism). The upper classes, born into awareness, do little more than accept their roles, save for a few Alphas or Betas like Bernard. Interactions among social classes further illustrate the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nIn Brave New World, individual relationships lack depth, with characters often indistinguishable from one another. Perhaps Huxley suggests that the rise of technology and capitalism together strip individuals of their free will and expression. Love and strong emotions don't exist, replaced by superficial interactions, particularly in the way males discuss women based on their physical attributes (like 'pneumatic quality') and females shamelessly share their encounters. Each class's complacence with their status indicates the socioeconomic effects of capitalism. Their unquestioning obedience to their role in society reflects Marxist thoughts on the proletariat, who are falsely reassured of their superiority through consumption and compliance with their peers.",
            "I've been a University Park student for nearly two and a half years, or around four and a half semesters. Navigating campus can be a challenge. My freshman year, I lived in East Halls, the farthest eastward campus residence, close to stadiums and the Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from Stuart Hall to classes in distant places like Willard building could take up to 25 minutes, especially in State College's harsh weather. Talking to an older alum revealed that East Halls used to be isolated by vast tracts of vacant land. Now, those empty spaces are filled with sports fields, new buildings, and apartments. As campus grows, traveling between places becomes tougher. The solution? Bikes. But bikes alone won't help; students must ride them, and the campus must be designed for cyclists. My friend, who resumed biking after a hiatus, found it the only efficient way to get around. Biking, combined with a bit of oatmeal and exertion, covers 30 miles easily. Like many students, I now live off campus, as distant from the center as some dorms. My smartest decision this year was buying a bike. Daily classes at Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from home, now take just 5 minutes on a bike. The catch? Pollock Road, the direct route, isn't always bike-friendly. While walking has its merits, I'm too busy to walk. Without a bike, walking would be my only option, adding 30-40 minutes to my daily routine, or over two and a half hours weekly. Add to that time spent walking to other classes and appointments, and it's more time than I can afford."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs.

            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",

To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle.

Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1).

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",

I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "In my journey towards becoming a social worker, I aim to serve the Division of Family and Children Services, assisting those who have endured abuse or neglect and supporting troubled families. The values that I can bring to the social work field include dedication, respect, and an unwavering commitment to improving relationships within families and continuously enhancing my professional competence. These core values aren't merely important for social workers; they are integral to who I am as a person.\n\nMy desire to help others has always been strong, but I was uncertain about the career path to follow. Throughout high school and college, I observed many individuals retreat from their problems in denial or resort to unhealthy coping mechanisms. These experiences guided me towards pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still undecided about my career, I took a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. One summer day, visiting a friend, I met a sixteen-year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. He was there to escape his abusive parents. The following day, I learned he had called the police to his parents’ house. I drove over to assist, explaining my concerns to the police and offering to speak with the parents, who seemed nervous and blamed their son for involving outsiders in disputes. This experience ignited my serious consideration for a career in social work to assist children in resolving family conflicts.\n\nMoreover, social justice is a crucial value in the field of social work. Society often claims the importance of the individual while mourning those lost, yet the concept of individuality we hold is often rooted in archaic traditions rather than uniqueness. If society mourns lost individuals, why do we strive to be similar to \"everyone else\"? I consider myself unique and reject societal limitations. Throughout my academic years, I stood against social injustice by expressing myself through unorthodox hairstyles, unconventional clothing, and piercings, and by actively participating in the GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance) and advocating against racism and discrimination. I remain committed to social justice and will continue to fight against injustice.",
            "This report delves into the Biological and Sociocultural frameworks related to the sleep disorder insomnia. The Biological model emphasizes genetic traits inherited from parents and the medical aspects of health. Meanwhile, the Sociocultural models consider environmental factors and their connections to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia examines these models and discusses the research selected to relate and explain them. The explanations of the research findings are then critiqued, highlighting their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized as primary, secondary, or associated with medical issues or substance intake. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, while secondary ones relate to mental disorders. Other categories involve medical complications or substance use. Dyssomnias include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia is characterized by trouble initiating or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is difficulty staying awake for at least a month. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/or automatic REM. Dyssomnias focus on sleep initiation and maintenance, whereas Parasomnias involve behavioral abnormalities and/or physiological occurrences, such as Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders related to mental disorders are linked to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review primarily focuses on insomnia and primary sleep disorders in relation to the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders explores genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired components. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice found that GABAB receptors on orexin neurons control sleep/wake states. Activating the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, and inhibiting it can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. GABAB agonists like baclofen increase sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). These mouse models indicate that genetic and environmental factors influence human sleep, possibly altering the GABAB receptor's function. This could affect sleep quality, impacting daily activities such as school, career, and monotonous tasks.",
            "This paper delves into three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), often called Auditory Processing Disorder (APD). It begins with a quick definition of the disorder, then moves on to diagnosis, highlighting common characteristics, or “red flags”. Lastly, it provides strategies for teachers in mainstream classrooms to help students with CAPD.\n\n\tCAPD, or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is defined as the efficiency and effectiveness with which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. To break it down, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies it. In simpler terms, it explains that the brain struggles to properly process sounds heard. People with CAPD can hear normally but have difficulty separating words or distinguishing conversation from background noise. It's not a hearing impairment but a brain function issue.\n\n\tThe earliest mention of this disorder dates back to the mid-1950s, referred to as “auditory imperception”. Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari started developing tests for children with communicative disorders in 1954. In 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception. The disorder gained more attention at a national conference held in 1977, which sparked research on children with CAPD.\n\n\tCAPD can manifest in various ways: individuals may struggle to localize or hear sounds in space, discriminate between sounds, recognize sound patterns, differentiate changes in speech, have sound synthesis difficulties, or determine the sequence of auditory information. No one tool or test consistently diagnoses CAPD, and its cause remains unknown. Diagnosis involves systematic observation of listening behavior and performance on tests of auditory function, conducted by audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others. Common tests present patients with multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli and ask for them to differentiate items like words or numbers. Advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals in the ear and measuring responses.",
            "The play \"Twelfth Night\" seems to assert that while disguise can be quite handy for deceiving others over extended periods, it's ultimately crucial to discard that new persona to prevent losing oneself forever. The challenge lies in ending such deception, as it might leave one feeling isolated. One must then choose between safeguarding their personal identity or maintaining relationships with others. While some may remain indifferent upon discovering a deception, others might find it repulsive and be offended by the entire charade.\n\nThe theme of deception in gender role reversal is quite complex, as it raises several questions. For instance, why does the individual feel compelled to forsake their own identity and adopt a disguise as the opposite gender? In Viola's case, it's clear she would rather protect herself from potential harm: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249) Arriving in an unfamiliar land, Viola dons a male disguise to shield herself from potential attackers. Her plan succeeds, yet it also isolates her from female company, disconnecting her from a vital support system. Worse still, her convincing portrayal of a man leads Olivia to mistake her for Sebastian and fall in love with her: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) Additionally, she must grapple with repressed romantic feelings towards Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\n\nToday’s readers might see \"Twelfth Night\" as an example of how deception can help uncover suppressed emotions, particularly in Olivia and Orsino's cases. Some passages hint that these characters may harbor unspoken desires that Viola/Cesario’s appearance forces them to confront. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because he appears to be a man, or does she secretly harbor feelings for females? It seems unlikely, as Shakespeare’s character Olivia appears more likely to be mocking the societal norms of his time, who judged others solely based on their appearance, as seen by the ease with which she shifts her affections from Cesario to Sebastian and considers Cesario/Viola as family: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)",
            "The German colonial rule's cruelty, particularly the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa, has been well-documented. However, it's inaccurate to label the entire colonial empire with a single description, as policies and governance varied greatly among colonies. Educational provision also differed significantly. When the British took over German East Africa, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also commended by contemporary authors. The situation in South West Africa was starkly different. Unlike East Africa, where the government played a significant role in educating natives through state schools, in South West Africa, the task was largely left to missionary societies with limited government backing. The government did invest heavily in European education, establishing state schools and supporting missionary schools. These policies had lasting effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies had many literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergent experience. This paper aims to explore these factors, focusing on new research into the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\nThere is extensive literature on education in the German colonial empire, much written in German and produced during or shortly after the colonial period. Early works primarily described the educational systems of these colonies. Later English works expanded on the discourse through comparative studies and detailed analyses. These studies highlighted significant differences across colonial educational systems. Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa is particularly relevant to this paper. He compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that explain their differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa is a significant factor in shaping the colony's educational system.\nSouth West Africa boasted a moderately temperate climate, with much of the territory covered by arid desert. This relatively hospitable environment led to a moderate European population. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, compared to just 5,336 in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "The classification of Popular Music has expanded over the past 100 years, encompassing so many genres that it's tough to list them all. To make matters more complex, nearly every genre—rap, rock, country, jazz, folk—has grown into numerous sub and sub-sub genres. Within the realm of Heavy Metal rock, this diversification has made it one of the most expressive and varied genres in popular music over the last 40 years. It's expressive due to its wide range of emotions, often leaning toward the dark side. It's diverse as well, as soon after its inception, musicians realized its flexibility and began creating their own sub-genres, followed by sub-sub-genres, continuing to this day.\n\nThe heavy metal scene has blossomed into a vast array of niches, making it hard to pin down what exactly qualifies as heavy metal. It has absorbed themes from various genres, but it all stems from a common origin. To truly grasp the metal music prevalent today, one must first understand the essence of the metal movement and why it's more than just a genre.\n\nMetal is, in many ways, a movement defined by darkness. It's a \"music of more\" — more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality, and less primitivism. Metal bands are known for their technical prowess, which shines through in their music. It's also a movement heavily influenced by drug use. The mid-70s psychedelic drug boom led to crazier and otherworldly records, using drugs as inspiration. This genre possesses dark, visceral qualities, a stark contrast to the lighter emotional tones in much of popular music. Later generations of metal musicians have drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral qualities of the Romantic Era. Lyrics like this from Helter Skelter by The Beatles exemplify this darkness and are considered one of the first heavy metal songs. The Beatles wrote it in response to a Rolling Stones song, aiming to prove they could be as heavy as their rivals. The song appeared on The White Album",
            "A few decades before the Surrealists started their dreamlike artwork, Henri Rousseau was already crafting his dreams, both literally and metaphorically. His famous 1910 painting, The Dream, doesn't just depict a woman in awe of the land in her dream; it also reflects Rousseau's personal dreams and aspirations as an artist. Rousseau longed for recognition, acceptance, and praise from other artists and art lovers, but faced an internal struggle: to conform to or mimic certain styles to gain acceptance or to forge his own unique path. The Dream is a prime example of this career-long dilemma.\n\nTo fully understand The Dream, you should know a bit about Rousseau's life. Born in Laval, northwest France, on May 21, 1844, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer who enjoyed a comfortable life. He had no formal art training and worked as a gabelou (municipal toll service employee), earning the nickname douanier (customs inspector). After the deaths of his wife and eight infant children, Rousseau turned to painting for solace and a new start. Unlike his contemporaries who romanticized the peasant in painting, Rousseau was a folk painter, representing the hopes and dreams of the average person.\n\nRousseau's desire for acceptance by the art world is understandable given his context: he was untrained, began painting late in life, and worked alongside many renowned artists. Recognition for his art came around the same time Matisse was gaining fame. Jan Gordon, in Modern French Painters, notes that while Matisse feared painting tritely and Rousseau desired conventionality to gain admission to the Artiste Français, their styles, subjects, and motivations differed greatly.",
            "Numerous wise individuals have pondered the deep connection between ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. I hold that at the core, there's a reason for this. As John Keats suggests in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While much of what we learn in life is through education or experience, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics without formal teaching. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe rather than dictate. Our studies of morality and beauty strive to explain why something is beautiful or moral, rather than providing rules for what is good art or moral behavior. Criticism of art or morals can't fully capture the essence of what is good or beautiful; it often ends with phrases like, \"There's just something about it,\" preceding a deeper explanation. I believe that both art and morals can't be fully reduced to their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor notes, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" In the same way, ethics has a transcendent quality, as Ludwig Wittgenstein says, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental.\" This ineffable \"something\" is the most powerful attribute of both ethics and aesthetics, linking them. I think morality and art are closely related because they impact us at a noumenal level, using a Kantian term—an experience that can be felt but not fully explained. This link is even stronger with literary art. As McKean points out, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Today's Germany is a powerful, united nation with a rich culture that spans from the hidden mountains of München up to the Baltic Sea's shore in Kiel. This cultural tapestry is also felt in cities like Köln along the Rhine, across the heart of Germany, and in the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. Given its diverse origins, it's no surprise that modern Germany is a blend of various tribes and sources.\n\nThe land known as Germania was once the ancestral home of the Germans. The etymology of the name is debated among scholars. Some argue it came from the Tungrian tribe, who were referred to as Germans before crossing the Rhine to clash with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Others suggest the name originates from the spear used in warfare, the \"ger,\" or from the Old Irish word \"garim\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans' loud nature. The earliest known use of the term \"Germanus\" was by Julius Caesar in his accounts of the Gallic Wars, where he distinguished the Germanic tribes from the Gauls (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC).\n\nThe first-century Roman historian Tacitus described the Germanic peoples as indigenous, not intermixed with other races. They had migrated to Germania by sea, not by land, drawn by its wild landscapes and inclement climate (Tacitus, 98). The Romans, while expanding their empire, often traded with and recruited Germanic tribes for their skilled warriors. However, the Romans rarely settled in Germania, preferring to return to their empire. As a result, many Germanic tribes lived on the empire's fringes, trading their goods and skills with the Romans (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).",
            "I stood, my mind a blank slate, as I stared at the scene before me. Unfeeling and detached, my consciousness, acutely aware of the image but not connecting it to any abstract thought, studied the picture at hand. Ideas darted in and out of my mind like a game of ping-pong, so swiftly and smoothly that it seemed I had no personal thoughts, only an active experience of what I was seeing. I had always wanted to draw, ever since I was a child, and a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" promised to teach me everything from recognizing a pencil to understanding how the brain interprets lines. The book advised placing a square frame around any picture to simplify it. At that moment, though, I was too overwhelmed to create that frame. I could only stand there, awestruck. Picasso's blue phase, Monet's love for greenery, and the Italian Renaissance masters' vibrant colors were overwhelming. I felt like I was at the beginning of my art journey, my first work, \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy fingers reached for my chosen tool, muscles tensing and relaxing as my hand moved through the air. My thoughts gave shape and form to the moment, a moment that could have been the most creative of my life. Water swirled, clear and calm. Pieces broke away and were lost in the process. My hand hit the toilet handle again, harder this time, but the offending brown package refused to budge, stuck like a slug. A few more flushes later, I found myself holding the toilet paper roll, wrapped around my hand like an oven mitt. I stood tall, then bent at the waist, my hand slowly dipping into the bowl, like a mother reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey....",
            "Teens are perishing behind the wheel, and it's a deadly combination of factors that's causing these grim statistics. The teen brain just isn't ready for the road's dangers, and inexperience amplifies this problem, leading to more fatal crashes, vehicle rollovers, speeding, and road deviations. Moreover, teens tend to drive with peers, which, as any sensible person knows, they do regularly. A study from the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center found a direct link between the age of passengers and the occurrence of traffic accidents.\n\nIn an effort to improve teen driving safety, several states have implemented provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and prohibit other minors as passengers. However, these are merely temporary solutions. The real issue is that, as a group, young drivers are not equipped to handle the risks and responsibilities of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman argues that 18 is still too young for a regular driver's license. USA Today reports that Zuckerman's research indicates a common desire among those under 19-20 to take risks for the thrill, which makes delaying driving until this tendency subsides a logical decision. If we continue to license young teens to drive, we'll see deadly accidents continue and the death toll may skyrocket in the coming years. By 2010, the Baby Boom generation's children will be eligible to drive, and millions of new teen drivers will hit the road.\n\nLegislation to address this issue could be simple. Schools could offer driver's education classes to start the learning process, but no one under 18 could operate a motor vehicle. Provisional permits could still be issued before a full driver's license, with a set number of practical driver's training hours required. The specific number of hours could be based on the majority of states' requirements (in California, it's 6 hours behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours with an adult). Since teen driving fatalities affect all states, uniform, national legislation would be a sensible and effective way to protect teens across the country.\n\nThe legislation I propose is not a novel idea.",
            "While sifting through the Library of Congress’s archive of early Edison films, I decided to take a look at all the trick films, totaling fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films often use clever editing to create illusions. My analysis mainly focused on the poetic elements of most trick films and identified some unique characteristics in a few of the later ones. Most trick films from this era are confined to a stationary stage, using a frontal proscenium, without camera movement, and relying on long and medium shots. They follow the one shot = one film method closely.\n\nOne striking similarity among these trick films is that they are shot within a static interior set, with the camera remaining fixed in its position, mirroring the stage or vaudeville tradition. This immobility often restricts actors to side-to-side movements without approaching or retreating from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors move back and forth horizontally, but the camera does not follow them.\n\nLong shots and, less frequently, medium shots are the norm, with close-ups being absent from all Edison trick films. This approach mimics early theatre and vaudeville practices, where the entire performance was visible within the stage's frame. Actors do not move towards the camera, making close-ups unnecessary.\n\nMany early trick films adhere to the one conceptual shot = one film rule, which limits their length to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second. This also restricts their narrative or dramatic content to brief vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic or disappearing acts. However, a single conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes can consist of multiple joined physical shots to create illusions. For example, in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a closer inspection reveals that the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” starts at a specific point, but the entire film is perceived as one continuous shot by viewers.",

His background as an agriculturalist and brief political career instilled in him a steadfast commitment to personal liberties and government policies.

            "Looking back at Figure 17, there was a steep decline in commuter log submissions during the third month of the project, which was quite disheartening. The reasons for this aren't entirely clear, but it could be attributed to the approach of winter in a New England campus, leading to a drop in bicycle and foot commuters. Additionally, December marks the end of the fall semester and the busy period of finishing schoolwork and processing grades, which might have caused log submissions to slip people's minds. The holidays also bring a month-long break for students and faculty, further reducing the need to commute to campus. Classes resume in late January, which may also explain the low number of logs for that month. It's worth noting that any project like this often experiences an initial burst of enthusiasm that may naturally wane over time. To counteract this, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which indeed led to an increase in log submissions for that month. One of the challenges we faced was maintaining project momentum despite natural declines in engagement and the impact of holiday and semester breaks on higher education. Another significant challenge was the cultural preference for driving cars, which provides freedom, independence, and flexibility. To incentivize alternative commuting methods, we offered various prizes such as gift certificates for local restaurants, coffee shops, a massage therapist, the local independent bookstore, and even some national chain stores. While the gift cards were sufficient at the project's start, offering larger prizes like bicycles, hybrid cars, or electric cars might have boosted participation and engagement. Increasing the value of prizes over time, perhaps announcing more substantial ones like a bicycle in December and a hybrid or electric car in January, could have potentially increased participation.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a financial tool that mimics an index, commodity, or a mix of assets, trading like a stock on an exchange. An ETF offers both the diversification of an index fund and the perks of single stock ownership, like short-selling, margin trading, and buying fractional shares. These advantages are compelling, but ETFs generally come with a lower expense ratio compared to mutual funds. However, there are drawbacks, such as trading commissions, similar to stock orders. Plus, ETFs provide a wide range of options. Yet, it's crucial for savvy investors to assess whether the stated benefits, like diversification, are real and to what extent. For this analysis, we'll examine the ETF IHF and compare its top 10 holdings to determine if owning a single ETF approximates the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks, and if there are better ways to configure these stocks for a better risk-return trade-off.\n\nTo manage the scope, we'll focus on the top 10 holdings, which hold 63.58% of the ETF's assets. Here's the list:\n\nTo gauge how well these top 10 stocks represent the ETF IHF, we'll calculate their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return, using their current asset percentages normalized to 100%. The results are shown below:\n\nThe chart reveals that a portfolio of just these top 10 holdings yields a 6.11% higher return and a 0.12 lower Beta than the ETF. This suggests that a portfolio of the top 10 holdings could offer higher returns and lower risk. However, these portfolios might not be statistically different from each other.\n\nTo confirm whether these portfolios are indeed different, we'll calculate the standard deviation of each top 10 stock and normalize it to 100% to compare their combined standard deviation with the ETF IHF's standard deviation.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe's \"Dream-Land\" is often hailed as one of his better poems. In this piece, Poe employs the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, a reference traced back to Virgil. Originally used by the Greeks to denote an island north of Britain, Thulé was considered the edge of the known world. While it's clear that Virgil utilized this term, a more contemporary source also merits consideration—Poe's affinity for German authors. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" notes the similarities between Poe's and Goethe's poems, concluding that Poe was indeed imitating Goethe.\n\nGoethe, a renowned German writer, is celebrated for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts: the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Goethe's death, 1832. Within the second part, a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé\" tells the story of a king who, after his wife's death, begins to drink heavily and eventually takes his own life. The parallels between the King of Thule and the speaker in \"Dream-Land\" are striking, particularly in their shared sense of loss and despair. A romantic drama adaptation of Faust by H.P. Grattan was published in 1842, just months before Poe's use of the term \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe references Thule twice in his collected works. In \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" he refers to \"ultma Thule,\" while in \"Dream-Land,\" he uses the term as bookends for the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes the landscape of Thule as dark, lonely, and haunted by the ghosts of his dead friends, mirroring the melancholic and bereft state of the King of Thule. The poem suggests that the speaker has stepped into Goethe's work.\n\nGoethe's influence on Poe is significant. Poe may have encountered Goethe's works through his admiration for Tennyson or through the numerous reproductions circulating after the original publications.",
            "Under California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\nA judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim outright. To justify punitive damages, a plaintiff must prove the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for probable harm, as well as demonstrating that the conduct was reprehensible. Palmer could argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill given multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping before her accident, yet he still neglected to clean it. While her claim about Martin’s actions being despicable is less forceful, it remains reasonable given the six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009 and Martin’s continued inaction to ensure store safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, informed his manager, Paul Martin, of an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin replied he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Mr. Martin about the spill. Martin responded similarly. At 5:30 pm on that day, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Before Palmer’s accident, five different slip-and-fall incidents had occurred at D&D’s in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering filing a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of a non-contractual obligation if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud, or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct intending to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have deemed conduct malicious when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "I took an Islam course at CBC four years ago, and the discussion on whether Islam is hostile was heated. This question is more pertinent today. The media's view of Islam and extremists shifted drastically after 9/11, from hostile to extremely tolerant, making it hard to imagine a president like Barack Obama, whose family has an obvious Muslim background. The Prophet Muhammad's biography intrigues me because it portrays him as a martyr, misunderstood and humble, rather than a conqueror who forced converts. This portrayal seems to overshadow the life of Jesus Christ and even implies that Muhammad was a sort of substitute. The biography also often presents 'witness' stories heard from third parties, which diminishes their credibility. I find it most concerning that the biography elevates Muhammad to an almost godly figure, contradicting historical accounts of his rise to power.",
            "The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were quickly abandoned in the evolution of Christian thought following his life. As we examine this history in broad terms, a pattern emerges where Christianity diverged further and further from its roots. The modern world seems to be increasingly aware and progressive. While traditionalists remain, their influence may not be sufficient to shape the whole. Among Christians, a historical consciousness will surely grow in the coming years. A desire will arise to distinguish the doctrines added to Christianity over time from Jesus' original intent. Though it may take decades or centuries, the outcome is unstoppable: Christianity will reverse its historical trend, returning to its original form. A movement will develop, peeling away layers of doctrine one by one, as if the clock were turning backward, leaving only the essence of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other philosophers made such claims. When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, encouraging millions to worship as they did in Jesus' time, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to guide the way. However, as the theological clock moves backward, the diverse proliferation of beliefs in Christendom will reverse into uniformity. Between regions, denominations, and divisions of every kind, we will see increasing similarities instead of differences. History is filled with such reversals. Consider how Christians were once persecuted, shunned, and killed by the Roman Empire, only to later have that empire become Christian. Our country has progressed from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The coming great reversal in Christian history will unfold, undoing history in search of its source and reversing diversity in the process. An important factor in making this possible will be interpreting Jesus' words metaphorically, not literally. So, what transpired since Jesus' lifetime?\n\nIf we delve deeply into history, we find only Judaism as the theological origin of Christianity. Monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were central to the religion by the time the Romans conquered Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population was not united in spirit. They split into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the majority of common people.",
            "I reckon The Jungle demonstrates that people, deep down, are inherently selfish and self-serving. They strive to make their lives the best they can without concerning themselves with those less fortunate. The novel underscores this through the owners and managers of the colossal factories. Their sole aim is to expand their empires, disregarding any obstacle, whether it's people or creatures, that might impede their progress. As Upton Sinclair writes, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This vivid imagery conveys the immense damage the pollution is causing, while highlighting the owners' callous disregard for anyone or anything harmed by their pursuits. They couldn't care less about the suffocating smoke pouring from the factories or the waste from the countless pens around Packingtown. Their apathy extends to their employees, whom they exploit mercilessly to increase profits. \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They subject workers to grueling hours and summarily dismiss them without compensation or job assistance, all while safety regulations were virtually nonexistent. Consequently, the hardships faced by those who perished in Packingtown were accepted as the norm, with no recourse or assistance available. Unions, intended to aid the workers, often ended up exploiting them further. The workers found themselves trapped in a system akin to slavery, forced into terrible living and working conditions, with no way out. As Sinclair eloquently puts it, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Many creators employ various methods to evoke specific feelings or attitudes in their readers towards significant themes. Some of these strategies are more potent than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes numerous techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald combines an adjective with a noun in an unconventional way to create a certain ambiance around a subject. Other times, he assigns meaning to a symbol and then employs it for the same purpose. Fitzgerald employs this latter technique with several colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In his novel, Fitzgerald builds up connotations for these colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, which he later uses to evoke feelings around important objects.\n\nFitzgerald assigns a meaning to white/gray, with white representing a higher class and gray symbolizing age and fadedness. He establishes this meaning early in the novel through repeated references to both colors. Daisy and Jordan are consistently \"in white\" (8), with everyone else wearing white, such as Nick in \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby's party, Tom in a \"white shirt\" (36) during his meeting with Myrtle, and Catherine in \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only deviation is when Nick observes Gatsby's party: \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further reinforces these colors by assigning them to mundane subjects: Nick's commute takes him \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the names of guests at Gatsby's parties are \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's schedule, Catherine's apartment is a \"slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses,\" and plain or common people and places are described as white or gray, such as Jordan and Daisy's \"white girlhood\" (19) together, the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"gray Italian child\" on the train (26), and the dog-seller, a \"gray old man\" (27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald infuses white/gray with sufficient meaning, he uses these colors to signify insignificance or uniformity around certain subjects. This technique begins with Daisy. After a prolonged absence of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster,\" making her seem less of a character and more like a uniform addition, something Gatsby desires and yearns for (74). Fitzgerald continues this technique around Daisy to convey her uniformity, such as the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18), and her appearance in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County is a farming powerhouse, thanks to its mild, sunny climate. Common crops here are tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There's a thriving market for organic, community-supported agriculture in the area, with long waiting lists for local organizations. Organic eggs and milk are also in demand. Many organic farms offer tours and recreational activities like hiking and birdwatching. This type of farming can take advantage of government programs to improve habitat, generate profit, and provide educational opportunities.",
            "Culture, in many ways, shapes and dictates the dynamics of any negotiation. It's a complex tapestry woven with threads of shared beliefs, traditions, and behaviors that can vary widely between and even within groups. A culture is not merely a homogenous entity; it's a multifaceted entity that can be understood just as much by what it is not as by what it is. Generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" oversimplify cultural nuances and can be misleading. While broad generalizations about a culture can be useful, a successful negotiator must understand the specific cultural context and how it influences the negotiation process.\n\nWhen engaging with a foreign culture, one often compares it to their own, leading to inevitable comparisons. This understanding can be gained through studying its history, customs, and even its biases. Instead of attempting to change or judge a culture, a negotiator should accept it for what it is and navigate it, especially when they hold a weaker position at the table. Respect for local traditions and beliefs can help in overcoming cultural barriers and advancing negotiations.\n\nIt's also crucial to recognize that culture isn't confined to national borders. Companies within the same nation can have distinct corporate cultures. For instance, one company might prioritize long working hours while another prefers a more flexible schedule. Signs of corporate culture can be seen in employee attire, communication styles (direct versus indirect), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy from employees, while others restrict it to approved causes. These differences can be as pronounced within the United States as they are across different regions and urban/suburban environments.\n\nValues are especially important to understand as they provide the 'why' behind a culture. If a culture values 'saving face' or 'communal harmony,' a negotiator will be cautious about publicly shaming an opponent to secure a deal. Similarly, if a culture values a hard-driven bargain, negotiations might be more tenacious. Knowing these values beforehand can significantly impact a negotiator's approach. However, understanding the personal background of the opposing negotiator can further enhance the effectiveness of the negotiation.",
            "The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’ This sentiment is first seen in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and is the foundation for St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. Similarly, this view is held by another author, Thomas Aquinas, who also defends this belief. Given our task is to compare these arguments, we must, for simplicity, assume they are both correct in their belief in God, specifically the God of the Bible. To contrast, we would not be able to compare their arguments effectively if we included a different type of God.\n\nWhile both authors present valid points, neither truly offers a comprehensive basis for belief in God. We will first examine St. Anselm’s argument. Anselm suggests that understanding God lies within one’s own mind, and that the proof for God is found by examining what we inherently know to be true. He implies that external evidence is unnecessary for this proof, which is often referred to as faith.\n\nThomas Aquinas, on the other hand, argues that God’s existence can be proven through reason and empirical evidence, negating the need for faith. This approach is beneficial for evangelism as it allows for logical persuasion of new converts without relying on their willingness to accept unprovable truths. Aquinas presents five logical arguments: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument demonstrates that the proof of God exists in the logical necessity of God.",
            "Around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince, who would later be known as Buddha, was born. Throughout his life, he abandoned the world and attained enlightenment, leading to the creation of Buddhism, with the most conservative branch being Theravada Buddhism. This religion emerged about 2500 years ago and has evolved significantly over time. For example, in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laypeople alike participate, though Buddha never taught about such a festival. These changes span from superficial traditions to the heart of the religion itself. Over time, the Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic and lay perspectives, has modified its core beliefs due to various internal and external factors, some hostile and others benign.\n\nSome key terms we'll use often include internal versus external forces. Internal forces are those originating from within the Buddhist community, regardless of monastic status. External forces are from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that harm or intend to harm the Buddhist community, often driven by a negative view of Buddhism. Benign forces do not intend to harm or help the community, but may still do so. These terms will appear frequently in this discussion.\n\nFirst, let's explore the basics of the religion—its core doctrines. Buddhists find refuge in the Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is composed of the Tripitaka, the three baskets of Buddhist scripture. The Sutta Pitaka includes all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines rules for conduct, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka covers the religion's metaphysical aspects. Key metaphysical concepts include Anatta (no-self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these concepts allows one to escape Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth. Along with this, lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) will cease when one becomes enlightened. The Vinaya Pitaka provides rules for laypeople and monks. Laypeople follow five key precepts: I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not engage in sexual misconduct, and I shall not consume intoxicating substances. Monks have many more rules to adhere to. The core doctrinal notion is the Four Noble Truths: First, that life is full of suffering (Dukkha). Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States of America and Mexico once shared a longstanding rivalry that lasted 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145). The height of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States successfully defeated Mexico and gained Texas and the American Southwest as new territories. There were numerous other skirmishes between the two nations, with tensions easing before the First World War.\n\nThis is not unique to the United States and Mexico. Many neighboring nations face similar rivalries due to shared borders. David M. Pletcher (1977) points out that \"only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting, overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Both Mexico and Cuba are geographically close to the United States and have historically been rivals, unlike other Latin American nations which have maintained good relations.\n\nReligious differences were a significant source of tension, a problem many nations have faced throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) notes that in the 18th and 19th centuries, Americans opposed Catholicism and monarchy, similar to the ideological struggles of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union (p.86). This distrust was inherited from the English and Spanish colonial rulers, making amiable foreign relations difficult to establish.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes during this 57-year period. Most of these involved territorial issues, including border raids from Mexican territory and other frontier problems. Bandits and outlaws from American border towns were a significant issue until both countries exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) explains that the rivalry began to ease as Mexico became significantly dependent on the United States and finally ended as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico in the later part of the 19th century (p. 109-110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, I found myself unexpectedly disabled by an ailment I had never heard of.

Despite my dream to be a scientist or journalist, perhaps a bit of both, I chose nursing. Now, here I am—46, single, with no savings and unable to work. I've been living on Social Security Disability for 15 years, and now I have nothing left to call my own. Every day is a struggle, an assault on my security, safety, and self-esteem.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do? Are there constraints that guide the course of evolutionary change? While D'Arcy Thompson, in 1917, mused that \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" this sentiment still holds true today. Recent studies have applied mathematical modeling to various aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis, both ontogenetically and phylogenetically (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our investigation explores how combining mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, along with experimental studies, can elucidate the mechanisms driving evolutionary-developmental shifts. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters, which were then modeled using the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We created hypothetical shell morphologies to interpret the limits of possible morphological changes in Prunum. These results are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to better understand macroevolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a tube that evolves through 360 degrees of space over time. These 360-degree turns are called whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis known as the columella. This columella runs through the central column of the shell. The rate at which whorls enlarge can vary, with a continuous line separating each whorl called a suture. Typically, the largest whorl of a shell is the last one, referred to as the body whorl. The spire is all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire, while the base is the opposite end. The animal exits its shell through an opening known as the aperture.\n\nShells can be examined from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. The \"usual\" orientation is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.\n\nTo count whorls, first view the shell from the apical perspective and determine where the first suture begins. Draw a line dividing the shell into two parts, then count the whorls from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures that evolve through time and space as the animal builds its shell. The trajectory of the aperture can be tracked using the coordinates of each whorl's aperture center, as well as its horizontal and vertical radius.\n\nThis trajectory can be represented graphically and mathematically. Once a mathematical formulation is established, parameters can be varied and modified to alter the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "The neonatal and infant mortality rates in Indonesia have not seen significant improvement over the past decade. Despite the country's progress towards several Millennium Development Goals, including water and sanitation targets, the progress in child and maternal health lags behind the 2015 goal. Reasons for this include inefficiencies in healthcare delivery and access issues. Indonesia has made strides in the number of births attended by skilled workers, with 72% meeting this target, but it includes traditional workers like midwives who lack medical intervention capabilities, which contributes to high maternal death rates. Additionally, there has been a decline in professional treatment of diarrhea cases in children under five, and postnatal care remains a concern with low rates nationwide. C-section rates remain low, at 4%, with urban rates at 7% and rural at 2%, highlighting healthcare disparities. There is also a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, indicating that the poor struggle more with healthcare access due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nIn considering how to address these issues, the primary question is whether Indonesia should focus on program-specific solutions or strengthen its overall healthcare system. While targeted programmatic approaches can yield faster results and have clear objectives, they may divert resources from other areas and lead to duplicated, uncoordinated services. For instance, heavy investment in HIV/AIDS programming has negatively impacted family planning efforts. Therefore, a balanced approach that addresses both the immediate challenges and the broader healthcare system is likely necessary.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their meticulous attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the era. Yet, two notable exceptions are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, which break from this mold with their mysterious elements and unique flair. Both works reveal the characters' inner selves, their pains, and their true nature, through these mysterious aspects, which are often depicted through dream sequences or dreamlike states. For instance, in Oliver Twist, such occurrences unveil insights into Oliver's inner turmoil, his awareness of his surroundings, and his lack of control over his fate. When Oliver relives the shooting vividly in chapter 28, it is as if he is in a dream, highlighting his inability to influence the events unfolding around him. The shooting is depicted as overwhelming, numbing his senses and leaving him with constant, dreadful pain linked to fear, rather than surprise. This dreamlike scene underscores Oliver's helplessness and the growing sense of defeat that he has been forced to accept, perhaps by the influence of Fagin. This reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over his own destiny. The passage also hints at a deeper mystery, raising questions about who or what caused his misfortune, as it was clearly not his own doing. This sequence emphasizes Oliver's inability to regain control of his life, even when it is on the line.",
            "A couple of years ago, I was working in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to assist them in their subjects, but my strengths were in English and reading. A fellow instructor recruited me to help a young boy named Adrian, who was having trouble reading. It was clear that something was off; he could pronounce some letters correctly, while others he got completely wrong, which was puzzling. Adrian was of Latino descent and spoke perfect English, but his reading was a struggle. We kept working on it until I met his mother during a babysitting session. She didn't speak a word of English, only Spanish. Despite my limited Spanish, we managed to communicate. It dawned on me then: Adrian could read fine, he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I'm not sure if my realization helped him much, but I hope he's doing better now. I share this story to highlight the language barrier in schools, especially in California, and to illustrate that it's not always as apparent as we think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English, reading can still be challenging. The problem is widespread, so what can we do? In Adrian's case, the solution was straightforward: tutoring in English reading, particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. However, for many children who barely speak English, the solution is much more complex. There's no single answer. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes—none of these alone will solve the problem. The key is to combine all these methods!",
            "From our childhood, many of us are taught that there's something greater than ourselves, something we can't grasp. Some of us are brought to Sunday school, while others visit temples or search within ourselves for understanding. Some readily accept the beliefs passed down by our parents, while others reject them, denying there's anything beyond our self-centered universe.

            "The classic \"Gothic Novel,\" as Ian Watt puts it in \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel,\" is an 'oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" blending the old and the new in both form and substance. The Gothic genre has been both celebrated and critiqued, praised for its 'terrible sublime' and lambasted for lacking depth (Burke). Walpole's \"The Castle of Otranto\" pioneered the Gothic genre by fusing older theatrical elements and modern literary techniques. It presented a new kind of storytelling that combined the 'old' and the 'new,' idealizing the past while offering a fresh perspective. The term 'Gothic' was used for different peoples, styles, and time periods, often seen as archaic or unsophisticated compared to the 'modern' advancements of literature and society. The Gothic's enduring appeal lies in its unique blend of theatricality and the novel's personal character exploration. Chivalry, a medieval concept, is a key theme in Gothic novels like \"The Castle of Otranto,\" embodying the ideal of a brave, honorable knight. Walpole, writing during a politically fraught time, may have seen a loss of the moral 'goodness' and innate 'goodness' represented by chivalry in his contemporary society. This is seen clearly in characters like Frederic, who exemplifies chivalric traits and is a romanticized ideal of a knight. Walpole's description of Frederic as a prince who has suffered tragedy and is assumed dead by infidels embodies this trope, with his gallant and courteous nature exaggerated to fit the Gothic trope of excess (66).",

This concept was coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who described it as a comprehensive process for planning, implementing, and controlling the supply chain to meet customer needs swiftly and efficiently. There are six pivotal components to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers leverage these components to deliver exceptional customer service.",
            "Adolf Hitler, it seems, is alive and well in Burma, according to a sign held by Ellen Page, the star of Juno. Burma, or Myanmar as it's known, is a Southeast Asian country under the grip of a ruthless military junta that seized power through a coup in 1962. In 2007, a series of street protests, dubbed the \"Saffron Revolution,\" erupted, led by monks. The protests initially saw peaceful gatherings, but escalated into violence as the military responded with force, invading monasteries and imprisoning foreign journalists, including a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai who was killed during a protest. Estimates of the death toll range from 13 to several thousand. This is not an isolated incident; throughout history, many regimes have sought to quash dissent and maintain total control. Egyptian pharaohs, Japanese emperors, and even our current president, George W. Bush, have been accused of such actions. Notable examples include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, the Rwandan genocide, and Adolf Hitler's 'Third Reich'.",
            "Duke Ellington’s influence on jazz can be attributed to his longevity and the way he crafted his orchestra. His piano presence is often subtle, but as a composer, Ellington excelled, writing intricate pieces that highlighted individual band members' skills. He created a framework for soloists to improvise freely, while also writing tightly orchestrated sections and phrases tailored to each player's unique style. This approach allowed him to emphasize the overall tone of the orchestra, creating cohesive and original sounds for each piece. Ellington’s ability to master individual players' sounds and how they worked together in a growing ensemble led to some of the most innovative and brilliant works in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music Dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative use of voice as an instrument. This is evident in Creole Love Call, where voice and reeds engage in a call and response, showcasing Ellington's talent for adding texture and color. The piece features a series of choruses, each with distinct soloists and orchestrations. The first chorus has a smooth, melodic voice transitioning to a rougher sound. The second features a muted trumpet solo elaborating on the basic melody with extended blue notes. A sweeping clarinet solo in the third chorus is backed by subtle syncopated piano. The fourth chorus has the full band echoing the first with a call and response by brass and reeds. The fifth chorus is climactic, with reeds in a high register and syncopated stop time from brass and rhythm sections. The sixth chorus returns to the first chorus' structure but with the voice using the \"growl\" technique. A vocal run and dissonant trombone ending complete the piece.\n\nEllington’s voice-as-instrument technique is a recurring stylistic trait throughout his work. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines tight orchestration with tone color. A call and response between Bubber Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) builds on this, with Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "She'd always felt an insatiable longing for something, a desire that hadn't been met. It began when she turned 14, just embracing her teenage life, and lingered into her 17th year. She'd come to realize she craved a person, not an item, but her interest in boys remained absent despite some being drawn to her. She puzzled over this strange condition, wondering what could ignite such an unusual reaction in a teenage girl. Despite years of contemplation, she found no definitive answers. So, she carried on, continually questioning her longing.\n\nA typical day at home was usually serene. Her parents were gentle and harmonious, never engaging in arguments with each other or their daughter. The only disputes were about her asserting her independence and vibrant personality, which made her quite likable. Her parents were as calm as could be, but she countered their energy with her lively spirit.\n\nToday was far from calm. As she meandered through the house, seeking inspiration for herself, she heard a sudden cry from the kitchen. Her mother's melodic voice echoed with pain. She rushed in, asking, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She found her mother on the floor, writhing in discomfort. \"Ow... sweet - ty, I ... need you to take me - to the hospital,\" her mother gasped. She rushed to her side, offering assistance. \"Okay, Mom, I'll pick you up. Tell me where.\" Her mother directed her to the car, and she carried her mother, grateful for her strength, to the vehicle.\n\nThe hospital was filled with antiseptic and tension, but her mind was solely focused on helping her mother. She rushed her in and called for help. Doctors quickly gathered and wheeled her mother to the examination area, leaving her to worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a step stool while reaching for a vase in the highest cabinet.",
            "This study aimed to demonstrate that sticking to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean diet score\" (aMed), is linked to a lower risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as reduced stroke mortality. The aMed diet is a tweaked version of the Med diet, featuring increased consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (but excluding potatoes, and including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (compared to saturated fats), and fish, along with decreased intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is also allowed.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that adhering to a Med diet is inversely associated with the risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality, and it was found to be more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering the total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio among obese individuals. However, these studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological research tracked 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, with no history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Every six years from 1984 to 2004, the authors calculated an aMed diet score using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake over the preceding year. More than 95% of the nurses continued participating throughout the 20-year period. FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed through medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, cases were considered \"probable\" and included, with around 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts thus classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and use of postmenopausal hormones were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed.\n\nTo minimize random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could mislead results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to examine the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile had lower risks for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In 2007, the United States of America faced a severe financial meltdown. Unemployment surged, the housing market tanked, and several major corporations were left in shambles. We must ponder: how did this catastrophe unfold, and how can we prevent it from happening again? In essence, the crisis was created by selfish and naive political choices that pressured banks and corporations into issuing sub-prime loans to an underdeveloped and insufficient financial system. Concurrently, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were coerced to underwrite and repack these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’s. When borrowers defaulted, the banks lacked capital reserves and transferred this turmoil onto the repacked mortgages they’d sold, and onto the broader economy.\nThe origins of this crisis can be traced back to 1999, during the Clinton administration's drive for a second term. To boost his popularity, Clinton relaxed lending restrictions, paving the way for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times in 1999 warned, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest mortgage underwriter, is under pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand loans to low and moderate-income individuals while feeling the pressure from shareholders to maintain its impressive profit growth.” Holmes accurately predicted the consequences: “But the government-subsidized corporation may face trouble in an economic downturn, requiring a government rescue similar to the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As foreshadowed, imprudent lending led to the economic collapse.\nSeveral factors contributed to the economic nosedive, one being the novel and intricate mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDO’s were widely used leading up to the crisis, further entangling the economy with the housing market. This over-leveraging left households and financial markets highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\nEventually, the housing bubble burst, leaving financial institutions that bought these mortgage-backed securities in disarray. The top five U.S. investment banks reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, representing about 30% of the USA’s GDP. Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a discount, Lehman Brothers was dissolved, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were compelled to become commercial banks under intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Exposition, that tricky beast, can be both your friend and foe in storytelling. It's where you dip your toes into the story, setting the stage or laying the groundwork for the adventure to come. Or, it's where your readers might lose interest and hit that \"Back\" button, cursing your name.\n\nDr. Merlin, our resident writing expert, has her own beef with exposition—when it's too much, it can be a snoozefest. She's had times where she's shouted at her monitor during those long passages where nothing happens, or where every minute detail of a character's life is laid out like an infomercial.\n\nExposition is the process of sharing information with the audience about what has happened or is going on. It's like the character who tells another character a detailed history, like in \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, the author is the one doing the storytelling.\n\nConsider this: you're reading a story where the heroine meets her beloved at a specific place and time, they wed in a grand affair, and then her husband is brutally murdered in front of her. The story takes pages to get to this point, and both characters barely speak. You'd expect more than that; you'd want to see how deeply they love each other, how his presence has transformed her life. You'd want to know about his mannerisms, his dreams, his hopes, and how his death impacts her.\n\nIn essence, you want meat on the bones of the story, not just a list of events: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, it's your job to provide that substance. It's tempting to rush over certain details, like introducing a new character who used to be in the Air Force, now runs a gas station, was married twice, loves fishing, and dreams of owning the station someday. While these details can be useful, they shouldn't be dumped all at once. Show us why these details matter, and how they shape the character and the story.",
            "I caught two news reports from Columbus, Ohio. The first was NBC 4, which aired live this morning on August 13, 2011. The top story was about a man named Shad Hostettler who had stabbed his wife, though they didn't mention her name. They showed his mug shot, and he looked menacing. This story got about two minutes of coverage, which seemed fitting for its developing nature. The next report was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, an 18-year-old who was critically injured in the Sharon Woods area. No arrests had been made yet, and the SWAT Team was investigate. This story seemed brief, possibly due to racial bias. I've long noticed that minorities often get less coverage when they're crime victims compared to white victims. The following story was about a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter, caused by a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers was offering a $5,000 reward for tips leading to the shooter's arrest. There was also a story about rain and thunderstorms expected for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to stay in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. They devoted a short amount of time to this, perhaps as a teaser to keep viewers tuned in. Another story was about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF, with a dark-skinned black man as the suspect. He was described as about six-foot tall and weighing around 150 pounds. They spent an unusual amount of time emphasizing his race and appearance. There was also a story about a convicted drug kingpin named Rene Rodriguez, who had conspired to distribute marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Instead of saying he was sentenced to 25 years, they said \"300\" months, which seemed strange. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, though this detail didn't seem relevant to the story.",
            "There's a bond between brothers, a bond that's unbreakable and irrevocable. This bond is filled with a mix of emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. Brothers understand each other deeply, almost as if they're mirror images of one another. It's during the toughest times that this bond becomes most apparent, showcasing both the good and the bad. When these emotions surface, they come with a heavy price. Part of understanding the emotions that stem from this fraternal connection is coping with the consequences that follow. By looking into a brother's eyes, one sees not just their reflection, but also their true self. Their actions and the outcomes of those actions reveal their genuine character. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers grapple with this theme and the intense emotions it entails. Amidst a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys embark on a doomed journey. In the climax, bitter disappointment and immense pride collide, with only one brother surviving. The theme is conveyed through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which delves into the protagonist's complex feelings and his view of the world, factors that heavily influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist’s actions are driven by a single emotion: pride. From their first adventure together to their final, fateful outing, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He had envisioned a brother who could learn all his skills, like holding his breath, running, or climbing the vines of Old Woman Swamp. He desired a brother to race to Horsehead Landing and to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn. But Doodle was born with a weak heart, making such activities unlikely. This dash of reality crushed the protagonist's dreams. Anger even brewed within him, as he contemplated suffocating Doodle with a pillow. Who could harbor such thoughts? Yet, his heart softened when Doodle smiled at him, instilling hope. This showed that his conviction wasn't strong. Deep down, he loved his brother.",
            "The brain, a marvel of complexity, is a creative information processor. As technology evolved from primitive to modern, so too did the metaphors used to describe it. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and now, most recently, to a computer. Keep in mind that while these metaphors are useful, they also have limitations and can lead to inaccurate conclusions.\n\nInformation processing commences with signals entering through the senses, which convert physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, or light into electrical signals. These signals are repeatedly processed by the brain in top-down and bottom-up ways. For instance, when gazing at an image of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing compiles basic details like color, orientation, and edges to deduce the presence of a box. Top-down processing then uses these findings to speed up recognition, perhaps helping you identify it as a black box instead of a white hole.\n\nOnce processed, an attention filter ranks the importance of the signal and determines which cognitive processes should act upon it. For example, while your brain processes every blade of grass as you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. However, you can pick out your name even in a noisy room. This multi-stage processing, with attention modulating the results repeatedly, allows the brain to function efficiently.\n\nFor information to be processed, it first needs to be stored. Various types of memory exist, including sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information is encoded in specific ways suited to each type of stimulus. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally (how the word looks), phonemically (how it sounds), or semantically (what it means). Once encoded, information must be maintained. Some studies suggest that working memory, storing info for about 20 seconds, does so through a brief electrical loop in certain neurons. Long-term memory is believed to be maintained by specific protein structures.\n\nNumerous models attempt to explain how knowledge is organized in the brain, drawing from how people retrieve memories, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that concepts are represented as nodes linked based on their relatedness. For example, in such a network, “chair” might link to “table,” which could connect to “wooden,” and so forth.",
            "Aldous Huxley takes a critical stand against the impending danger posed by technology and the capitalist system that supports it, as seen in his dystopian novel, Brave New World. The society values collective over individuality and is programmed from birth to prioritize instant gratification over any other pursuit. The people are essentially pawns in a larger scheme, subjected to a single ideology enforced by the World Controller. Through a Marxist lens, one can discern Huxley’s reservations about the rise of such systems. Terms like homogeny and reification, frequently used in Marxism, underscore the critique of emerging economic structures from Huxley's time.\n\nCapitalism is mocked through the Marxist concept of false consciousness, in which the common people are blinded to their true economic relations to other classes. This is due to ideological control over the proletariat and common laborers, evident in the conditioning of citizens in Brave New World. The lower classes, like Deltas and Gammas, have no true agency; hypnopædia instills a desire to consume, spend, and indulge, manipulated by the World Controller. Hegemony, the dominance of one social class over another, is clearly depicted. The lower classes are unaware of this manipulation, truly 'buying into an ideology that supports the structure' (i.e., capitalism and consumerism). The upper classes, born into awareness, do little more than accept their roles, save for a few Alphas or Betas like Bernard. Interactions among social classes further illustrate the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nIn Brave New World, individual relationships lack depth, with characters often indistinguishable from one another. Perhaps Huxley suggests that the rise of technology and capitalism together strip individuals of their free will and expression. Love and strong emotions don't exist, replaced by superficial interactions, particularly in the way males discuss women based on their physical attributes (like 'pneumatic quality') and females shamelessly share their encounters. Each class's complacence with their status indicates the socioeconomic effects of capitalism. Their unquestioning obedience to their role in society reflects Marxist thoughts on the proletariat, who are falsely reassured of their superiority through consumption and compliance with their peers.",
            "I've been a University Park student for nearly two and a half years, or around four and a half semesters. Navigating campus can be a challenge. My freshman year, I lived in East Halls, the farthest eastward campus residence, close to stadiums and the Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from Stuart Hall to classes in distant places like Willard building could take up to 25 minutes, especially in State College's harsh weather. Talking to an older alum revealed that East Halls used to be isolated by vast tracts of vacant land. Now, those empty spaces are filled with sports fields, new buildings, and apartments. As campus grows, traveling between places becomes tougher. The solution? Bikes. But bikes alone won't help; students must ride them, and the campus must be designed for cyclists. My friend, who resumed biking after a hiatus, found it the only efficient way to get around. Biking, combined with a bit of oatmeal and exertion, covers 30 miles easily. Like many students, I now live off campus, as distant from the center as some dorms. My smartest decision this year was buying a bike. Daily classes at Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from home, now take just 5 minutes on a bike. The catch? Pollock Road, the direct route, isn't always bike-friendly. While walking has its merits, I'm too busy to walk. Without a bike, walking would be my only option, adding 30-40 minutes to my daily routine, or over two and a half hours weekly. Add to that time spent walking to other classes and appointments, and it's more time than I can afford."
