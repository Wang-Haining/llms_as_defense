            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "While pursuing my education in social work, I've found myself drawn to a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services, where I hope to make a difference in the lives of children who've been victimized or neglected, as well as offer support to families in crisis. As I delve deeper into this field, I've come to realize that the values I bring to the table – service, respect, and an unwavering commitment to ethics – are not only essential to the social work profession, but also deeply personal to me. I've always been driven to help others, though I've struggled to pinpoint the perfect career path. Throughout high school and college, I watched as people dodged their problems or employed coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. As I navigated this uncertainty, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, but even that didn't provide the clarity I was seeking.\n\nA pivotal moment arrived when I spent the summer after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. I visited a friend, and she introduced me to a 16-year-old boy who was anxious and skittish on her couch. She explained that he had come to escape his abusive parents, and the next day, I learned he'd called the police to their residence. Feeling compelled to act, I drove to his parents' house, where I discreetly discussed my concerns with the authorities and revealed my recent psychology degree. The police asked me to speak with the parents since there was little they could do for the teenager. As I questioned them, they seemed evasive and made excuses for their son's behavior, labeling it as \"manipulative\" and a \"simple dispute.\" This experience jarred me into seriously considering a career in social work, particularly in helping children navigate family conflicts.\n\nSocial justice is another fundamental value that resonates deeply within me. As a society, we tout individuality, yet often prioritize conformity. We mourn those we've lost, yet strive to be like everyone else. I'm an individual, and I refuse to conform to societal expectations. Throughout high school and college, I consistently spoke out against social injustice – through bold fashion choices, declarations of support for the GSBA, and fighting against racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it. I believe in the power of social justice and will continue to challenge the status quo.",
            "The relationship between insomnia and its underlying causes is a multifaceted issue that can be approached through two distinct models: the biological and sociocultural models. While the biological model delves into the genetic and physiological aspects of sleep disorders, the sociocultural model examines the environmental factors that influence an individual's sleep patterns. In this review, we will delve into the intricacies of insomnia, exploring the various categories of sleep disorders and how they relate to these two models. We will also critique the research that supports each model, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nInsomnia can manifest in different forms, including primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders linked to mental health issues, and sleep disorders caused by medical complications or substance use. Within the primary sleep disorders category, we find the Dyssomnias, which encompass a range of conditions, including Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia is characterized by difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is marked by excessive daytime sleepiness. Narcolepsy, on the other hand, is associated with cataplexy and automatic REM sleep.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders focuses on the genetic and physiological factors that influence sleep patterns. Research has shown that the hypothalamus, a region in the brain, plays a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for this regulation, and studies have discovered that the activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while its inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and increased sleep time. For instance, a study involving mice found that the activation of the GABAB receptors on orexin neurons can induce sleep, and the use of the GABAB agonist, baclofen, increased sleep time. These findings suggest that there is a genetic basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans, and alterations in this receptor can impact an individual's ability to sleep without medication.\n\nThe sociocultural implications of this research are significant, as they suggest that inherited genetic traits can influence an individual's sleep patterns. If an individual inherits a phenotype that affects the GABAB receptor, it could naturally disrupt their sleep, leading to problems in various aspects of life, such as school, career, and daily tasks that require focus. This highlights the importance of considering both biological and sociocultural factors when understanding and addressing insomnia.",
            "I'm still trying to wrap my head around Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It's a condition that affects how the central nervous system processes what we hear. Simply put, it's not that people with CAPD can't hear, but their brains have trouble making sense of the sounds they pick up. It's like having a radio that receives the signal, but the dial is stuck on static – the brain's ability to distinguish words, conversations, and background noise is all over the place.\n\nCAPD has been around since the 1950s, when researchers first identified it as \"auditory imperception.\" The Italian team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari developed the first tests for kids with communication disorders back in 1954. Fast forward to the 1970s, and a national conference sparked a wave of research into CAPD.\n\nSo, what does CAPD look like in action? Some people might struggle to pinpoint where sounds are coming from, while others might have trouble telling two sounds apart. They might not be able to recognize patterns or differentiate between changes in speech, like when someone's voice changes tone to indicate sarcasm. Imagine trying to decipher a code without the decoder ring – it's like that. And if one sound gets drowned out by another, it's like trying to hear a whisper in a busy restaurant.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, professionals like audiologists and speech-language pathologists use a combination of observation and testing. They might give patients questionnaires, observe their reactions to different stimuli, or even record the electrical signals in the ear to see how the brain responds. It's a complex process, and there's no single test that stands out as a clear winner. The unknown cause of CAPD only adds to the mystery.\n\nAs a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom, it's essential to be aware of the red flags that might indicate a student has CAPD. By being attuned to these cues, you can provide extra support and create a more inclusive learning environment. It's all about being sensitive to the ways CAPD can affect a student's ability to learn and succeed.",
            "It seems that Shakespeare's Twelfth Night conveys the idea that while disguising oneself can facilitate deception on a grand scale, ultimately, embracing one's true self is essential to avoid losing oneself in the process. One of the challenges in shedding a disguise, however, lies in the risk of alienating those around us. In some cases, people may react with indifference to being deceived, while others, understandably, might take offense to the charade. This raises the question of prioritizing one's own identity versus preserving relationships with others. \n\nGender role reversal, in particular, adds a layer of complexity, as it prompts us to ponder the motivations behind such a disguise. Take Viola, for instance, who dons a masculine guise to safeguard herself in a foreign land. Her ruse works, but it also isolates her from her female support system and, as it turns out, even causes her to be mistaken for Sebastian, leading Olivia to fall for her. Viola also grapples with suppressed feelings for Orsino, whose words suggest a hidden attraction to her. \n\nIn a way, Twelfth Night can be seen as a commentary on how deception can unveil repressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. The play hints that these characters might be harboring unconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to confront. The ease with which Olivia moves from infatuation with Cesario to a familial bond with Viola suggests that Olivia is more likely parodying the shallow judgments of her contemporaries, who often rely on surface-level appearances.",
            "I've witnessed firsthand the brutal legacy of German colonial rule, especially in its brutal treatment of the Ovaherero and Nama in what is now Namibia. However, no single phrase can encapsulate the complexities of a sprawling colonial empire. Just as the terrain varied, so did the policies and ruling styles of the German colonial empire. Educational provisions across the colonies were as diverse as the lands they occupied. When the British took over Tanganyika, they found a population of educated and literate Africans, a stark contrast to the situation in other colonies.\n\nIn South West Africa, however, the government abdicated its responsibility for native education, leaving most of it to underfunded missionary societies. Meanwhile, they lavished resources on European education, establishing state schools and tightly regulating missionary institutions. This disjointed approach had far-reaching consequences for the region, even long after German rule. While other colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, South West Africa remained largely untouched, uneducated, and illiterate. What drove this divergent experience? This essay seeks to shed more light on this issue by examining the complex interplay of social, political, and economic factors.\n\nThe existing literature on German colonial education is vast and mostly written in German, with many works dating back to the early twentieth century. These early studies mostly focused on describing the educational systems in place. Later studies, written in English, delved deeper, comparing education systems across colonies and analyzing specific aspects in greater detail. Notably, Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa laid the groundwork for this discussion. By comparing the two colonies, Cohen identified the significant differences in their educational systems, attributing many of them to the large settler population in South West Africa.\n\nSouth West Africa's climate was relatively mild, albeit with vast expanses of arid desert. This relatively hospitable environment attracted a sizeable settler population. By 1913, nearly 15,000 Europeans called South West Africa home, far outpacing the 5,336 settlers in East Africa, the next largest colony.",
            "Fast forward a century, and the landscape of popular music has undergone a seismic shift, with genres mushrooming like weeds in a fertile field. It's a daunting task to pin down every single one of them, and the situation is further complicated by the fact that most popular genres – think rap, rock, country, jazz, folk – have given birth to their own mini-genres within their domain. But if there's one genre that's taken the cake for diversity and expressiveness, it's Heavy Metal, which has evolved over the past four decades into a behemoth of a genre that's as dark as it is bold.\n\nThe beauty of Heavy Metal lies in its chameleon-like ability to adapt and transform, giving birth to an endless array of sub-genres and sub-sub-genres that continue to sprout and grow. Today, with the genre having become a vast, sprawling entity, it's tricky to pinpoint exactly what constitutes Heavy Metal. This is because it's incorporated elements from other genres, yet its roots are firmly planted in a particular tradition. To truly understand the Heavy Metal phenomenon, we need to delve into its core, exploring what makes it a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nAt its heart, Metal is a genre defined by its affinity for the darker side of life. It's music that's loud, raw, and unapologetic, often incorporating elements of the dramatic and the theatrical. Bands that make Metal music are known for their technical prowess, with musicianship that's polished and refined. And let's be honest – Metal has long had a reputation for being a genre that's heavily influenced by substances that alter the mind. The psychedelic boom of the 1970s led to a proliferation of records that were truly out of this world, with musicians using their experiences under the influence as a creative wellspring.\n\nMetal's visceral qualities are a major part of its appeal, offering a sonic landscape that's often bleak and unflinching. This was a radical departure from the more upbeat, feel-good music that dominated the airwaves in the past. Later generations of Metal musicians drew inspiration from the Romantic Era's emphasis on the darker, more intense aspects of human experience. Lyrics like those found in Helter Skelter, often cited as one of the first Heavy Metal songs, perfectly capture the genre's affinity for the shadows. This Beatles' classic, with its moods that swing wildly between euphoria and despair, showcases the darker side of human emotion, a staple of the Metal movement.",
            "I still get a kick out of thinking about the early days of Surrealism, when artists like those associated with the movement started crafting their dreamlike masterpieces. But there was one artist who was actually painting his dreams – literally and figuratively – years before the Surrealists came on the scene. I'm talking about Henri Rousseau, a Post-Impressionist master who created The Dream in 1910, a painting that not only showcases a woman in awe of the wonders of a dreamland but also reveals Rousseau's own aspirations and struggles as an artist.\n\nRousseau's dream was to be recognized, accepted, and praised by his peers and the art world. But he found himself torn between conforming to the styles of the time to gain acceptance and staying true to his unique vision. This internal conflict is the very essence of The Dream, a work that reflects Rousseau's lifelong struggle to balance his desire for artistic individuality with the pressure to conform to the expectations of the art world.\n\nTo truly understand the significance of The Dream, you need to know a bit about Rousseau's backstory. Born on May 21, 1844, in the French town of Laval, Rousseau grew up in a relatively affluent family – his father was a prosperous tinsmith and hardware dealer. However, he didn't receive any formal art training, and instead, worked as a municipal toll collector until he was forty. But art was his true passion, and after his first wife's untimely death, which was followed by the loss of eight infant children, he turned to painting as a way to cope with his grief and find a new sense of purpose.\n\nUnlike many of his contemporaries, who romanticized and sentimentalized the peasant class in their art, Rousseau was a folk painter who created works that reflected the hopes and dreams of the average working-class person. Given his late start in life and the fact that he was producing art alongside more established artists, it's no wonder that Rousseau felt pressure to be accepted by the art world. He didn't gain widespread recognition until around the same time that Matisse was starting to make a name for himself. As art historian Jan Gordon noted, while Matisse was driven by a desire to avoid painting in a mundane way, Rousseau's goal was to create conventionally beautiful works that would earn him a spot in the prestigious Artiste Français.",
            "Throughout history, great thinkers have been insistent on the deep connection between ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. I believe there's a profound reason behind this. As John Keats so eloquently put it in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty— That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Our understanding of the world is largely shaped by education and experience, yet we somehow instinctively grasp the value of ethics and aesthetics, as Keats suggests. Both ethics and aesthetics are about describing, not prescribing. Our studies of morality and beauty are essentially attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than providing a set of rigid rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nTo put it more directly, criticism of art or morals can never fully capture the essence of what's good or beautiful. Discussions about the worth of the Mona Lisa, for example, might revolve around concepts like composition, contrast, or cultural context, but ultimately, these don't explain why it's good art. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often respond with a phrase like, \"There's just something about it,\" followed by a more intricate or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be reduced to a simple description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor astutely observed, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we describe the properties of a work of literature, there's always something left unspoken. Similarly, I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein noted, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I propose that it's this \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, which makes art and morality so powerful, and that their transcendental nature provides a common ground between them.\n\nI believe that morality and art are closely linked because we experience both most intensely at a fundamental, noumenal level, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be felt, but not fully explained. This connection is even stronger when it comes to literature. As McKean points out, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany's unity is what makes it a force to be reckoned with today. From the shadows of the Alps in München to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel, the country boasts a unique culture that's a blend of its diverse heritage. This cultural fusion can be felt throughout, from the Rhine River city of Köln to the heart of Germany, all the way to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. Given its rich history, it's no surprise that modern Germany is a melting pot of various cultures and tribes.\n\nThe birthplace of the Germans is known as Germania, but its origins are shrouded in mystery. Historians and scholars are still debating the name's roots. Tacitus believed it stemmed from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were previously known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and clashed with the Gauls. Julius Caesar, on the other hand, used the term \"Germanus\" in his account of the Gallic Wars, where he battled the Gauls and Germanic tribes that often crossed the Rhine with a mischievous agenda. Caesar coined this term from the Gauls themselves, using it to differentiate between the conquered Gauls and the unconquered Germanic tribes. In his first book, Caesar notes, \"The Germans, who live beyond the Rhine, continually wage war with the Gauls.\" Some theorize that the name \"German\" comes from the Gaulish language, while others propose it derived from the spear used in warfare, known as a ger. Another theory suggests it originated from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" possibly indicating the Germans were loud and boisterous.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus, in his 98 AD writing \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" provides insight into the origins of the Germans, describing them as aboriginal and unadulterated by other cultures. He writes, \"Who would leave Asia or Africa for Italy, for Germany with its harsh climate, unforgiving skies, and rough demeanor, unless it were their homeland?\" The Romans, at least initially, showed little interest in settling in Germany, preferring to conquer and trade with the Germanic tribes instead. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they lived on the fringes of the Roman Empire, exchanging goods and skills with the Romans, who valued their military prowess and services within the Roman army.",
            "I stood blankly in front of the toilet, my mind a complete blank slate. Thoughts ping-ponged through my brain, but nothing stuck. It was as if I'd become a vessel for the visual landscape before me, a mere observer detached from my own thoughts. My consciousness whirled through the scene like water, effortlessly flowing from one moment to the next. The image of the offending brown package in the toilet bowl stared me down, but I didn't feel a thing. It was almost as if I'd disconnected from my own emotions, observing the world with a practiced lack of attachment.\n\nI used to be fascinated by art, ever since I was a kid. As an adult, I finally bought a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" – advice from a friend and fellow artist. It promised to teach me the ropes, from the basics of understanding what a pencil is to the intricate processes our brains use to decipher lines. One technique caught my eye: framing a picture within a square. It's supposed to break down a complex scene into something manageable, transforming a messy bowl of fruit on a cluttered kitchen table into a simple, contained image. But at that moment, gazing at the toilet, I couldn't fathom the concept. I was overwhelmed, awestruck, and could only stand there, frozen in wonder.\n\nArtistic influences swirled through my mind – Picasso's blue period, Monet's love of greenery, the Renaissance masters' kaleidoscope of colors. If I dared to imagine myself as an artist, this was my chance to start something new, something worthy of the title. I had titled it \"Work in Brown\" in my mind. I reached for my trusty pencil, my hand flexing as I prepared to bring my vision to life. My muscles tensed, relaxed, and tensed again, as if ready to dance.\n\nBut instead, my hand smacked the toilet handle once, twice, with a growing sense of frustration. The offending package refused to budge, stuck like a stubborn slug on the bottom of the toilet. I stood, a mop in hand, my tie feeling constricting around my neck. A few more flushes, a few more moments to collect myself, and I reached for the toilet paper roll, wrapping my hand in a makeshift mitten. I stooped, dipping into the toilet bowl like a mother preparing the Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "The alarming statistics about teenagers behind the wheel are a sobering reminder of the perils of driving at a tender age. Several factors contribute to this grim reality, and the National Institutes of Health shed light on the brain's unreadiness for the dangers of driving as one crucial element. The lack of experience is another significant factor, leading to a higher frequency of fatal accidents, rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road. \n\nTeenagers, in particular, are more accident-prone when accompanied by their peers, which, as we all know, happens frequently. A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center revealed a telling correlation between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\nIn an effort to curb this trend, some states, including California, have implemented provisional driver's licenses that restrict the hours and passengers for teen drivers. However, I believe these measures are merely a temporary fix. The core issue lies in the fact that, statistically speaking, the youngest drivers are not equipped to handle the risks and responsibilities associated with driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman's research suggests that 18 is still too early for a full driver's license, as those under 19-20 tend to be thrill-seekers. Delaying driving licenses until this impulse subsides could save countless lives. Continuing to issue licenses to young teens will only lead to more tragic accidents and a staggering death toll in the coming years, particularly when millions of new teen drivers hit the road by 2010, the year the Baby Boomers' children become eligible.\n\nImplementing legislation to address this issue would be a relatively straightforward process. Schools could continue to offer driver's education classes to lay the groundwork for future drivers, but no one under 18 should be allowed to operate a vehicle. A provisional permit could still be issued before granting a full license, and a set number of practical training hours could be required. This number could be based on the existing standards of most states, such as California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult. Uniform national legislation would be a reasonable and effective way to protect teenagers across the country. This idea is not a new one, but it's a sound solution to a pressing problem.",
            "I decided to dive into the Library of Congress's treasure trove of early Edison films, specifically the trick films from 1895 to 1901. There are 15 of them in total, and I found myself captivated by their creative use of editing to conjure illusions. My exploration of these films focused on analyzing the poetic elements that make them tick and identifying the progressive characteristics that set some of the later films apart. At the turn of the century, trick films were largely static, confined to a single, frontal proscenium, and adhered to a strict one-shot-per-film rule, with a focus on long and medium shots. However, a few early 20th-century films dared to break free from these conventions by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nOne thing that stood out to me was the common thread of filming within an interior set, framed within a frontal proscenium. The camera remained stationary, refusing to follow figures or objects as they moved. This composition drew its roots from the theatre and, for trick films, the world of vaudeville and magic shows. A limitation of this setup was that figures in trick films were generally confined to side-to-side movement, unable to approach or recede from the camera. Take, for instance, the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where the actors enter from the right and move back and forth along the horizontal axis, disappearing from view without the camera following them.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style also led to a reliance on long shots, with medium shots appearing less frequently. Close-ups were nonexistent in these early trick films, a nod to the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would witness the entire performance from a fixed vantage point. As in many early films, actors rarely moved towards the camera, making close-ups a rarity. Most trick films from the Edison catalog stuck to the rule of one conceptual shot per film, keeping their length brief – typically under a minute, depending on the frames per second used. This constraint limited the dramatic and narrative potential of these films, which often focused on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearances, and switching acts with minimal storytelling. However, a closer examination of these films revealed that what appears to be one physical shot can, in fact, be several joined together to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance, as seen in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), where a more detailed inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the entire film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "Meet John Taylor of Caroline, a true pioneer in the realm of Republicanism. As a passionate advocate for individual liberties and limited government, his unwavering dedication to these causes was forged in the fires of his agricultural pursuits and brief foray into politics. While his work as a farmer formed the foundation of his views on governance, it was his conviction in the superiority of agrarian life that colored his opinions on sovereignty, constitutionalism, and the judiciary.\n\nTaylor believed that the United States possessed a unique opportunity to craft an ideal system of government, untainted by the influence of native traditions. This blank slate allowed him to envision a system of self-governance that would safeguard the inherent rights of individuals, which he believed were interdependent and indivisible. If one right was compromised, the value of all others would suffer. Consequently, these rights should be beyond the reach of government meddling. In his view, the so-called \"state of nature\" was a chaotic realm where the strong preyed on the weak, but he believed that civilization should not perpetuate this paradigm.\n\nTo create an ideal society, Taylor posited that a government must be established that acknowledges the duality of human nature – its propensity for both good and evil. He was resolute in his adherence to a dualistic morality, arguing that government, being an extension of humanity, would reflect both its virtues and vices. Taylor defined good principles as those that protected private property, promoted agriculture, and discouraged excessive capitalism. He contended that a government grounded in these principles would function impartially, despite the inevitable presence of self-interest and avarice in its administration. However, he believed that self-interest was only malevolent when it led to the proliferation of sub-societies that exploited others at the expense of the greater good. A benevolent government was necessary to contain humanity's darker tendencies, and it must be vigilantly monitored to prevent the introduction of pernicious principles.\n\nLike many stalwart Republicans of his time, Taylor championed a strict construction of the Constitution, advocating for a minimalist federal government with only the powers explicitly granted to it. He recognized that an expansive federal government was prone to despotism due to its associated costs. However, Taylor cautioned against a literal interpretation of the Constitution, warning that it could lead to corruption without consideration for the intent of its authors. Moreover, he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it more explicitly described the country as a federation of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Looking back at the data in Figure 17, we noticed a significant drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. This was a bit of a letdown, and it's tough to pinpoint the reason behind it. One possibility is that the onset of winter on our New England campus led people to abandon their bikes and foot-powered commutes, which could account for part of the decline. The end of the fall semester in December might also have played a role, as students and faculty were preoccupied with finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and the like, making it easy to overlook the commuter log. The start of the holiday season in December, followed by a month-long break for students and faculty, likely contributed to the low number of submissions. Things picked up again when classes resumed in late January, but the low numbers persisted through February. It's possible that the initial enthusiasm for the project wore off, leading to a natural decline in engagement. To counter this trend, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a special blitz campaign to revitalize the initiative, which succeeded in boosting log submissions for that month. However, this still left us grappling with the challenge of maintaining momentum despite the inevitable decrease in engagement due to holiday and semester breaks. Another hurdle for our project, and for any alternative commuting initiative, is the deep-seated cultural attachment to driving one's own vehicle. To overcome this, it's essential to offer incentives that appeal to people's love of freedom, independence, and flexibility on the road. We rewarded participants with gift cards to local eateries, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local bookstore, and even larger chain stores. It would have been interesting to see how bigger prizes might have impacted participation – perhaps a shiny new bike, a hybrid car, or an electric vehicle. This could have helped mitigate the dip in engagement we experienced. The prizes remained the same throughout the project, but if we had announced additional incentives over time, like a bike in December and a car in January, engagement might have increased instead of decreased.",
            "Imagine a financial product that's a hybrid of an index fund and a stock, offering the benefits of diversification and flexibility. That's what an exchange-traded fund, or ETF, is all about. Unlike a traditional mutual fund, an ETF allows you to buy and sell it on an exchange, much like a stock, but with the added advantage of tracking an index or a basket of assets. The allure of ETFs lies in their ability to provide diversification, the benefits of single stock ownership, and the flexibility to sell short, buy on margin, or purchase a single share in any transaction. But don't let that fool you - the expense ratios of ETFs are often lower than those of the average mutual fund. However, there's a catch: you'll need to pay a commission on every trade, just like you would with a stock order.\n\nThe real beauty of ETFs lies in their vast array of options, with various funds catering to different investment needs. But, it's crucial to keep in mind that even with these benefits, it's essential to scrutinize the actual performance of the ETF and its components. In this case, we're taking a closer look at the ETF IHF and its top 10 holdings, which account for a significant 63.58% of its assets. By examining these top holdings, we'll determine whether owning a single ETF can provide similar benefits to diversifying your portfolio with the same stocks.\n\nTo keep things concise, we'll focus on the top 10 holdings, representing the bulk of the ETF's assets. We'll use this subset to estimate how well the ETF's 10 stocks represent the entire fund. By calculating the Beta and return of a portfolio comprising only these 10 stocks, in the same proportions as the ETF's holdings, we can gauge their performance. The results are telling: a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings shows a 6.11% higher return, a whopping 16% increase, compared to the ETF. Moreover, the Beta of this portfolio is a full 0.12 lower than the ETF's, suggesting a potentially more stable investment.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that these findings might not be statistically significant. To confirm, we'll examine the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100%, and compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "I have always been fascinated by Edgar Allan Poe's magnum opus, \"Dream-Land.\" This enchanting poem is, in Poe's own words, one of his best works. One of the most intriguing aspects of \"Dream-Land\" is Poe's repeated use of the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56. According to the esteemed scholar Mabbott, this enigmatic reference can be traced back to the great Roman poet Virgil. Virgil, in his turn, borrowed the term from an ancient Greek concept, describing Thulé as an island situated at the edge of the known world, situated north of Britain.\n\nHowever, there's more to the story than meets the eye. Poe's fondness for German literature is well-documented, and it's likely that he drew inspiration from the works of the celebrated German author Goethe. Karl J. Arndt, in his seminal work \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" highlights the striking similarities between their two poems, concluding that Poe was, in fact, influenced by Goethe's writing.\n\nThe connection between Poe and Goethe is further cemented by Goethe's iconic poetic drama, \"Faust,\" which was published in two parts, with the first installment appearing in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe's passing. Within the second part of \"Faust,\" there's a poignant poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This haunting tale revolves around a king whose wife gives him a goblet before her passing, only to see him succumb to excessive drinking and despair. The king's eventual decision to give his possessions to his children and throw the goblet into the ocean, symbolizing his desire to join his beloved wife in death, bears an eerie resemblance to the demeanor of the speaker in \"Dream-Land.\" It's almost as if Poe's work is a dark mirror reflection of Goethe's, echoing his own struggles with loss and addiction.\n\nPoe's use of the term \"Thulé\" is more than just a coincidence, as he references it twice in his collected writings, including \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and \"Dream-Land.\" In fact, the two poems can be seen as companion pieces, with \"The King of Thulé\" serving as a haunting precursor to the desolate landscape of \"Dream-Land.\" The speaker's description of Thulé as a dark, lonely, and colorless world, haunted by the ghosts of departed friends, bears an uncanny resemblance to the king's own emotional state after the loss of his wife. This shared atmosphere of despair and longing suggests a deep connection between the two poems.\n\nIt's worth noting that Poe's admiration for Goethe was not limited to his own work. He also spoke highly of the English poet Tennyson, which would have introduced him to Goethe's writing. Moreover, the numerous reproductions of Goethe's work that followed its original publication would have ensured that Poe was well-versed in his literary legacy.",
            "You might wonder if a customer who slipped on a mess of applesauce at a grocery store and got hurt would be able to get punitive damages from the store manager, who ignored the spill for half an hour because he was too busy eating dinner. The manager had been informed twice about the spill, and even after that, he didn't do anything about it. But will a judge throw out the customer's claim right off the bat? \n\nI'd bet not. To get punitive damages, the customer will have to prove that the store manager acted with a reckless disregard for the harm that would come from leaving the spill there. They'll also have to show that the store manager's actions were despicable - basically, really bad and intentional. The customer has a good shot at this, considering that several other customers had slipped and fallen in the months before and the manager still did nothing to fix the problem. \n\nHere's the background: on October 13th at 5 pm, an employee told the manager, Paul Martin, about the applesauce spill, and he just blew him off, saying he was on his dinner break. Fifteen minutes later, another employee reminded him about the spill, and he gave the same response. Just half an hour later, the customer, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill and hurt her back. It turns out that this wasn't an isolated incident - five other customers had slipped and fallen at the store that same year. Now Palmer is suing the store for both compensation and punitive damages.\n\nIn California, a customer can sue for punitive damages if the store acted with malice - basically, if they intended to hurt the customer or showed a \"despicable\" disregard for the customer's safety. The law defines malice as acting with intent to harm or acting with a reckless disregard for others' safety, even if there's no intent to harm. It's like the court said in a previous case, when the defendant was aware of the potential danger of their actions and still chose to ignore it.",
            "It's been nearly four years since I took a course in Islam at CBC, a journey that sowed the seeds of a long-standing question: is Islam a hostile religion? As I reflect on the past two decades, I'm struck by the pendulum swing in public perception, oscillating wildly between hostility and excessive tolerance. The aftermath of 9/11 marked a turning point, as mass media shifted from a predominantly negative view of Islam to a more accepting stance. I find it astonishing that in 2001, it would have been unimaginable to have a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, whose family ties to Islam are undeniable.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad has long fascinated me, particularly the contradictions between history and the narrative's portrayal of his personality. In my understanding, Muhammad was supposed to be a forceful figure who coerced people into converting to Islam, conquering tribes and imposing his faith upon them. However, the biography presents a different picture – that of a humbled and misunderstood prophet, who humbled himself before others, and his message drew people to him one by one as they discovered the 'truth'. This dichotomy leaves me intrigued and, to a certain extent, perplexed.\n\nA striking parallel exists between the ministries of Jesus and the reported miracles of Muhammad. One notable example is the multiplication of mutton and milk, which was more than enough for forty men. This style of writing makes me believe that the authors aimed to depict Muhammad as a humble prophet, not one driven to prove himself, but one who lived in truth and miracle. This narrative strategy concerns me, as it diminishes the life and message of Jesus Christ, seemingly appropriating and diluting his significance. It's as if they're borrowing from and attempting to claim Jesus' legacy for Muhammad.\n\nFurthermore, the biography attributes great importance to providing evidence of 'witness' and how people 'independently' converted to Islam. However, many stories rely on hearsay, often tracing back to a third-party source. I found this approach off-putting, as it diminishes the stories' authenticity and makes them seem all the more suspicious.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this work is the attempt to elevate Muhammad to a godly figure, emphasizing his humility, gentle nature, and wisdom. Yet, historical accounts contradict this portrayal, and I can't help but wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true circumstances surrounding Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "It's fascinating to note that the core teachings of Jesus have largely been left in the dust as Christianity evolved over the centuries.  If we look at the broader timeline, it's clear that Christianity has gradually strayed further and further from its original roots.  Today, we're witnessing a growing awareness of this trend and an unprecedented desire for progress.  While traditionalists will undoubtedly resist any attempts to move beyond established dogma, their influence may ultimately be outweighed by those craving a deeper understanding of the faith's true origins.  As the years go by, historical awareness will become increasingly widespread among Christians, sparking a yearning to distinguish the doctrines that have been added to the faith from the intentions of its namesake.  This shift may take decades or even centuries, but the end result is inevitable:  Christianity will undergo a great reversal, progressing backward toward its original form.  A movement will gain momentum, shedding layer upon layer of doctrine as if time itself were rewinding, until all that remains is a glimpse of what Jesus brought to humanity on behalf of God, untainted by the interpretations of subsequent thinkers.  As this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, it will draw in the masses, influencing them to worship in a more authentic, Jesus-centric way.  The institutional church will remain strong, guiding the faithful on this journey back to the faith's roots.  However, this reverse trajectory will bring about a surprising consequence: instead of the rich diversity that has characterized Christendom, we can expect to see a growing uniformity of belief and practice across regions, denominations, and divisions.  History is replete with examples of this kind of reversal, such as how the Roman Empire, once a persecutor of Christians, eventually became a bastion of the faith.  Similarly, our country has transitioned from a time of African-American slavery to a era of African-American leadership.  The impending reversion in Christianity will be a remarkable process, undoing centuries of accumulated tradition in search of the original source, and in the process, erasing the very diversity that has come to define the faith.  Crucially, this transformation will be facilitated by a more nuanced approach to Jesus' words, viewing them as metaphors rather than literal statements.  So, what exactly happened since Jesus' time?\n       Looking further back into history, we find that the roots of Christianity lay firmly in Judaism.  By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., the core tenets of the faith were already in place: monotheism, a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures.  However, the Jewish population was far from unified, with various factions like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and common people vying for influence.",
            "The Jungle is an expose that reveals the darker side of human nature - a side where self-interest and greed reign supreme. Beneath the surface, we find individuals consumed by a never-ending pursuit of personal gain, with little regard for anyone or anything else. This is starkly evident in the portrayal of the factory owners and managers, who prioritize profit over people and the environment. As Upton Sinclair vividly illustrates, their relentless drive for growth and expansion leaves a trail of destruction in its wake, as seen in the image of \"the line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" Sinclair's depiction of the pollution and neglect is a scathing indictment of the owners' callous disregard for those affected by their actions.\n\nThe factory owners and managers also demonstrate a lack of concern for their employees, whom they treat as mere commodities to be exploited for their labor. They stop at nothing to maximize profits, regardless of the cost to the workers' well-being, as evident in the statement \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" The employees are subjected to grueling working hours, with little notice or support when they are laid off, often leaving them to fend for themselves in a system with few regulations to protect their rights. The book portrays a system where workers are expected to sacrifice their health and dignity for the sake of their jobs, with no safety net or support to fall back on.\n\nThe era in which The Jungle is set saw a lack of laws and regulations to safeguard workers' rights, allowing the factory owners and managers to operate with impunity. The unions that formed to represent the workers often ended up perpetuating the exploitation, profiting from the very people they were supposed to protect. As a result, the workers were trapped in a cycle of poverty and dependence, with little hope of escape. Sinclair's stark conclusion is that, in this system, immorality and desperation are inevitable, much like under the institution of slavery.",
            "The art of crafting a narrative that evokes a certain mood or attitude in readers is a delicate dance that many authors attempt to master. Not all of these techniques are equally effective, and F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel The Great Gatsby is a prime example of this. To create a lasting impression, Fitzgerald frequently employs a range of literary devices, including juxtaposing words that don't typically go together. He also assigns deeper meanings to symbols, which he then cleverly incorporates into his writing. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald expertly uses colors, like white/gray and red/pink, to build an aura around important subjects.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of Fitzgerald's use of color is the way he imbues white/gray with a sense of uniformity. To him, white connotes elegance and refinement, while gray represents something more aged and worn. He sets the stage for this association early on in the novel by consistently using these colors. For instance, Daisy and Jordan are often depicted wearing white, as are most other characters. Nick sports white flannels at Gatsby's party, Tom wears a white shirt when meeting Myrtle, and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white.\" Conversely, when Nick describes Gatsby's party, the atmosphere is described as \"gaudy with primary colors,\" implying that white is typically reserved for more subdued settings. Fitzgerald reinforces this association by applying these colors to everyday objects and people, such as the \"white chasms of lower New York\" Nick navigates every day, or the \"gray names\" on Nick's schedule.\n\nFitzgerald also uses white and gray to describe common, unremarkable people and places. For example, he describes Jordan and Daisy's shared \"white girlhood,\" the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes, and the \"gray old man\" selling dogs. By applying these colors to the mundane, Fitzgerald creates a sense of sameness, highlighting the monotony of everyday life.\n\nAfter establishing the meaning of white/gray, Fitzgerald uses them to convey a sense of unimportance or uniformity, particularly in relation to Daisy. After a pause in their use, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in a \"little white roadster,\" subtly suggesting that she has become a uniform, almost interchangeable part of Gatsby's world. This technique is repeated when Daisy is described as wearing a \"gray haze of fur collar\" and a \"white\" dress before her encounter with Tom and Gatsby. Through this use of color, Fitzgerald skillfully conveys Daisy's status as a desirable object, rather than a fully fleshed-out character.",
            "The land of San Diego County is a haven for agricultural bounty, thanks to its pleasant climate and an abundance of sunshine. Crops like tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, and peppers thrive in the area. With a strong demand for organic, community-supported agriculture, local farms have long waiting lists. Even organic eggs and milk are in high demand. Many of these farms open their gates to visitors, offering behind-the-scenes tours and opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other leisure activities. This type of operation not only allows landowners to tap into government incentives but also enables them to create a haven for wildlife, promoting biodiversity and offering a chance for educational programs and revenue streams.\n\nWhile organic farming can be a lucrative venture, it also has its own set of challenges. For one, it requires more labor and management to keep pests and weeds at bay without relying on chemicals, and losses can be greater than those experienced by conventional methods. Additionally, small organic farms often can't match the efficiency of larger operations, and practices like planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, and invasive species removal can be labor-intensive and costly. Considering these factors, a landowner in this scenario might seek financial assistance or expert guidance to optimize both profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe land in question is a 160-acre property in unincorporated San Diego County, adjacent to the town of Potrero. It's a diverse landscape of chaparral, nonnative grassland, and oak woodland, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. This area falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which currently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals, many of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the California gnatcatcher, while others are declining and may soon be listed.\n\nFor centuries, Native Americans inhabited this land before it was settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This particular piece of land was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing and wood production for many years.\n\nTo explore the possibilities for a small farmer on this land, I selected a real estate listing and researched government programs that could help mitigate costs and preserve wildlife-friendly practices. As a model of what someone farming this land might aim to achieve, I chose an organic farm in the same region.",
            "The impact of culture on negotiations cannot be overstated. Culture is a multifaceted entity that is often misunderstood or oversimplified. We frequently hear generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating,\" but these broad statements do little to illuminate the complexities of cultural attitudes. A more nuanced understanding of a culture can be gained by recognizing what it signifies and what it is not. In other words, culture is just as much about its absence as its presence.\n\nWhen approaching a foreign culture, we inevitably make comparisons to our own, which can lead to a superficial understanding. To truly grasp a culture, one must delve deeper, studying its history, understanding its prejudices, and acknowledging its idiosyncrasies. Rather than judging or trying to change a culture, it's essential to accept it for what it is and work within its boundaries, especially in the high-stakes world of negotiation.\n\nThe boundaries of culture extend far beyond national or international borders. Corporate cultures can be just as distinct as national cultures, with their own values, norms, and expectations. A company's dress code, communication style, and hiring practices can all reveal its underlying culture. For instance, some companies prioritize long hours in the office, while others encourage a more relaxed schedule. Even within a single company, regional and urban-suburban differences can create diverse subcultures.\n\nTo succeed in negotiation, it's crucial to understand the underlying values of a culture. If, for example, saving face or communal harmony is deeply ingrained in a culture, a negotiator will likely avoid public shaming or confrontation. Conversely, a culture that values a hard-driving bargain may not prioritize settling for a quick agreement. By considering these generalities before the negotiation table, a savvy negotiator can adapt their approach and build a stronger relationship with their opponent.\n\nMoreover, taking the time to learn about an opponent's personal values and motivations can be a game-changer in effective negotiation. By doing so, a negotiator can tailor their approach to the unique cultural context and create a more harmonious and productive discussion.",
            "I often wonder, 'What's the point of even arguing?' As the saying goes, \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" A phrase famously coined in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and later echoed in the writings of St. Anselm. This particular concept seems to be shared by the equally influential Thomas Aquinas, and as we delve into their works, it's clear that their arguments are intertwined. For the sake of simplicity, let's assume both authors believe in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. This allows us to focus on their arguments without getting bogged down in nuances. \n\nAs we explore their views, I'd like to suggest that while both St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas present compelling points, their approaches leave room for improvement. Let's start with Anselm's take. He posits that understanding God begins within ourselves. According to him, we can't fathom a world without God, so we must accept that God exists because it's inherent to our understanding. Anselm's idea is that our minds are the ultimate authority for determining the truth about God, and that external evidence is unnecessary. This concept is at the heart of Christian faith – a leap of trust without concrete proof.\n\nIn stark contrast, Thomas Aquinas takes a more empirical approach. He believes that God's existence can be proven through reason and evidence, freeing Christians from the need for faith. This would be a game-changer for evangelism, allowing converts to be wooed by logic rather than blind faith. Aquinas presents five distinct logical arguments for the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each of these demonstrates that the necessity of God is a logical inevitability, akin to understanding a missing puzzle piece by piecing together the rest of the puzzle.",
            "It all began sometime in the 5th or 6th century BCE with a prince destined to become the revered Buddha. Over the course of his life, he turned his back on worldly pursuits and discovered enlightenment. His teachings eventually gave rise to Buddhism – a 2,500-year-old tradition that has undergone significant transformations since its inception. This evolution can be observed in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is a poignant example. Despite the fact that Buddha never taught about such festivities, monks and lay followers alike participate in this ritual, making it a crucial aspect of their spiritual lives. This divergence from the original teachings is just one of the many ways in which Theravada Buddhism has adapted its theological and philosophical foundations over time. These changes have been influenced by both internal and external forces – some benevolent, others malevolent.\n\nThroughout this discussion, we will frequently use various terms to describe these forces. 'Internal' refers to influences stemming from within the Buddhist community, regardless of one's monastic status. External influences come from outside the community. A hostile force is any element that seeks to harm or damage the Buddhist community, often stemming from a negative perception of Buddhism. In contrast, a benign force has no intention to harm or assist the community, although it may inadvertently have one of these effects.\n\nLet's start by examining the fundamental principles of Theravada Buddhism – the core doctrines that have guided the community for centuries. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is comprised of the Tripitaka – the three baskets of sacred texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. These notions include the concepts of Anatta – the absence of a permanent self, Dukkha – the inherent suffering in life, and Anicca – the impermanence of everything. By acknowledging these fundamental truths, one can break free from Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, and ultimately eliminate lobha – desire, dosa – hatred, and moha – delusion. The Vinaya Pitaka outlines the rules for lay followers, such as the five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not engage in misconduct, and I shall not consume intoxicating substances). Monks, on the other hand, adhere to a more extensive set of disciplinary rules. The four noble truths form the foundation of Buddhist doctrine: the first, that life is suffering; the second, that attachment is the root cause of suffering; and the third, that suffering can be overcome.",
            "It's hard to believe how the United States and Mexico were once locked in a 57-year rivalry that lasted from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The rivalry reached its peak with the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the US came out on top, claiming Texas and the American Southwest as its own territory. This wasn't an isolated incident – there were many other clashes between the two nations before the First World War finally brought an end to the hostilities. \n\nThis long-standing rivalry was fueled by deep-seated differences between Americans and Mexicans on issues like faith, culture, and tradition (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31). Sound familiar? This isn't a unique scenario – neighboring nations often clash over competing interests, leading to enduring rivalries. The US and Mexico are just one example of a pair of nations that, despite sharing a border, struggled to see eye-to-eye. David M. Pletcher (1977) noted that Mexico and Cuba are the only Latin American nations that have presented long-term diplomatic challenges for the US (p. 41). It's no coincidence that they're both geographically close to the US and have a history of rivalry.\n\nReligious differences were a major point of contention between the two nations, a problem that has plagued many countries throughout history. As Sally Frahm (2001) pointed out, \"if Americans opposed fascism and communism in the 20th century, they were once opposed to Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries\" (p. 86). This ideological struggle was as much about competing interests as it was about differing values. In this case, the ideological differences were rooted in the religious preferences of the two nations, a legacy of the distrust between the English and Spanish empires. This inherited animosity made it difficult for the US and Mexico to establish a positive relationship.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) documented 17 disputes between Mexico and the US during the 57-year rivalry period. Most of these disputes centered on territorial issues, including border raids from Mexican territory and other frontier problems. Border violence, particularly from American border towns, was a persistent issue until the US and Mexico finally exerted military force to control their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).\n\nAs Schmitt (1974) noted, the rivalry began to subside as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the US (p. 109) and American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (p. 110) in the late 19th century. This marked the end of the long-standing rivalry between the two nations.",
            "It was 15 years ago that an unexpected illness suddenly rendered me unable to work. At the time, I was a nurse, a profession I had chosen for the security and stability it promised, a sense of safety I desperately craved as a child. The mantra that echoed through my adolescence and beyond was \"you'll always find work; people will always get sick.\" So, I put aside my dream of becoming a scientist or journalist to pursue a more practical path.\n\nNow, at 46, I'm single, broke, and living on the fragile support of Social Security Disability. Fifteen years have passed, and I've lost everything that truly belongs to me. Each day is a struggle, a relentless assault on my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. The only constant in my life is the unwavering support of my family and a few loyal friends, who've been my lifeline in times of crisis.\n\nDespite my strength, I've come to realize that when disaster strikes, it's a cruel illusion to think you can face it alone. Life's emergencies, whether big or small, are a guarantee. No amount of preparation can shield you from the overwhelming forces that life throws at you.\n\nI agree that our reliance on the government is a fragile foundation, but I firmly believe it's time for Americans to rediscover the value of trust, community, and mutual aid. Rather than building individual shelters, we should be learning to support one another, to ask for help when needed, and to offer a helping hand in times of need.\n\nThe concept of rugged individualism, touted by Conservatives as the backbone of American spirit, is a myth. Our forefathers didn't survive the harsh realities of frontier life alone; they thrived on compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains knew that working together was the only way to reach their destination.\n\nSo, by all means, prepare for the unexpected. I've stocked my disaster kit with essentials, from first aid supplies to water purification tablets and duct tape. I've got flashlights, batteries, candles, and canned goods, ready for any eventuality. But while you're at it, take a step further – get to know your neighbors.\n\nBy building connections and fostering a sense of community, we can create a safety net that's stronger than any government program or emergency kit. It's time to rediscover the values that truly made America great: compassion, mutual respect, and a willingness to help one another in times of need.",
            "I've always wondered, what drives organisms to evolve the way they do? Are there hidden rules, constraints that shape the path of evolutionary change? The field has been puzzling over this question for a long time, and even Darwin's contemporary, D'Arcy Thompson, noted in 1917 that scientists were still struggling to quantify the simplest forms of life. Fast-forward to today, and while we've made progress, we still have a long way to go. Recently, some scientists have applied mathematical modeling to the way mollusks grow their shells, looking at both how they develop over time (ontogeny) and how they've changed over millions of years (phylogeny). Our study is taking a similar approach, using math and experiments to figure out what drives the twists and turns of evolutionary change in a group of snails called Prunum.\n\nWe started by studying X-ray images of Prunum shells to identify key characteristics that could help us model how their shells might change over time. These characteristics were then plugged into a software program called CerioShell, which let us simulate different shell shapes and sizes. By comparing these hypothetical shells to real ones, we're hoping to get a better understanding of how Prunum shells have evolved over time.\n\nShells are like a spiral staircase, growing outward in a continuous loop. Each turn of the shell is called a whorl, and they're connected by a line called a suture. The largest whorl is the last one, called the body whorl, and the tip of the shell is the apex. As the shell grows, the animal extends out through an opening called the aperture. By looking at shells from different angles – apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural – we can get a better sense of their shape and size.\n\nTo count the number of whorls, you need to look at the shell from the top and find the first suture. Then, draw a line and start counting from there, estimating to a quarter of a whorl if necessary. By mapping out the path of the aperture through time and space, we can see how the shell has grown and changed over time. This journey can be represented mathematically and graphically, allowing us to experiment with different parameters and see how they affect the shell's development.\n\nBy combining math and experiments, we're one step closer to understanding the mysteries of evolutionary change in Prunum.",
            "For the past decade, Indonesia has witnessed a stagnation in neonatal and infant mortality rates.  While the country is making progress in achieving some of the Millennium Development Goals, such as water and sanitation targets, the rate of improvement in child and maternal health has fallen woefully short of the required target by 2015.  The multitude of factors behind this lag will be discussed below, suggesting a need to fortify the health system rather than focusing on programmatic interventions.\n\nIndonesia has seen an increase in the number of births attended by skilled healthcare workers, with 72% now meeting this benchmark.  However, this statistic also includes traditional attendants like midwives who cannot provide medical assistance in complicated cases, thus contributing to the high rate of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage.  Consequently, the improvements in this indicator are somewhat misleading, and there is still much work to be done.  Moreover, there has been a decline in the percentage of children under five treated by a healthcare professional for diarrheal cases.  The data on postnatal care is incomplete, but it is evident that this area is a concern, with low rates across the country.\n\nThe rate of cesarean sections remains alarmingly low at around 4%, and another red flag is raised by the fact that these rates are 7% in urban settings, but only 2% in rural areas.  This disparity highlights the issue of unequal access to healthcare services across the country, with urban areas receiving more attention.  The problem of vertical equity is also apparent, with a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, indicating that the poor are struggling to access healthcare services due to high out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen considering the next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most fundamental question is how to effectively address the shortage of services.  Specifically, should Indonesia opt for program-specific approaches or strengthen its overall health system without focusing solely on pre and post-pregnancy care for mothers and children?  While programmatic approaches to address the problems outlined may seem attractive, they have drawbacks.  For instance, heavily investing in a single area can divert resources away from other critical sectors, leading to a brain drain of human resources towards the more funded area.  Furthermore, running multiple parallel programs can result in duplication of services, uncoordinated efforts, and an increase in paperwork and administrative burdens.",
            "Victorian novels are often characterized by their meticulous attention to detail, frequently focusing on the aristocracy of the era.  However, two notable exceptions are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, which stray from this tradition by incorporating elements of mystery and the bizarre, characteristics not typically associated with Victorian fiction. These elements add depth to the characters within each novel, providing insight into their motivations and emotions.\n\nThe narrative of Oliver Twist is riddled with bewildering and confusing ideas as the protagonist navigates the dark world he inhabits. He finds himself caught between the turbulent lives of Sikes and Crackit, who are locked in a heated dispute. The words they exchange echo in his mind, making it difficult for him to distinguish reality from fantasy. In a state of disorientation, he's suddenly jolted back to reality by the sound of gunfire, and the world around him descends into chaos. A sense of unease and pain lingers, haunting him as he's whisked away by an unseen force. This passage from Dickens' work illustrates the unsettling nature of Oliver's world, where he's often overwhelmed by the harsh realities that surround him.\n\nOliver Twist and Wuthering Heights employ the use of dream sequences or dreamlike states to convey the mystery within their narratives. In Oliver Twist, these strange occurrences often reveal Oliver's inner turmoil, offering a glimpse into his deepest pains and fears. When the shooting incident is revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the moment vividly, as if stuck in a dream, while desperately searching for help. This passage underscores the lack of control Oliver has over the events unfolding around him, highlighting his dire situation and the trauma he's endured. As he's overwhelmed by the memory of the shooting, the question arises as to whose will is at play, suggesting that Oliver's misfortune may not be his own doing. This reinforces the idea that he's at the mercy of forces beyond his control, leaving him feeling defeated and powerless to act.\n\nSimilarly, Wuthering Heights is marked by long, oppressive nights that stretch on forever, yet seem to pass by in an instant. The day is always fleeting, and the silence is oppressive, making the hours feel like an eternity. This sense of timelessness is a fitting backdrop for the turmoil that unfolds within the novel.",
            "A couple of years ago, I was working with an after-school program where I tutored elementary-age students in various subjects. I did my best to help them in the areas where they were struggling, but my strengths lay in English and reading. One student, a young boy named Adrian, really caught my attention – he was in third or fourth grade, I think. He had a peculiar problem with reading, which only became apparent as I worked with him. Some letters were no-brainers for him, while others left him stumped, which was bizarre. Given his likely Latino background, I was taken aback by his perfect English skills, but it all started to make sense when I met his mother.\n\nThe moment she walked in, speaking only Spanish, it hit me like a ton of bricks: Adrian's literacy issues weren't about reading itself, but the English alphabet and its pronunciation. I realize now that my limited Spanish skills at the time made communication a bit of a challenge, but we managed to convey our message. That epiphany led me to wonder if that revelation ever helped him in the long run, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier issue in schools, particularly in California, and to show that it's not always as straightforward as we think. Even for kids who speak perfect English, reading can be a significant hurdle. I believe everyone acknowledges this problem, so what's the solution? In Adrian's case, it was as simple as targeted English reading tutoring, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for kids who barely speak English, it's a much more complex issue. There's no one-size-fits-all answer. We can't rely on any single method – dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutors, or ESL classes – to solve this problem. The key lies in combining multiple approaches.\n\nOne thing that stands out is the dual language system, which is an excellent idea not just for kids who speak Spanish as their first language but for all students. Research shows that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. A lot of misconceptions surround this idea, claiming it's a waste of resources and that most students won't benefit. But that's a false assumption. If we implemented these programs as the norm, rather than the exception, all children would benefit from them. So, how do we make it happen? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? That's unrealistic and unreasonable. Instead, I think we can have bilingual aids, tutors, or whatever we want to call them, to support students in the classroom.",
            "We've all been conditioned from a young age that there's something greater than ourselves, something that transcends our understanding. Some of us are raised in Sunday school, while others explore their spirituality through meditation or introspection. Many of us stick to the faith passed down to us by our parents, but some reject it altogether, opting instead for a more personalized worldview. We navigate a complex landscape of spirituality, searching for our own unique answers to the mysteries of the universe. Our quest for meaning often begins with a desire to escape the darkness and find solace in the light.\n\nOne rainy evening, I recall sitting on the porch with my father, watching the gutters overflow with rainwater, drowning the plants at the edge of the step. He stared out into the downpour, a look that was both distant and introspective. His health had taken a turn for the worse, and his once robust physique had given way to a more gaunt appearance. His hair had thinned, and his eyes seemed to be searching for something beyond the present moment. I felt a deep sense of unease and longing, but the words caught in my throat, unable to articulate the depth of my sorrow. I hugged him, sat back down beside him, and joined him in gazing out into the rain-soaked twilight, the sound of the raindrops a melancholy serenade.\n\nMy father passed away in December, just five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation had prolonged his life, but at what cost, I couldn't help but wonder. What kind of higher power would allow this suffering? In the dead of night, I found myself praying not to a deity, but to an empty void, as if pleading for an answer that never came. If there was a God, I thought, he had long since stopped listening to my pleas.\n\nI couldn't bring myself to witness my father's final moments. I chose to remember him by his life, not his passing. I knew him better than anyone else, and I knew he wouldn't have wanted me to be a spectator to his death. For three days, I curled up in my bed, waiting for the news that would change everything. But the silence was deafening – no one called to share the news with me.",
            "I've always found it fascinating how the term \"Gothic Novel\" seems to be an oxymoron - an \"old-new\" hybrid, as Ian Watt puts it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. For years, the Gothic mode has been both maligned and lauded, with some arguing it lacks depth and others praising its \"terrible sublime\" qualities (Burke). I suspect this duality stems from the genre's roots in a bygone era. The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, cleverly combined elements from both \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances to birth the proto-Gothic genre. By blending the old with the new, Walpole created a new form of literary expression. The Gothic genre drew inspiration from medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions, yet it was often seen as old-fashioned and unsophisticated in comparison to the \"modern\" literary and societal advancements of its time.\n\nOne of the defining characteristics of Gothic novels is the idea of chivalry, a medieval concept that emphasizes the virtues of a proper knight. This notion, as seen in The Castle of Otranto, is not only retained but also transformed. Chivalry, particularly in the context of the Gothic novel, represents an idealized and romanticized version of the past - a time when knights were brave, honorable, and competent. This nostalgic portrayal hints at the future evolution of Gothic into Romantic literature. Walpole, who wrote The Castle of Otranto during a tumultuous period, may have been attempting to critique the present by idealizing the past. His character Frederic, for instance, embodies many chivalric traits - he's a prince, a victim of tragedy, and a gallant and courteous figure. This exaggerated portrayal of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" sets the stage for the Gothic trope of excess.",
            "As I sit here, pondering the intricacies of the business world, I find myself reflecting on the concept of supply chain management - that intricate dance of moving goods from customer orders to raw materials, supply, production, and distribution, all the way to the customer's doorstep. It's a process that has been around since 1982, when consultant Keith Oliver coined the term. Oliver described the elaborate process of planning, implementing, and controlling the supply chain to satisfy customers' needs in a swift and efficient manner. The puzzle pieces of supply chain management revolve around six key elements: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information.\n\nA manager's best friend in this supply chain game is the production stage, the foundation upon which the entire process stands. It's the moment when the 'when, why, where, and how' of production is outlined. To get to this point, managers must tap into the market, that elusive indicator of customer demand. By studying the market, managers can determine what customers crave, and in turn, decide what products to produce, how many to produce, and where to produce them. It's a delicate balancing act, keeping in mind the customer's satisfaction and demand.\n\nOnce the production location is chosen, the focus shifts to scheduling workloads and equipment maintenance - a task that requires precision, as every detail counts. A minor misstep can cost a company dearly in the long run. I recall my days working at retail giants like Wal-Mart and Target, where every aspect of the business, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments, was meticulously planned out in a detailed booklet. Having a clear plan of action ensures that the company runs smoothly, without confusion or misdirection.\n\nSupply, the second key element in the supply chain management equation, involves strategic decisions about a company's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. It's a delicate dance of determining which divisions of production are best suited for each process, and when to outsource work to other companies.

            "A haunting message scrawled on a street corner, a stark reminder of the oppressed. Ellen Page, the talented star of Juno, stands alone, a cardboard sign held high above her head, the bold words \"Hitler is alive in Burma\" written in Sharpie. Burma, or Myanmar, a Southeast Asian nation ruled by a ruthless military junta that seized power in 1962 through a violent coup d'état. Just a decade ago, in 2007, a series of protests erupted, dubbed the \"Saffron Revolution,\" as thousands of Burmese monks took to the streets, donning their iconic saffron robes. The government, though initially tolerant, soon cracked down, unleashing a brutal crackdown on the peaceful gatherings. Journalists were arrested and foreign reporters, including Japanese photojournalist Kenji Nagai, were killed for simply bearing witness. The official death toll stands at 13, but Colonel Hla Win, a defector from the army, revealed a chilling truth: \"The bodies can be counted in several thousand.\"\n\nThis is just a grim snapshot of a timeless tale. The desire to silence dissent and maintain control has been a hallmark of governments throughout history. From ancient Rome, where emperors claimed divine right to rule, to modern-day leaders who seek to crush opposition, this pattern persists. Japanese emperors were considered gods, sent to guide their people towards prosperity, while our own president, George W. Bush, reportedly held clandestine meetings with Ted Haggard, leader of a fundamentalist group. The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China, the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, and, of course, the atrocities of the Third Reich all serve as stark reminders of the dangers of unchecked power.",
            "The inimitable legacy of Duke Ellington in the realm of jazz can be largely attributed to his remarkable longevity, which, in turn, allowed him to continually shape and evolve his orchestra. Though his piano playing is often understated in many of his compositions, Ellington's prowess as a composer is undeniable, particularly in his ability to craft rich, complex pieces that showcased the diverse talents of his band members. By carefully crafting the framework for improvisation, as well as writing intricately orchestrated passages that highlighted the unique styles of individual musicians, Ellington created a distinctive sound that was both original and coherent. His deep understanding of each player's voice and how they blended together in the ensemble enabled him to compose some of the most groundbreaking and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary provides insight into Ellington's innovative approach to sound, citing his use of voice as a \"jazz instrument\" in Creole Love Call, an early example of his ability to incorporate vocal texture without the constraints of lyrics. This slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece exemplifies Ellington's skill in complementing the style of his soloists, a characteristic that defines his career. The piece unfolds over six choruses, each with its own distinct character:\n\nChorus 1: A call-and-response exchange between voice and reeds, where the voice begins with a smooth, melodic tone, gradually shifting to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that expands on the basic melody, emphasizing several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus, with a call-and-response exchange between the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus, as the reeds initiate the call-and-response, backed by syncopated stop-time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the first chorus's structure, with call-and-response between voice and reeds. In this final chorus, the voice adopts the growl technique, soloing like an instrument.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is but one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington masterfully combines his expertise in orchestration with his ear for tone color. The call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing is a prime example of Ellington's ability to create a rich, complementary sound by blending vocal and instrumental elements. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) further explores these ideas, as Ellington skillfully utilizes Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone to introduce the melody.",
            "It was a nagging void that had plagued her since adolescence - a sense of yearning that she couldn't quite quench. It started when she was 14, right in the midst of navigating the ups and downs of being a teenager. Three years later, at 17, the feeling still lingered, but now she was convinced it was a desire for connection with someone, not just a thing. Yet, despite the attention from a few boys, none of them had truly piqued her interest. She often found herself lost in self-reflection, searching for answers to this enigma. Theories had surfaced over the years, but nothing had ever felt quite right. Life went on, with her constantly questioning her desires, searching for a resolution.\n\nHer home life was typically a serene sanctuary. Her parents were calm and peaceful individuals who rarely argued with each other. Oddly enough, they were even less likely to argue with their daughter, who was always trying to assert her independence and vibrant personality. This dynamic created an interesting contrast between her parents' tranquility and her lively, outgoing nature, making her even more endearing to those around her.\n\nBut this particular day was different. As she wandered from room to room, seeking inspiration, she was jolted by a blood-curdling scream from the kitchen. Her mother's melodious voice pierced the air, followed by her frantic words. She rushed into the kitchen, panic setting in as she frantically asked, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" Her mother lay on the ground, writhing in pain, repeatedly muttering \"Ow\" in short gasps. Her daughter rushed to her side, placing a hand on her to offer support. \"Ouch... sweetie, I... need you to take me to... the hospital.\" The words tumbled out in a rush, and her daughter could sense the gravity of her mother's pain. \"Okay, Mom, just show me where to pick you up.\" Her mother pointed, and in that moment, her daughter was grateful for her fitness classes, which had prepared her to take on this unexpected role. She gently lifted her mother and drove her to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital's sterile atmosphere, heavy with the scent of disinfectant and illness, was a daunting place. But her daughter's focus was solely on helping her mother. She swiftly carried her in and called for the doctors, who quickly arrived to assess the situation. A few worried faces gathered around as they rushed her mother onto a rolling bed. The medical team whisked her away, leaving her daughter to sit anxiously, her mind racing with concern.\n\nIt turned out her mother had taken a tumble off a stool while trying to retrieve a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the benefits of adhering to the Mediterranean Diet (Med diet), as measured by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" in reducing the risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke mortality. The aMed diet is a variation of the Med diet that emphasizes higher consumption of plant foods, including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, while limiting saturated fats and animal products, with moderate alcohol intake allowed.\n\nPrevious studies have shown a connection between adherence to the Med diet and a lower risk of total and cardiovascular mortality, and an intervention trial found the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and improving cholesterol ratios in obese individuals. However, these studies did not specifically examine the relationship between the Med diet and stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study, which followed 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, free of heart disease or diabetes, utilized data from the Nurses' Health Study, a comprehensive cohort study of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Over six intervals between 1984 and 2004, researchers calculated an aMed diet score based on self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs), which assessed nutrient intake over a one-year period. Remarkably, over 95% of participants continued their participation throughout the 20-year study.\n\nTo validate the accuracy of FFQs, each report of heart disease, fatal heart disease, and stroke was cross-checked against medical records, hospital records, autopsy reports, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, \"probable\" cases were included, accounting for approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts.\n\nTo mitigate the impact of individual fluctuations and better represent long-term dietary habits, cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging scores from two preceding years). The researchers also controlled for potential confounding factors, such as age, smoking status, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing Cox proportional-hazard modeling, the study found that a higher aMed diet score was associated with a reduced risk of heart disease and stroke in women. Over the course of 20 years, a total of 2,391 incident CHD cases, 1,763 incident strokes, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were documented. Women in the top aMed quintile exhibited a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "We're still reeling from the economic earthquake that shook the United States to its core in 2007. Unemployment skyrocketed, the housing market imploded, and some of America's top corporations crumbled to the ground. And here we are, still grappling with the wreckage – so it's only natural to wonder: how did this catastrophe unfold, and can we prevent it from happening again? In a nutshell, the financial crisis was triggered by shortsighted and reckless government policies that pushed banks and financial institutions to hand out subprime loans to those who couldn't afford them, against the backdrop of a fragile and underprepared financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) got saddled with underwriting and repackaging these dodgy mortgages into CDOs and CDSs, which had disastrous consequences when borrowers defaulted on their payments.\n\nThe roots of the financial crisis stretch back to 1999, when President Clinton was on a mission to secure a second term. He sought to boost his popularity by easing lending regulations, setting the stage for the subprime crisis that would unfold seven years later. As Steven Holmes of the New York Times astutely observed in 1999, Fannie Mae – the country's largest underwriter of home mortgages – was feeling the heat from the Clinton administration to make more loans to low- and moderate-income borrowers, while also being pressed by shareholders to maintain its impressive profit growth. Holmes prophetically warned of the potential consequences: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may struggle in an economic downturn, prompting a government bailout similar to the one for the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As we now know, poorly advised lending would lead to an economic meltdown.\n\nA perfect storm of factors contributed to the economic freefall, including the proliferation of innovative but complicated mortgage products like adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These complex financial instruments entwined the housing market with other sectors of the economy, leaving U.S. households and financial markets perilously exposed to even slight changes in housing prices. And then, as if on cue, the housing bubble burst, leaving financial institutions that had invested in mortgage-backed securities reeling. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007 – a staggering 30% of the country's GDP. In the aftermath, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at fire-sale prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to convert to commercial banks subject to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie, meanwhile, were left with a whopping $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were taken under government control in September 2008.",
            "The thrill of exposition - that moment when writers stretch their wings and soar, leaving readers in awe of their prose.  Or, more often, the part where readers' eyelids droop and they hastily click the \"Back\" button, muttering a curse under their breath.  Dr. Merlin has been known to pound her keyboard in frustration when she finds herself stuck in a quagmire of unnecessary details, and it's not the fun kind of frustration.\n\nExposition is not a friend to writers.\n\nEven seasoned writers like Dr. Merlin still fall prey to long, meandering passages that leave nothing but a sense of tedium in their wake.  We know the essential writing tip: \"Show, don't tell,\" but it's a hard habit to break.  Exposition is that pesky voice in our heads that whispers, \"Get the backstory over with so we can get to the good stuff\" (not to be confused with the voice that urges us to reveal every intimate detail of our characters' pasts).\n\nSo, what is exposition? It's the act of telling the reader what's happened, usually in straightforward language.  In film, it's the scene where one character dumps a load of information on another (think \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\").  In fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nLet's take a look at an example.  Imagine a story where the heroine meets her beloved, gets married in a grand ceremony, and her husband is brutally murdered before her eyes.  You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to unfold over two pages, with both characters only uttering a few words.  You'd want to see more of the husband's character come alive through his words and actions, and the heroine's transformation as she falls in love with him.  You'd want to feel the depth of their bond, the impact his presence has on her life, and the clues that hint at her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams.  By doing this, you'd become invested in his fate and hers, and mourn his loss alongside her.  That's what makes a story come alive - the meat on the bone of the plot: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs writers, we need to provide that meat.  Sometimes it's tempting to rush past certain details, but the payoff is worth the extra effort.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and know he used to be in the Air Force, now works the night shift at a gas station, has been married twice, has no kids, and dreams of owning the gas station someday.  Don't just give the reader a laundry list of facts - show us through his actions, dialogue, and expressions why these details matter.  Give your readers a reason to care about this character and the world you're creating.",
            "I tuned in to the local news from Columbus, Ohio, and witnessed two newscasts, one on August 13, 2011. The first one, NBC 4's live broadcast in the morning, caught my attention with a particularly disturbing story. A man named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio, had allegedly stabbed his wife, though her name was not mentioned. His mug shot was displayed, and he looked every inch the embodiment of malevolence. Not surprisingly, this developing story received only two minutes of airtime. I think they devoted an adequate amount of time to the story, considering its gravity.\n\nThe second story told the heart-wrenching tale of an 18-year-old named Travis Buyers, who was shot in the Sharon Woods area. He was left critically injured, and at the time, no arrests had been made or suspects identified. The SWAT Team was hot on the case. I couldn't help but feel that this story received short shrift, and I suspect the reason might be rooted in the fact that the victim was a young black man from a predominantly black neighborhood. I've observed this phenomenon before – minorities are often overlooked when they're victims of crime. In contrast, when a white child or adult falls victim, the media sensationalizes the story, whereas a minority victim is lucky to receive minimal coverage. \n\nSubsequent stories included an investigation into a gunshot hole found on a Med-Flight helicopter. Details were provided about the possible location of the incident, and it was determined that a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle was responsible. Crime-Stoppers offered a substantial reward, $5,000, for any information leading to the arrest of the perpetrator.\n\nThe forecast for the weekend mentioned rain and thunderstorms on Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to hover in the mid-to-low eighties. The segment was brief, but I suspect the anchor wanted to use it as a teaser to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nAnother story highlighted the robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The perpetrator, described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt, was allegedly around six feet tall and weighed around 150 pounds. I found it striking that they devoted an inordinate amount of time to emphasizing the robber's skin tone and the darkness of his complexion.\n\nLastly, a story reported on Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas-based marijuana kingpin who had been sentenced to 300 months in prison for conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana to Ohio from Texas. I couldn't help but notice that they chose to mention his Hispanic heritage, which seemed irrelevant to the story. It left me wondering if they thought it added a layer of gravity to the narrative or if it was simply a gratuitous detail.",
            "There's an unbreakable bond between brothers, a connection that runs deeper than words can express. This bond is a complex web of emotions - love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty - all intertwined like the threads of a rich tapestry. Brothers have a unique understanding of each other, one that transcends the boundaries of ordinary relationships. When the chips are down and things get tough, the true nature of this bond is revealed, whether it's beautiful or ugly. The cost of this bond is steep, and it's only when we confront the consequences of our actions that we can truly understand its power. When we look at our brother and see our own reflection staring back, we're forced to confront the truth about ourselves - our flaws, our strengths, and our true character. This is a theme that's expertly woven throughout William Faulkner's \"The Scarlet Ibis\", a haunting tale of two brothers locked in a dance of emotions. Set against the backdrop of a lush, vivid landscape, their journey is a futile yet poignant one, marked by the bitter clash of disappointment and pride. Ultimately, only one brother emerges unscathed, leaving the other to grapple with the devastating consequences of their actions.\n\nAt the heart of this story is the protagonist's all-consuming pride. From the moment he and his little brother, Doodle, set out together, he's driven by a sense of resentment towards the younger boy. He'd envisioned a brother who could share in his adventures, who could keep up with his wild spirit and thirst for excitement. But Doodle's fragile health dashes those hopes, leaving the protagonist feeling frustrated and angry. He's even shown to harbor a dark secret - a desire to eliminate the perceived burden that Doodle represents. Yet, in a subtle yet telling moment, his defenses crumble when he catches Doodle's smile. This fleeting glimpse of joy humanizes the protagonist, revealing a love for his brother that's been there all along. It's a love that's not always easy to acknowledge, but it's a love that ultimately redeems him.\n\nThrough the protagonist's actions and interactions with Doodle, Faulkner masterfully explores the complexities of brotherly love and the consequences that come with it. The narrator's perspective adds another layer of depth to the story, offering a glimpse into the protagonist's inner world and the emotions that drive him. As we follow the brothers on their fateful journey, we're forced to confront the darker aspects of human nature - our own flaws, our own capacity for cruelty and love. In the end, it's a powerful reminder that the bonds we form with others are the greatest teachers of all, and that it's only by confronting our own reflections that we can truly grow and change.",
            "I've often found myself wondering about the intricate workings of the human brain, a complex information-processing system that's as baffling as it is fascinating. Over time, our understanding of the brain has evolved, much like the technology that's revolutionized our lives. We've likened it to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, then a book, and more recently, to a computer. While these metaphors have been helpful in describing the brain's functions, they also have their limitations, often leading us down a path of misconceptions.\n\nThe journey of information processing begins with the sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli like touch, heat, and light into electrical signals. This process is a series of transformations, where the brain's algorithms work their magic, both bottom-up and top-down. For instance, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing assembles basic information like color, orientation, and object borders to determine that you're seeing a box. Meanwhile, top-down processing uses the decisions made earlier to expedite your recognition of the box, perhaps helping you identify it as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole.\n\nAs information is processed to some extent, an attention filter decides its importance and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name in a noisy room. This process of processing and filtering is repeated at multiple stages, with attention modulating the results each time.\n\nFor the brain to process information effectively, it must first store it. There are various types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. Information is initially encoded, with different types of encoding suited to each type of sensory stimulus. For instance, verbal input can be encoded structurally, phonemically, or semantically. Once information is stored, it needs to be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores info for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a specific series of neurons for a short period. Long-term memory, on the other hand, is thought to be maintained in the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are numerous models of how knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on human subjects' memory retrieval, others inspired by computer science, and others rooted in neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented by nodes, connected based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In his seminal novel Brave New World, Aldous Huxley issues a dire warning about the dangers of unchecked technological advancement and the capitalist systems that fuel it. His dystopian vision paints a picture of a future where individuals are conditioned to prioritize short-term happiness above all else, surrendering their autonomy to a rigid community that suppresses individuality. The citizens of this world are mere pawns in a game controlled by the World Controller, forced to conform to a single ideology that permeates every aspect of their lives. A closer examination of the text through the lens of Marxist theory reveals Huxley's scathing critique of the emerging economic systems of his time, with Marxist concepts like homogeny and reification providing a framework for understanding the novel's underlying themes.\n\nHuxley's satirical take on capitalism is particularly noteworthy, as he employs the Marxist concept of false consciousness to highlight the ways in which the common citizenry is kept in the dark about the true nature of their relationships with other economic classes. The people are conditioned through hypnopædia to crave consumption, indulgence, and self-gratification, effectively rendering them pawns in a game controlled by the ruling elite. The lower classes, exemplified by the Delta and Gamma castes, are oblivious to the manipulation, while the upper classes, represented by the Alphas and Betas, are complicit in their own oppression, refusing to challenge the status quo.\n\nThe relationships between individuals in Brave New World are shallow and lacking in depth, suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism is eroding humanity's capacity for genuine emotional expression and free will. Love, in particular, is absent from this world, replaced by superficial interactions that prioritize physical appearance over substance. The societal classes' complacency with their assigned roles in the hierarchy serves as a testament to the insidious effects of capitalist ideology, where individuals are conditioned to believe they are superior to others as long as they conform and consume.\n\nHuxley's work offers a searing indictment of the dehumanizing effects of capitalist systems, where individuals are reduced to mere automatons, devoid of autonomy and agency. By exploring the intersections of technology, capitalism, and human relationships, Huxley challenges readers to consider the consequences of creating a world where individuality and free will are sacrificed for the sake of efficiency and conformity.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for nearly three years now, or roughly five semesters. For many, including myself, navigating this campus can be a real challenge. My first year, I was stuck in an East Halls dorm room, essentially the easternmost outpost of campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Commuting from my Stuart Hall digs to classes in places like the Willard building, which is actually closer to the center of campus, would take around 25 minutes on foot, especially when the weather's less than ideal, which is often the case in State College. I had a conversation with an alum not much older than me, and it turns out that not so long ago, the East Halls dorms were isolated from the rest of the school by huge swaths of empty land. Today, that vacant space has been transformed into sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and the health services building, and swanky new apartments. As the campus continues to expand, getting around becomes increasingly complicated. So, what's the solution to this mobility conundrum? On a college campus, I firmly believe that the bicycle is the answer. However, a bike alone won't solve the problem; students need to ride them, and the campus architecture needs to accommodate the needs of bicyclists.\n\nI recently spoke with a friend who's recently taken up bicycling again after a hiatus, and he confessed that he wondered why he stopped in the first place. \"Bikes are great,\" he said, \"for a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Not only is bicycling good for your physical health, it's also the most efficient mode of transportation. A bowl of oatmeal and a bit of physical exertion can take you 30 miles or more. Like many of my fellow undergrads, I currently live off campus, just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. I made the smartest decision of the year when I bought a bike. I have class every day in Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my place. With a bike, I can cut that time down to just 5 minutes if I pedal hard enough. The only catch is that Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas building from my house, isn't always the most bike-friendly road. There are pros to walking, of course, but personally, I'm too busy to walk. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option, and it would take around 30-40 minutes each way, adding up to over two and a half hours every week. Factor in all the other time I'd spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and the like, and that's more time than I can spare."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "While pursuing my education in social work, I've found myself drawn to a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services, where I hope to make a difference in the lives of children who've been victimized or neglected, as well as offer support to families in crisis. As I delve deeper into this field, I've come to realize that the values I bring to the table – service, respect, and an unwavering commitment to ethics – are not only essential to the social work profession, but also deeply personal to me. I've always been driven to help others, though I've struggled to pinpoint the perfect career path. Throughout high school and college, I watched as people dodged their problems or employed coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. As I navigated this uncertainty, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, but even that didn't provide the clarity I was seeking.\n\nA pivotal moment arrived when I spent the summer after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. I visited a friend, and she introduced me to a 16-year-old boy who was anxious and skittish on her couch. She explained that he had come to escape his abusive parents, and the next day, I learned he'd called the police to their residence. Feeling compelled to act, I drove to his parents' house, where I discreetly discussed my concerns with the authorities and revealed my recent psychology degree. The police asked me to speak with the parents since there was little they could do for the teenager. As I questioned them, they seemed evasive and made excuses for their son's behavior, labeling it as \"manipulative\" and a \"simple dispute.\" This experience jarred me into seriously considering a career in social work, particularly in helping children navigate family conflicts.\n\nSocial justice is another fundamental value that resonates deeply within me. As a society, we tout individuality, yet often prioritize conformity. We mourn those we've lost, yet strive to be like everyone else. I'm an individual, and I refuse to conform to societal expectations. Throughout high school and college, I consistently spoke out against social injustice – through bold fashion choices, declarations of support for the GSBA, and fighting against racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it. I believe in the power of social justice and will continue to challenge the status quo.",
            "The relationship between insomnia and its underlying causes is a multifaceted issue that can be approached through two distinct models: the biological and sociocultural models. While the biological model delves into the genetic and physiological aspects of sleep disorders, the sociocultural model examines the environmental factors that influence an individual's sleep patterns. In this review, we will delve into the intricacies of insomnia, exploring the various categories of sleep disorders and how they relate to these two models. We will also critique the research that supports each model, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nInsomnia can manifest in different forms, including primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders linked to mental health issues, and sleep disorders caused by medical complications or substance use. Within the primary sleep disorders category, we find the Dyssomnias, which encompass a range of conditions, including Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia is characterized by difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is marked by excessive daytime sleepiness. Narcolepsy, on the other hand, is associated with cataplexy and automatic REM sleep.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders focuses on the genetic and physiological factors that influence sleep patterns. Research has shown that the hypothalamus, a region in the brain, plays a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for this regulation, and studies have discovered that the activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while its inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and increased sleep time. For instance, a study involving mice found that the activation of the GABAB receptors on orexin neurons can induce sleep, and the use of the GABAB agonist, baclofen, increased sleep time. These findings suggest that there is a genetic basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans, and alterations in this receptor can impact an individual's ability to sleep without medication.\n\nThe sociocultural implications of this research are significant, as they suggest that inherited genetic traits can influence an individual's sleep patterns. If an individual inherits a phenotype that affects the GABAB receptor, it could naturally disrupt their sleep, leading to problems in various aspects of life, such as school, career, and daily tasks that require focus. This highlights the importance of considering both biological and sociocultural factors when understanding and addressing insomnia.",
            "I'm still trying to wrap my head around Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It's a condition that affects how the central nervous system processes what we hear. Simply put, it's not that people with CAPD can't hear, but their brains have trouble making sense of the sounds they pick up. It's like having a radio that receives the signal, but the dial is stuck on static – the brain's ability to distinguish words, conversations, and background noise is all over the place.\n\nCAPD has been around since the 1950s, when researchers first identified it as \"auditory imperception.\" The Italian team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari developed the first tests for kids with communication disorders back in 1954. Fast forward to the 1970s, and a national conference sparked a wave of research into CAPD.\n\nSo, what does CAPD look like in action? Some people might struggle to pinpoint where sounds are coming from, while others might have trouble telling two sounds apart. They might not be able to recognize patterns or differentiate between changes in speech, like when someone's voice changes tone to indicate sarcasm. Imagine trying to decipher a code without the decoder ring – it's like that. And if one sound gets drowned out by another, it's like trying to hear a whisper in a busy restaurant.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, professionals like audiologists and speech-language pathologists use a combination of observation and testing. They might give patients questionnaires, observe their reactions to different stimuli, or even record the electrical signals in the ear to see how the brain responds. It's a complex process, and there's no single test that stands out as a clear winner. The unknown cause of CAPD only adds to the mystery.\n\nAs a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom, it's essential to be aware of the red flags that might indicate a student has CAPD. By being attuned to these cues, you can provide extra support and create a more inclusive learning environment. It's all about being sensitive to the ways CAPD can affect a student's ability to learn and succeed.",
            "It seems that Shakespeare's Twelfth Night conveys the idea that while disguising oneself can facilitate deception on a grand scale, ultimately, embracing one's true self is essential to avoid losing oneself in the process. One of the challenges in shedding a disguise, however, lies in the risk of alienating those around us. In some cases, people may react with indifference to being deceived, while others, understandably, might take offense to the charade. This raises the question of prioritizing one's own identity versus preserving relationships with others. \n\nGender role reversal, in particular, adds a layer of complexity, as it prompts us to ponder the motivations behind such a disguise. Take Viola, for instance, who dons a masculine guise to safeguard herself in a foreign land. Her ruse works, but it also isolates her from her female support system and, as it turns out, even causes her to be mistaken for Sebastian, leading Olivia to fall for her. Viola also grapples with suppressed feelings for Orsino, whose words suggest a hidden attraction to her. \n\nIn a way, Twelfth Night can be seen as a commentary on how deception can unveil repressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. The play hints that these characters might be harboring unconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to confront. The ease with which Olivia moves from infatuation with Cesario to a familial bond with Viola suggests that Olivia is more likely parodying the shallow judgments of her contemporaries, who often rely on surface-level appearances.",
            "I've witnessed firsthand the brutal legacy of German colonial rule, especially in its brutal treatment of the Ovaherero and Nama in what is now Namibia. However, no single phrase can encapsulate the complexities of a sprawling colonial empire. Just as the terrain varied, so did the policies and ruling styles of the German colonial empire. Educational provisions across the colonies were as diverse as the lands they occupied. When the British took over Tanganyika, they found a population of educated and literate Africans, a stark contrast to the situation in other colonies.\n\nIn South West Africa, however, the government abdicated its responsibility for native education, leaving most of it to underfunded missionary societies. Meanwhile, they lavished resources on European education, establishing state schools and tightly regulating missionary institutions. This disjointed approach had far-reaching consequences for the region, even long after German rule. While other colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, South West Africa remained largely untouched, uneducated, and illiterate. What drove this divergent experience? This essay seeks to shed more light on this issue by examining the complex interplay of social, political, and economic factors.\n\nThe existing literature on German colonial education is vast and mostly written in German, with many works dating back to the early twentieth century. These early studies mostly focused on describing the educational systems in place. Later studies, written in English, delved deeper, comparing education systems across colonies and analyzing specific aspects in greater detail. Notably, Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa laid the groundwork for this discussion. By comparing the two colonies, Cohen identified the significant differences in their educational systems, attributing many of them to the large settler population in South West Africa.\n\nSouth West Africa's climate was relatively mild, albeit with vast expanses of arid desert. This relatively hospitable environment attracted a sizeable settler population. By 1913, nearly 15,000 Europeans called South West Africa home, far outpacing the 5,336 settlers in East Africa, the next largest colony.",
            "Fast forward a century, and the landscape of popular music has undergone a seismic shift, with genres mushrooming like weeds in a fertile field. It's a daunting task to pin down every single one of them, and the situation is further complicated by the fact that most popular genres – think rap, rock, country, jazz, folk – have given birth to their own mini-genres within their domain. But if there's one genre that's taken the cake for diversity and expressiveness, it's Heavy Metal, which has evolved over the past four decades into a behemoth of a genre that's as dark as it is bold.\n\nThe beauty of Heavy Metal lies in its chameleon-like ability to adapt and transform, giving birth to an endless array of sub-genres and sub-sub-genres that continue to sprout and grow. Today, with the genre having become a vast, sprawling entity, it's tricky to pinpoint exactly what constitutes Heavy Metal. This is because it's incorporated elements from other genres, yet its roots are firmly planted in a particular tradition. To truly understand the Heavy Metal phenomenon, we need to delve into its core, exploring what makes it a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nAt its heart, Metal is a genre defined by its affinity for the darker side of life. It's music that's loud, raw, and unapologetic, often incorporating elements of the dramatic and the theatrical. Bands that make Metal music are known for their technical prowess, with musicianship that's polished and refined. And let's be honest – Metal has long had a reputation for being a genre that's heavily influenced by substances that alter the mind. The psychedelic boom of the 1970s led to a proliferation of records that were truly out of this world, with musicians using their experiences under the influence as a creative wellspring.\n\nMetal's visceral qualities are a major part of its appeal, offering a sonic landscape that's often bleak and unflinching. This was a radical departure from the more upbeat, feel-good music that dominated the airwaves in the past. Later generations of Metal musicians drew inspiration from the Romantic Era's emphasis on the darker, more intense aspects of human experience. Lyrics like those found in Helter Skelter, often cited as one of the first Heavy Metal songs, perfectly capture the genre's affinity for the shadows. This Beatles' classic, with its moods that swing wildly between euphoria and despair, showcases the darker side of human emotion, a staple of the Metal movement.",
            "I still get a kick out of thinking about the early days of Surrealism, when artists like those associated with the movement started crafting their dreamlike masterpieces. But there was one artist who was actually painting his dreams – literally and figuratively – years before the Surrealists came on the scene. I'm talking about Henri Rousseau, a Post-Impressionist master who created The Dream in 1910, a painting that not only showcases a woman in awe of the wonders of a dreamland but also reveals Rousseau's own aspirations and struggles as an artist.\n\nRousseau's dream was to be recognized, accepted, and praised by his peers and the art world. But he found himself torn between conforming to the styles of the time to gain acceptance and staying true to his unique vision. This internal conflict is the very essence of The Dream, a work that reflects Rousseau's lifelong struggle to balance his desire for artistic individuality with the pressure to conform to the expectations of the art world.\n\nTo truly understand the significance of The Dream, you need to know a bit about Rousseau's backstory. Born on May 21, 1844, in the French town of Laval, Rousseau grew up in a relatively affluent family – his father was a prosperous tinsmith and hardware dealer. However, he didn't receive any formal art training, and instead, worked as a municipal toll collector until he was forty. But art was his true passion, and after his first wife's untimely death, which was followed by the loss of eight infant children, he turned to painting as a way to cope with his grief and find a new sense of purpose.\n\nUnlike many of his contemporaries, who romanticized and sentimentalized the peasant class in their art, Rousseau was a folk painter who created works that reflected the hopes and dreams of the average working-class person. Given his late start in life and the fact that he was producing art alongside more established artists, it's no wonder that Rousseau felt pressure to be accepted by the art world. He didn't gain widespread recognition until around the same time that Matisse was starting to make a name for himself. As art historian Jan Gordon noted, while Matisse was driven by a desire to avoid painting in a mundane way, Rousseau's goal was to create conventionally beautiful works that would earn him a spot in the prestigious Artiste Français.",
            "Throughout history, great thinkers have been insistent on the deep connection between ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. I believe there's a profound reason behind this. As John Keats so eloquently put it in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty— That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Our understanding of the world is largely shaped by education and experience, yet we somehow instinctively grasp the value of ethics and aesthetics, as Keats suggests. Both ethics and aesthetics are about describing, not prescribing. Our studies of morality and beauty are essentially attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than providing a set of rigid rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nTo put it more directly, criticism of art or morals can never fully capture the essence of what's good or beautiful. Discussions about the worth of the Mona Lisa, for example, might revolve around concepts like composition, contrast, or cultural context, but ultimately, these don't explain why it's good art. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often respond with a phrase like, \"There's just something about it,\" followed by a more intricate or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be reduced to a simple description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor astutely observed, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we describe the properties of a work of literature, there's always something left unspoken. Similarly, I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein noted, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I propose that it's this \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, which makes art and morality so powerful, and that their transcendental nature provides a common ground between them.\n\nI believe that morality and art are closely linked because we experience both most intensely at a fundamental, noumenal level, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be felt, but not fully explained. This connection is even stronger when it comes to literature. As McKean points out, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany's unity is what makes it a force to be reckoned with today. From the shadows of the Alps in München to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel, the country boasts a unique culture that's a blend of its diverse heritage. This cultural fusion can be felt throughout, from the Rhine River city of Köln to the heart of Germany, all the way to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. Given its rich history, it's no surprise that modern Germany is a melting pot of various cultures and tribes.\n\nThe birthplace of the Germans is known as Germania, but its origins are shrouded in mystery. Historians and scholars are still debating the name's roots. Tacitus believed it stemmed from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were previously known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and clashed with the Gauls. Julius Caesar, on the other hand, used the term \"Germanus\" in his account of the Gallic Wars, where he battled the Gauls and Germanic tribes that often crossed the Rhine with a mischievous agenda. Caesar coined this term from the Gauls themselves, using it to differentiate between the conquered Gauls and the unconquered Germanic tribes. In his first book, Caesar notes, \"The Germans, who live beyond the Rhine, continually wage war with the Gauls.\" Some theorize that the name \"German\" comes from the Gaulish language, while others propose it derived from the spear used in warfare, known as a ger. Another theory suggests it originated from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" possibly indicating the Germans were loud and boisterous.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus, in his 98 AD writing \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" provides insight into the origins of the Germans, describing them as aboriginal and unadulterated by other cultures. He writes, \"Who would leave Asia or Africa for Italy, for Germany with its harsh climate, unforgiving skies, and rough demeanor, unless it were their homeland?\" The Romans, at least initially, showed little interest in settling in Germany, preferring to conquer and trade with the Germanic tribes instead. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they lived on the fringes of the Roman Empire, exchanging goods and skills with the Romans, who valued their military prowess and services within the Roman army.",
            "I stood blankly in front of the toilet, my mind a complete blank slate. Thoughts ping-ponged through my brain, but nothing stuck. It was as if I'd become a vessel for the visual landscape before me, a mere observer detached from my own thoughts. My consciousness whirled through the scene like water, effortlessly flowing from one moment to the next. The image of the offending brown package in the toilet bowl stared me down, but I didn't feel a thing. It was almost as if I'd disconnected from my own emotions, observing the world with a practiced lack of attachment.\n\nI used to be fascinated by art, ever since I was a kid. As an adult, I finally bought a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" – advice from a friend and fellow artist. It promised to teach me the ropes, from the basics of understanding what a pencil is to the intricate processes our brains use to decipher lines. One technique caught my eye: framing a picture within a square. It's supposed to break down a complex scene into something manageable, transforming a messy bowl of fruit on a cluttered kitchen table into a simple, contained image. But at that moment, gazing at the toilet, I couldn't fathom the concept. I was overwhelmed, awestruck, and could only stand there, frozen in wonder.\n\nArtistic influences swirled through my mind – Picasso's blue period, Monet's love of greenery, the Renaissance masters' kaleidoscope of colors. If I dared to imagine myself as an artist, this was my chance to start something new, something worthy of the title. I had titled it \"Work in Brown\" in my mind. I reached for my trusty pencil, my hand flexing as I prepared to bring my vision to life. My muscles tensed, relaxed, and tensed again, as if ready to dance.\n\nBut instead, my hand smacked the toilet handle once, twice, with a growing sense of frustration. The offending package refused to budge, stuck like a stubborn slug on the bottom of the toilet. I stood, a mop in hand, my tie feeling constricting around my neck. A few more flushes, a few more moments to collect myself, and I reached for the toilet paper roll, wrapping my hand in a makeshift mitten. I stooped, dipping into the toilet bowl like a mother preparing the Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "The alarming statistics about teenagers behind the wheel are a sobering reminder of the perils of driving at a tender age. Several factors contribute to this grim reality, and the National Institutes of Health shed light on the brain's unreadiness for the dangers of driving as one crucial element. The lack of experience is another significant factor, leading to a higher frequency of fatal accidents, rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road. \n\nTeenagers, in particular, are more accident-prone when accompanied by their peers, which, as we all know, happens frequently. A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center revealed a telling correlation between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\nIn an effort to curb this trend, some states, including California, have implemented provisional driver's licenses that restrict the hours and passengers for teen drivers. However, I believe these measures are merely a temporary fix. The core issue lies in the fact that, statistically speaking, the youngest drivers are not equipped to handle the risks and responsibilities associated with driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman's research suggests that 18 is still too early for a full driver's license, as those under 19-20 tend to be thrill-seekers. Delaying driving licenses until this impulse subsides could save countless lives. Continuing to issue licenses to young teens will only lead to more tragic accidents and a staggering death toll in the coming years, particularly when millions of new teen drivers hit the road by 2010, the year the Baby Boomers' children become eligible.\n\nImplementing legislation to address this issue would be a relatively straightforward process. Schools could continue to offer driver's education classes to lay the groundwork for future drivers, but no one under 18 should be allowed to operate a vehicle. A provisional permit could still be issued before granting a full license, and a set number of practical training hours could be required. This number could be based on the existing standards of most states, such as California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult. Uniform national legislation would be a reasonable and effective way to protect teenagers across the country. This idea is not a new one, but it's a sound solution to a pressing problem.",
            "I decided to dive into the Library of Congress's treasure trove of early Edison films, specifically the trick films from 1895 to 1901. There are 15 of them in total, and I found myself captivated by their creative use of editing to conjure illusions. My exploration of these films focused on analyzing the poetic elements that make them tick and identifying the progressive characteristics that set some of the later films apart. At the turn of the century, trick films were largely static, confined to a single, frontal proscenium, and adhered to a strict one-shot-per-film rule, with a focus on long and medium shots. However, a few early 20th-century films dared to break free from these conventions by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nOne thing that stood out to me was the common thread of filming within an interior set, framed within a frontal proscenium. The camera remained stationary, refusing to follow figures or objects as they moved. This composition drew its roots from the theatre and, for trick films, the world of vaudeville and magic shows. A limitation of this setup was that figures in trick films were generally confined to side-to-side movement, unable to approach or recede from the camera. Take, for instance, the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where the actors enter from the right and move back and forth along the horizontal axis, disappearing from view without the camera following them.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style also led to a reliance on long shots, with medium shots appearing less frequently. Close-ups were nonexistent in these early trick films, a nod to the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would witness the entire performance from a fixed vantage point. As in many early films, actors rarely moved towards the camera, making close-ups a rarity. Most trick films from the Edison catalog stuck to the rule of one conceptual shot per film, keeping their length brief – typically under a minute, depending on the frames per second used. This constraint limited the dramatic and narrative potential of these films, which often focused on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearances, and switching acts with minimal storytelling. However, a closer examination of these films revealed that what appears to be one physical shot can, in fact, be several joined together to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance, as seen in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), where a more detailed inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the entire film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "Meet John Taylor of Caroline, a true pioneer in the realm of Republicanism. As a passionate advocate for individual liberties and limited government, his unwavering dedication to these causes was forged in the fires of his agricultural pursuits and brief foray into politics. While his work as a farmer formed the foundation of his views on governance, it was his conviction in the superiority of agrarian life that colored his opinions on sovereignty, constitutionalism, and the judiciary.\n\nTaylor believed that the United States possessed a unique opportunity to craft an ideal system of government, untainted by the influence of native traditions. This blank slate allowed him to envision a system of self-governance that would safeguard the inherent rights of individuals, which he believed were interdependent and indivisible. If one right was compromised, the value of all others would suffer. Consequently, these rights should be beyond the reach of government meddling. In his view, the so-called \"state of nature\" was a chaotic realm where the strong preyed on the weak, but he believed that civilization should not perpetuate this paradigm.\n\nTo create an ideal society, Taylor posited that a government must be established that acknowledges the duality of human nature – its propensity for both good and evil. He was resolute in his adherence to a dualistic morality, arguing that government, being an extension of humanity, would reflect both its virtues and vices. Taylor defined good principles as those that protected private property, promoted agriculture, and discouraged excessive capitalism. He contended that a government grounded in these principles would function impartially, despite the inevitable presence of self-interest and avarice in its administration. However, he believed that self-interest was only malevolent when it led to the proliferation of sub-societies that exploited others at the expense of the greater good. A benevolent government was necessary to contain humanity's darker tendencies, and it must be vigilantly monitored to prevent the introduction of pernicious principles.\n\nLike many stalwart Republicans of his time, Taylor championed a strict construction of the Constitution, advocating for a minimalist federal government with only the powers explicitly granted to it. He recognized that an expansive federal government was prone to despotism due to its associated costs. However, Taylor cautioned against a literal interpretation of the Constitution, warning that it could lead to corruption without consideration for the intent of its authors. Moreover, he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it more explicitly described the country as a federation of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Looking back at the data in Figure 17, we noticed a significant drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. This was a bit of a letdown, and it's tough to pinpoint the reason behind it. One possibility is that the onset of winter on our New England campus led people to abandon their bikes and foot-powered commutes, which could account for part of the decline. The end of the fall semester in December might also have played a role, as students and faculty were preoccupied with finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and the like, making it easy to overlook the commuter log. The start of the holiday season in December, followed by a month-long break for students and faculty, likely contributed to the low number of submissions. Things picked up again when classes resumed in late January, but the low numbers persisted through February. It's possible that the initial enthusiasm for the project wore off, leading to a natural decline in engagement. To counter this trend, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a special blitz campaign to revitalize the initiative, which succeeded in boosting log submissions for that month. However, this still left us grappling with the challenge of maintaining momentum despite the inevitable decrease in engagement due to holiday and semester breaks. Another hurdle for our project, and for any alternative commuting initiative, is the deep-seated cultural attachment to driving one's own vehicle. To overcome this, it's essential to offer incentives that appeal to people's love of freedom, independence, and flexibility on the road. We rewarded participants with gift cards to local eateries, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local bookstore, and even larger chain stores. It would have been interesting to see how bigger prizes might have impacted participation – perhaps a shiny new bike, a hybrid car, or an electric vehicle. This could have helped mitigate the dip in engagement we experienced. The prizes remained the same throughout the project, but if we had announced additional incentives over time, like a bike in December and a car in January, engagement might have increased instead of decreased.",
            "Imagine a financial product that's a hybrid of an index fund and a stock, offering the benefits of diversification and flexibility. That's what an exchange-traded fund, or ETF, is all about. Unlike a traditional mutual fund, an ETF allows you to buy and sell it on an exchange, much like a stock, but with the added advantage of tracking an index or a basket of assets. The allure of ETFs lies in their ability to provide diversification, the benefits of single stock ownership, and the flexibility to sell short, buy on margin, or purchase a single share in any transaction. But don't let that fool you - the expense ratios of ETFs are often lower than those of the average mutual fund. However, there's a catch: you'll need to pay a commission on every trade, just like you would with a stock order.\n\nThe real beauty of ETFs lies in their vast array of options, with various funds catering to different investment needs. But, it's crucial to keep in mind that even with these benefits, it's essential to scrutinize the actual performance of the ETF and its components. In this case, we're taking a closer look at the ETF IHF and its top 10 holdings, which account for a significant 63.58% of its assets. By examining these top holdings, we'll determine whether owning a single ETF can provide similar benefits to diversifying your portfolio with the same stocks.\n\nTo keep things concise, we'll focus on the top 10 holdings, representing the bulk of the ETF's assets. We'll use this subset to estimate how well the ETF's 10 stocks represent the entire fund. By calculating the Beta and return of a portfolio comprising only these 10 stocks, in the same proportions as the ETF's holdings, we can gauge their performance. The results are telling: a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings shows a 6.11% higher return, a whopping 16% increase, compared to the ETF. Moreover, the Beta of this portfolio is a full 0.12 lower than the ETF's, suggesting a potentially more stable investment.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that these findings might not be statistically significant. To confirm, we'll examine the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100%, and compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "I have always been fascinated by Edgar Allan Poe's magnum opus, \"Dream-Land.\" This enchanting poem is, in Poe's own words, one of his best works. One of the most intriguing aspects of \"Dream-Land\" is Poe's repeated use of the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56. According to the esteemed scholar Mabbott, this enigmatic reference can be traced back to the great Roman poet Virgil. Virgil, in his turn, borrowed the term from an ancient Greek concept, describing Thulé as an island situated at the edge of the known world, situated north of Britain.\n\nHowever, there's more to the story than meets the eye. Poe's fondness for German literature is well-documented, and it's likely that he drew inspiration from the works of the celebrated German author Goethe. Karl J. Arndt, in his seminal work \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" highlights the striking similarities between their two poems, concluding that Poe was, in fact, influenced by Goethe's writing.\n\nThe connection between Poe and Goethe is further cemented by Goethe's iconic poetic drama, \"Faust,\" which was published in two parts, with the first installment appearing in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe's passing. Within the second part of \"Faust,\" there's a poignant poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This haunting tale revolves around a king whose wife gives him a goblet before her passing, only to see him succumb to excessive drinking and despair. The king's eventual decision to give his possessions to his children and throw the goblet into the ocean, symbolizing his desire to join his beloved wife in death, bears an eerie resemblance to the demeanor of the speaker in \"Dream-Land.\" It's almost as if Poe's work is a dark mirror reflection of Goethe's, echoing his own struggles with loss and addiction.\n\nPoe's use of the term \"Thulé\" is more than just a coincidence, as he references it twice in his collected writings, including \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and \"Dream-Land.\" In fact, the two poems can be seen as companion pieces, with \"The King of Thulé\" serving as a haunting precursor to the desolate landscape of \"Dream-Land.\" The speaker's description of Thulé as a dark, lonely, and colorless world, haunted by the ghosts of departed friends, bears an uncanny resemblance to the king's own emotional state after the loss of his wife. This shared atmosphere of despair and longing suggests a deep connection between the two poems.\n\nIt's worth noting that Poe's admiration for Goethe was not limited to his own work. He also spoke highly of the English poet Tennyson, which would have introduced him to Goethe's writing. Moreover, the numerous reproductions of Goethe's work that followed its original publication would have ensured that Poe was well-versed in his literary legacy.",
            "You might wonder if a customer who slipped on a mess of applesauce at a grocery store and got hurt would be able to get punitive damages from the store manager, who ignored the spill for half an hour because he was too busy eating dinner. The manager had been informed twice about the spill, and even after that, he didn't do anything about it. But will a judge throw out the customer's claim right off the bat? \n\nI'd bet not. To get punitive damages, the customer will have to prove that the store manager acted with a reckless disregard for the harm that would come from leaving the spill there. They'll also have to show that the store manager's actions were despicable - basically, really bad and intentional. The customer has a good shot at this, considering that several other customers had slipped and fallen in the months before and the manager still did nothing to fix the problem. \n\nHere's the background: on October 13th at 5 pm, an employee told the manager, Paul Martin, about the applesauce spill, and he just blew him off, saying he was on his dinner break. Fifteen minutes later, another employee reminded him about the spill, and he gave the same response. Just half an hour later, the customer, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill and hurt her back. It turns out that this wasn't an isolated incident - five other customers had slipped and fallen at the store that same year. Now Palmer is suing the store for both compensation and punitive damages.\n\nIn California, a customer can sue for punitive damages if the store acted with malice - basically, if they intended to hurt the customer or showed a \"despicable\" disregard for the customer's safety. The law defines malice as acting with intent to harm or acting with a reckless disregard for others' safety, even if there's no intent to harm. It's like the court said in a previous case, when the defendant was aware of the potential danger of their actions and still chose to ignore it.",
            "It's been nearly four years since I took a course in Islam at CBC, a journey that sowed the seeds of a long-standing question: is Islam a hostile religion? As I reflect on the past two decades, I'm struck by the pendulum swing in public perception, oscillating wildly between hostility and excessive tolerance. The aftermath of 9/11 marked a turning point, as mass media shifted from a predominantly negative view of Islam to a more accepting stance. I find it astonishing that in 2001, it would have been unimaginable to have a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, whose family ties to Islam are undeniable.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad has long fascinated me, particularly the contradictions between history and the narrative's portrayal of his personality. In my understanding, Muhammad was supposed to be a forceful figure who coerced people into converting to Islam, conquering tribes and imposing his faith upon them. However, the biography presents a different picture – that of a humbled and misunderstood prophet, who humbled himself before others, and his message drew people to him one by one as they discovered the 'truth'. This dichotomy leaves me intrigued and, to a certain extent, perplexed.\n\nA striking parallel exists between the ministries of Jesus and the reported miracles of Muhammad. One notable example is the multiplication of mutton and milk, which was more than enough for forty men. This style of writing makes me believe that the authors aimed to depict Muhammad as a humble prophet, not one driven to prove himself, but one who lived in truth and miracle. This narrative strategy concerns me, as it diminishes the life and message of Jesus Christ, seemingly appropriating and diluting his significance. It's as if they're borrowing from and attempting to claim Jesus' legacy for Muhammad.\n\nFurthermore, the biography attributes great importance to providing evidence of 'witness' and how people 'independently' converted to Islam. However, many stories rely on hearsay, often tracing back to a third-party source. I found this approach off-putting, as it diminishes the stories' authenticity and makes them seem all the more suspicious.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this work is the attempt to elevate Muhammad to a godly figure, emphasizing his humility, gentle nature, and wisdom. Yet, historical accounts contradict this portrayal, and I can't help but wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true circumstances surrounding Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "It's fascinating to note that the core teachings of Jesus have largely been left in the dust as Christianity evolved over the centuries.  If we look at the broader timeline, it's clear that Christianity has gradually strayed further and further from its original roots.  Today, we're witnessing a growing awareness of this trend and an unprecedented desire for progress.  While traditionalists will undoubtedly resist any attempts to move beyond established dogma, their influence may ultimately be outweighed by those craving a deeper understanding of the faith's true origins.  As the years go by, historical awareness will become increasingly widespread among Christians, sparking a yearning to distinguish the doctrines that have been added to the faith from the intentions of its namesake.  This shift may take decades or even centuries, but the end result is inevitable:  Christianity will undergo a great reversal, progressing backward toward its original form.  A movement will gain momentum, shedding layer upon layer of doctrine as if time itself were rewinding, until all that remains is a glimpse of what Jesus brought to humanity on behalf of God, untainted by the interpretations of subsequent thinkers.  As this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, it will draw in the masses, influencing them to worship in a more authentic, Jesus-centric way.  The institutional church will remain strong, guiding the faithful on this journey back to the faith's roots.  However, this reverse trajectory will bring about a surprising consequence: instead of the rich diversity that has characterized Christendom, we can expect to see a growing uniformity of belief and practice across regions, denominations, and divisions.  History is replete with examples of this kind of reversal, such as how the Roman Empire, once a persecutor of Christians, eventually became a bastion of the faith.  Similarly, our country has transitioned from a time of African-American slavery to a era of African-American leadership.  The impending reversion in Christianity will be a remarkable process, undoing centuries of accumulated tradition in search of the original source, and in the process, erasing the very diversity that has come to define the faith.  Crucially, this transformation will be facilitated by a more nuanced approach to Jesus' words, viewing them as metaphors rather than literal statements.  So, what exactly happened since Jesus' time?\n       Looking further back into history, we find that the roots of Christianity lay firmly in Judaism.  By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., the core tenets of the faith were already in place: monotheism, a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures.  However, the Jewish population was far from unified, with various factions like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and common people vying for influence.",
            "The Jungle is an expose that reveals the darker side of human nature - a side where self-interest and greed reign supreme. Beneath the surface, we find individuals consumed by a never-ending pursuit of personal gain, with little regard for anyone or anything else. This is starkly evident in the portrayal of the factory owners and managers, who prioritize profit over people and the environment. As Upton Sinclair vividly illustrates, their relentless drive for growth and expansion leaves a trail of destruction in its wake, as seen in the image of \"the line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" Sinclair's depiction of the pollution and neglect is a scathing indictment of the owners' callous disregard for those affected by their actions.\n\nThe factory owners and managers also demonstrate a lack of concern for their employees, whom they treat as mere commodities to be exploited for their labor. They stop at nothing to maximize profits, regardless of the cost to the workers' well-being, as evident in the statement \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" The employees are subjected to grueling working hours, with little notice or support when they are laid off, often leaving them to fend for themselves in a system with few regulations to protect their rights. The book portrays a system where workers are expected to sacrifice their health and dignity for the sake of their jobs, with no safety net or support to fall back on.\n\nThe era in which The Jungle is set saw a lack of laws and regulations to safeguard workers' rights, allowing the factory owners and managers to operate with impunity. The unions that formed to represent the workers often ended up perpetuating the exploitation, profiting from the very people they were supposed to protect. As a result, the workers were trapped in a cycle of poverty and dependence, with little hope of escape. Sinclair's stark conclusion is that, in this system, immorality and desperation are inevitable, much like under the institution of slavery.",
            "The art of crafting a narrative that evokes a certain mood or attitude in readers is a delicate dance that many authors attempt to master. Not all of these techniques are equally effective, and F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel The Great Gatsby is a prime example of this. To create a lasting impression, Fitzgerald frequently employs a range of literary devices, including juxtaposing words that don't typically go together. He also assigns deeper meanings to symbols, which he then cleverly incorporates into his writing. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald expertly uses colors, like white/gray and red/pink, to build an aura around important subjects.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of Fitzgerald's use of color is the way he imbues white/gray with a sense of uniformity. To him, white connotes elegance and refinement, while gray represents something more aged and worn. He sets the stage for this association early on in the novel by consistently using these colors. For instance, Daisy and Jordan are often depicted wearing white, as are most other characters. Nick sports white flannels at Gatsby's party, Tom wears a white shirt when meeting Myrtle, and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white.\" Conversely, when Nick describes Gatsby's party, the atmosphere is described as \"gaudy with primary colors,\" implying that white is typically reserved for more subdued settings. Fitzgerald reinforces this association by applying these colors to everyday objects and people, such as the \"white chasms of lower New York\" Nick navigates every day, or the \"gray names\" on Nick's schedule.\n\nFitzgerald also uses white and gray to describe common, unremarkable people and places. For example, he describes Jordan and Daisy's shared \"white girlhood,\" the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes, and the \"gray old man\" selling dogs. By applying these colors to the mundane, Fitzgerald creates a sense of sameness, highlighting the monotony of everyday life.\n\nAfter establishing the meaning of white/gray, Fitzgerald uses them to convey a sense of unimportance or uniformity, particularly in relation to Daisy. After a pause in their use, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in a \"little white roadster,\" subtly suggesting that she has become a uniform, almost interchangeable part of Gatsby's world. This technique is repeated when Daisy is described as wearing a \"gray haze of fur collar\" and a \"white\" dress before her encounter with Tom and Gatsby. Through this use of color, Fitzgerald skillfully conveys Daisy's status as a desirable object, rather than a fully fleshed-out character.",
            "The land of San Diego County is a haven for agricultural bounty, thanks to its pleasant climate and an abundance of sunshine. Crops like tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, and peppers thrive in the area. With a strong demand for organic, community-supported agriculture, local farms have long waiting lists. Even organic eggs and milk are in high demand. Many of these farms open their gates to visitors, offering behind-the-scenes tours and opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other leisure activities. This type of operation not only allows landowners to tap into government incentives but also enables them to create a haven for wildlife, promoting biodiversity and offering a chance for educational programs and revenue streams.\n\nWhile organic farming can be a lucrative venture, it also has its own set of challenges. For one, it requires more labor and management to keep pests and weeds at bay without relying on chemicals, and losses can be greater than those experienced by conventional methods. Additionally, small organic farms often can't match the efficiency of larger operations, and practices like planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, and invasive species removal can be labor-intensive and costly. Considering these factors, a landowner in this scenario might seek financial assistance or expert guidance to optimize both profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe land in question is a 160-acre property in unincorporated San Diego County, adjacent to the town of Potrero. It's a diverse landscape of chaparral, nonnative grassland, and oak woodland, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. This area falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which currently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals, many of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the California gnatcatcher, while others are declining and may soon be listed.\n\nFor centuries, Native Americans inhabited this land before it was settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This particular piece of land was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing and wood production for many years.\n\nTo explore the possibilities for a small farmer on this land, I selected a real estate listing and researched government programs that could help mitigate costs and preserve wildlife-friendly practices. As a model of what someone farming this land might aim to achieve, I chose an organic farm in the same region.",
            "The impact of culture on negotiations cannot be overstated. Culture is a multifaceted entity that is often misunderstood or oversimplified. We frequently hear generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating,\" but these broad statements do little to illuminate the complexities of cultural attitudes. A more nuanced understanding of a culture can be gained by recognizing what it signifies and what it is not. In other words, culture is just as much about its absence as its presence.\n\nWhen approaching a foreign culture, we inevitably make comparisons to our own, which can lead to a superficial understanding. To truly grasp a culture, one must delve deeper, studying its history, understanding its prejudices, and acknowledging its idiosyncrasies. Rather than judging or trying to change a culture, it's essential to accept it for what it is and work within its boundaries, especially in the high-stakes world of negotiation.\n\nThe boundaries of culture extend far beyond national or international borders. Corporate cultures can be just as distinct as national cultures, with their own values, norms, and expectations. A company's dress code, communication style, and hiring practices can all reveal its underlying culture. For instance, some companies prioritize long hours in the office, while others encourage a more relaxed schedule. Even within a single company, regional and urban-suburban differences can create diverse subcultures.\n\nTo succeed in negotiation, it's crucial to understand the underlying values of a culture. If, for example, saving face or communal harmony is deeply ingrained in a culture, a negotiator will likely avoid public shaming or confrontation. Conversely, a culture that values a hard-driving bargain may not prioritize settling for a quick agreement. By considering these generalities before the negotiation table, a savvy negotiator can adapt their approach and build a stronger relationship with their opponent.\n\nMoreover, taking the time to learn about an opponent's personal values and motivations can be a game-changer in effective negotiation. By doing so, a negotiator can tailor their approach to the unique cultural context and create a more harmonious and productive discussion.",
            "I often wonder, 'What's the point of even arguing?' As the saying goes, \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" A phrase famously coined in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and later echoed in the writings of St. Anselm. This particular concept seems to be shared by the equally influential Thomas Aquinas, and as we delve into their works, it's clear that their arguments are intertwined. For the sake of simplicity, let's assume both authors believe in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. This allows us to focus on their arguments without getting bogged down in nuances. \n\nAs we explore their views, I'd like to suggest that while both St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas present compelling points, their approaches leave room for improvement. Let's start with Anselm's take. He posits that understanding God begins within ourselves. According to him, we can't fathom a world without God, so we must accept that God exists because it's inherent to our understanding. Anselm's idea is that our minds are the ultimate authority for determining the truth about God, and that external evidence is unnecessary. This concept is at the heart of Christian faith – a leap of trust without concrete proof.\n\nIn stark contrast, Thomas Aquinas takes a more empirical approach. He believes that God's existence can be proven through reason and evidence, freeing Christians from the need for faith. This would be a game-changer for evangelism, allowing converts to be wooed by logic rather than blind faith. Aquinas presents five distinct logical arguments for the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each of these demonstrates that the necessity of God is a logical inevitability, akin to understanding a missing puzzle piece by piecing together the rest of the puzzle.",
            "It all began sometime in the 5th or 6th century BCE with a prince destined to become the revered Buddha. Over the course of his life, he turned his back on worldly pursuits and discovered enlightenment. His teachings eventually gave rise to Buddhism – a 2,500-year-old tradition that has undergone significant transformations since its inception. This evolution can be observed in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is a poignant example. Despite the fact that Buddha never taught about such festivities, monks and lay followers alike participate in this ritual, making it a crucial aspect of their spiritual lives. This divergence from the original teachings is just one of the many ways in which Theravada Buddhism has adapted its theological and philosophical foundations over time. These changes have been influenced by both internal and external forces – some benevolent, others malevolent.\n\nThroughout this discussion, we will frequently use various terms to describe these forces. 'Internal' refers to influences stemming from within the Buddhist community, regardless of one's monastic status. External influences come from outside the community. A hostile force is any element that seeks to harm or damage the Buddhist community, often stemming from a negative perception of Buddhism. In contrast, a benign force has no intention to harm or assist the community, although it may inadvertently have one of these effects.\n\nLet's start by examining the fundamental principles of Theravada Buddhism – the core doctrines that have guided the community for centuries. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is comprised of the Tripitaka – the three baskets of sacred texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. These notions include the concepts of Anatta – the absence of a permanent self, Dukkha – the inherent suffering in life, and Anicca – the impermanence of everything. By acknowledging these fundamental truths, one can break free from Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, and ultimately eliminate lobha – desire, dosa – hatred, and moha – delusion. The Vinaya Pitaka outlines the rules for lay followers, such as the five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not engage in misconduct, and I shall not consume intoxicating substances). Monks, on the other hand, adhere to a more extensive set of disciplinary rules. The four noble truths form the foundation of Buddhist doctrine: the first, that life is suffering; the second, that attachment is the root cause of suffering; and the third, that suffering can be overcome.",
            "It's hard to believe how the United States and Mexico were once locked in a 57-year rivalry that lasted from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The rivalry reached its peak with the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the US came out on top, claiming Texas and the American Southwest as its own territory. This wasn't an isolated incident – there were many other clashes between the two nations before the First World War finally brought an end to the hostilities. \n\nThis long-standing rivalry was fueled by deep-seated differences between Americans and Mexicans on issues like faith, culture, and tradition (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31). Sound familiar? This isn't a unique scenario – neighboring nations often clash over competing interests, leading to enduring rivalries. The US and Mexico are just one example of a pair of nations that, despite sharing a border, struggled to see eye-to-eye. David M. Pletcher (1977) noted that Mexico and Cuba are the only Latin American nations that have presented long-term diplomatic challenges for the US (p. 41). It's no coincidence that they're both geographically close to the US and have a history of rivalry.\n\nReligious differences were a major point of contention between the two nations, a problem that has plagued many countries throughout history. As Sally Frahm (2001) pointed out, \"if Americans opposed fascism and communism in the 20th century, they were once opposed to Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries\" (p. 86). This ideological struggle was as much about competing interests as it was about differing values. In this case, the ideological differences were rooted in the religious preferences of the two nations, a legacy of the distrust between the English and Spanish empires. This inherited animosity made it difficult for the US and Mexico to establish a positive relationship.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) documented 17 disputes between Mexico and the US during the 57-year rivalry period. Most of these disputes centered on territorial issues, including border raids from Mexican territory and other frontier problems. Border violence, particularly from American border towns, was a persistent issue until the US and Mexico finally exerted military force to control their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).\n\nAs Schmitt (1974) noted, the rivalry began to subside as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the US (p. 109) and American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (p. 110) in the late 19th century. This marked the end of the long-standing rivalry between the two nations.",
            "It was 15 years ago that an unexpected illness suddenly rendered me unable to work. At the time, I was a nurse, a profession I had chosen for the security and stability it promised, a sense of safety I desperately craved as a child. The mantra that echoed through my adolescence and beyond was \"you'll always find work; people will always get sick.\" So, I put aside my dream of becoming a scientist or journalist to pursue a more practical path.\n\nNow, at 46, I'm single, broke, and living on the fragile support of Social Security Disability. Fifteen years have passed, and I've lost everything that truly belongs to me. Each day is a struggle, a relentless assault on my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. The only constant in my life is the unwavering support of my family and a few loyal friends, who've been my lifeline in times of crisis.\n\nDespite my strength, I've come to realize that when disaster strikes, it's a cruel illusion to think you can face it alone. Life's emergencies, whether big or small, are a guarantee. No amount of preparation can shield you from the overwhelming forces that life throws at you.\n\nI agree that our reliance on the government is a fragile foundation, but I firmly believe it's time for Americans to rediscover the value of trust, community, and mutual aid. Rather than building individual shelters, we should be learning to support one another, to ask for help when needed, and to offer a helping hand in times of need.\n\nThe concept of rugged individualism, touted by Conservatives as the backbone of American spirit, is a myth. Our forefathers didn't survive the harsh realities of frontier life alone; they thrived on compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains knew that working together was the only way to reach their destination.\n\nSo, by all means, prepare for the unexpected. I've stocked my disaster kit with essentials, from first aid supplies to water purification tablets and duct tape. I've got flashlights, batteries, candles, and canned goods, ready for any eventuality. But while you're at it, take a step further – get to know your neighbors.\n\nBy building connections and fostering a sense of community, we can create a safety net that's stronger than any government program or emergency kit. It's time to rediscover the values that truly made America great: compassion, mutual respect, and a willingness to help one another in times of need.",
            "I've always wondered, what drives organisms to evolve the way they do? Are there hidden rules, constraints that shape the path of evolutionary change? The field has been puzzling over this question for a long time, and even Darwin's contemporary, D'Arcy Thompson, noted in 1917 that scientists were still struggling to quantify the simplest forms of life. Fast-forward to today, and while we've made progress, we still have a long way to go. Recently, some scientists have applied mathematical modeling to the way mollusks grow their shells, looking at both how they develop over time (ontogeny) and how they've changed over millions of years (phylogeny). Our study is taking a similar approach, using math and experiments to figure out what drives the twists and turns of evolutionary change in a group of snails called Prunum.\n\nWe started by studying X-ray images of Prunum shells to identify key characteristics that could help us model how their shells might change over time. These characteristics were then plugged into a software program called CerioShell, which let us simulate different shell shapes and sizes. By comparing these hypothetical shells to real ones, we're hoping to get a better understanding of how Prunum shells have evolved over time.\n\nShells are like a spiral staircase, growing outward in a continuous loop. Each turn of the shell is called a whorl, and they're connected by a line called a suture. The largest whorl is the last one, called the body whorl, and the tip of the shell is the apex. As the shell grows, the animal extends out through an opening called the aperture. By looking at shells from different angles – apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural – we can get a better sense of their shape and size.\n\nTo count the number of whorls, you need to look at the shell from the top and find the first suture. Then, draw a line and start counting from there, estimating to a quarter of a whorl if necessary. By mapping out the path of the aperture through time and space, we can see how the shell has grown and changed over time. This journey can be represented mathematically and graphically, allowing us to experiment with different parameters and see how they affect the shell's development.\n\nBy combining math and experiments, we're one step closer to understanding the mysteries of evolutionary change in Prunum.",
            "For the past decade, Indonesia has witnessed a stagnation in neonatal and infant mortality rates.  While the country is making progress in achieving some of the Millennium Development Goals, such as water and sanitation targets, the rate of improvement in child and maternal health has fallen woefully short of the required target by 2015.  The multitude of factors behind this lag will be discussed below, suggesting a need to fortify the health system rather than focusing on programmatic interventions.\n\nIndonesia has seen an increase in the number of births attended by skilled healthcare workers, with 72% now meeting this benchmark.  However, this statistic also includes traditional attendants like midwives who cannot provide medical assistance in complicated cases, thus contributing to the high rate of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage.  Consequently, the improvements in this indicator are somewhat misleading, and there is still much work to be done.  Moreover, there has been a decline in the percentage of children under five treated by a healthcare professional for diarrheal cases.  The data on postnatal care is incomplete, but it is evident that this area is a concern, with low rates across the country.\n\nThe rate of cesarean sections remains alarmingly low at around 4%, and another red flag is raised by the fact that these rates are 7% in urban settings, but only 2% in rural areas.  This disparity highlights the issue of unequal access to healthcare services across the country, with urban areas receiving more attention.  The problem of vertical equity is also apparent, with a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, indicating that the poor are struggling to access healthcare services due to high out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen considering the next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most fundamental question is how to effectively address the shortage of services.  Specifically, should Indonesia opt for program-specific approaches or strengthen its overall health system without focusing solely on pre and post-pregnancy care for mothers and children?  While programmatic approaches to address the problems outlined may seem attractive, they have drawbacks.  For instance, heavily investing in a single area can divert resources away from other critical sectors, leading to a brain drain of human resources towards the more funded area.  Furthermore, running multiple parallel programs can result in duplication of services, uncoordinated efforts, and an increase in paperwork and administrative burdens.",
            "Victorian novels are often characterized by their meticulous attention to detail, frequently focusing on the aristocracy of the era.  However, two notable exceptions are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, which stray from this tradition by incorporating elements of mystery and the bizarre, characteristics not typically associated with Victorian fiction. These elements add depth to the characters within each novel, providing insight into their motivations and emotions.\n\nThe narrative of Oliver Twist is riddled with bewildering and confusing ideas as the protagonist navigates the dark world he inhabits. He finds himself caught between the turbulent lives of Sikes and Crackit, who are locked in a heated dispute. The words they exchange echo in his mind, making it difficult for him to distinguish reality from fantasy. In a state of disorientation, he's suddenly jolted back to reality by the sound of gunfire, and the world around him descends into chaos. A sense of unease and pain lingers, haunting him as he's whisked away by an unseen force. This passage from Dickens' work illustrates the unsettling nature of Oliver's world, where he's often overwhelmed by the harsh realities that surround him.\n\nOliver Twist and Wuthering Heights employ the use of dream sequences or dreamlike states to convey the mystery within their narratives. In Oliver Twist, these strange occurrences often reveal Oliver's inner turmoil, offering a glimpse into his deepest pains and fears. When the shooting incident is revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the moment vividly, as if stuck in a dream, while desperately searching for help. This passage underscores the lack of control Oliver has over the events unfolding around him, highlighting his dire situation and the trauma he's endured. As he's overwhelmed by the memory of the shooting, the question arises as to whose will is at play, suggesting that Oliver's misfortune may not be his own doing. This reinforces the idea that he's at the mercy of forces beyond his control, leaving him feeling defeated and powerless to act.\n\nSimilarly, Wuthering Heights is marked by long, oppressive nights that stretch on forever, yet seem to pass by in an instant. The day is always fleeting, and the silence is oppressive, making the hours feel like an eternity. This sense of timelessness is a fitting backdrop for the turmoil that unfolds within the novel.",
            "A couple of years ago, I was working with an after-school program where I tutored elementary-age students in various subjects. I did my best to help them in the areas where they were struggling, but my strengths lay in English and reading. One student, a young boy named Adrian, really caught my attention – he was in third or fourth grade, I think. He had a peculiar problem with reading, which only became apparent as I worked with him. Some letters were no-brainers for him, while others left him stumped, which was bizarre. Given his likely Latino background, I was taken aback by his perfect English skills, but it all started to make sense when I met his mother.\n\nThe moment she walked in, speaking only Spanish, it hit me like a ton of bricks: Adrian's literacy issues weren't about reading itself, but the English alphabet and its pronunciation. I realize now that my limited Spanish skills at the time made communication a bit of a challenge, but we managed to convey our message. That epiphany led me to wonder if that revelation ever helped him in the long run, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier issue in schools, particularly in California, and to show that it's not always as straightforward as we think. Even for kids who speak perfect English, reading can be a significant hurdle. I believe everyone acknowledges this problem, so what's the solution? In Adrian's case, it was as simple as targeted English reading tutoring, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for kids who barely speak English, it's a much more complex issue. There's no one-size-fits-all answer. We can't rely on any single method – dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutors, or ESL classes – to solve this problem. The key lies in combining multiple approaches.\n\nOne thing that stands out is the dual language system, which is an excellent idea not just for kids who speak Spanish as their first language but for all students. Research shows that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. A lot of misconceptions surround this idea, claiming it's a waste of resources and that most students won't benefit. But that's a false assumption. If we implemented these programs as the norm, rather than the exception, all children would benefit from them. So, how do we make it happen? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? That's unrealistic and unreasonable. Instead, I think we can have bilingual aids, tutors, or whatever we want to call them, to support students in the classroom.",
            "We've all been conditioned from a young age that there's something greater than ourselves, something that transcends our understanding. Some of us are raised in Sunday school, while others explore their spirituality through meditation or introspection. Many of us stick to the faith passed down to us by our parents, but some reject it altogether, opting instead for a more personalized worldview. We navigate a complex landscape of spirituality, searching for our own unique answers to the mysteries of the universe. Our quest for meaning often begins with a desire to escape the darkness and find solace in the light.\n\nOne rainy evening, I recall sitting on the porch with my father, watching the gutters overflow with rainwater, drowning the plants at the edge of the step. He stared out into the downpour, a look that was both distant and introspective. His health had taken a turn for the worse, and his once robust physique had given way to a more gaunt appearance. His hair had thinned, and his eyes seemed to be searching for something beyond the present moment. I felt a deep sense of unease and longing, but the words caught in my throat, unable to articulate the depth of my sorrow. I hugged him, sat back down beside him, and joined him in gazing out into the rain-soaked twilight, the sound of the raindrops a melancholy serenade.\n\nMy father passed away in December, just five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation had prolonged his life, but at what cost, I couldn't help but wonder. What kind of higher power would allow this suffering? In the dead of night, I found myself praying not to a deity, but to an empty void, as if pleading for an answer that never came. If there was a God, I thought, he had long since stopped listening to my pleas.\n\nI couldn't bring myself to witness my father's final moments. I chose to remember him by his life, not his passing. I knew him better than anyone else, and I knew he wouldn't have wanted me to be a spectator to his death. For three days, I curled up in my bed, waiting for the news that would change everything. But the silence was deafening – no one called to share the news with me.",
            "I've always found it fascinating how the term \"Gothic Novel\" seems to be an oxymoron - an \"old-new\" hybrid, as Ian Watt puts it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. For years, the Gothic mode has been both maligned and lauded, with some arguing it lacks depth and others praising its \"terrible sublime\" qualities (Burke). I suspect this duality stems from the genre's roots in a bygone era. The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, cleverly combined elements from both \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances to birth the proto-Gothic genre. By blending the old with the new, Walpole created a new form of literary expression. The Gothic genre drew inspiration from medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions, yet it was often seen as old-fashioned and unsophisticated in comparison to the \"modern\" literary and societal advancements of its time.\n\nOne of the defining characteristics of Gothic novels is the idea of chivalry, a medieval concept that emphasizes the virtues of a proper knight. This notion, as seen in The Castle of Otranto, is not only retained but also transformed. Chivalry, particularly in the context of the Gothic novel, represents an idealized and romanticized version of the past - a time when knights were brave, honorable, and competent. This nostalgic portrayal hints at the future evolution of Gothic into Romantic literature. Walpole, who wrote The Castle of Otranto during a tumultuous period, may have been attempting to critique the present by idealizing the past. His character Frederic, for instance, embodies many chivalric traits - he's a prince, a victim of tragedy, and a gallant and courteous figure. This exaggerated portrayal of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" sets the stage for the Gothic trope of excess.",
            "As I sit here, pondering the intricacies of the business world, I find myself reflecting on the concept of supply chain management - that intricate dance of moving goods from customer orders to raw materials, supply, production, and distribution, all the way to the customer's doorstep. It's a process that has been around since 1982, when consultant Keith Oliver coined the term. Oliver described the elaborate process of planning, implementing, and controlling the supply chain to satisfy customers' needs in a swift and efficient manner. The puzzle pieces of supply chain management revolve around six key elements: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information.\n\nA manager's best friend in this supply chain game is the production stage, the foundation upon which the entire process stands. It's the moment when the 'when, why, where, and how' of production is outlined. To get to this point, managers must tap into the market, that elusive indicator of customer demand. By studying the market, managers can determine what customers crave, and in turn, decide what products to produce, how many to produce, and where to produce them. It's a delicate balancing act, keeping in mind the customer's satisfaction and demand.\n\nOnce the production location is chosen, the focus shifts to scheduling workloads and equipment maintenance - a task that requires precision, as every detail counts. A minor misstep can cost a company dearly in the long run. I recall my days working at retail giants like Wal-Mart and Target, where every aspect of the business, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments, was meticulously planned out in a detailed booklet. Having a clear plan of action ensures that the company runs smoothly, without confusion or misdirection.\n\nSupply, the second key element in the supply chain management equation, involves strategic decisions about a company's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. It's a delicate dance of determining which divisions of production are best suited for each process, and when to outsource work to other companies. The goal is to create 'velocity' - the ability to provide quality, flexibility, and low costs. It's a juggling act that requires a manager's deft touch.",
            "A haunting message scrawled on a street corner, a stark reminder of the oppressed. Ellen Page, the talented star of Juno, stands alone, a cardboard sign held high above her head, the bold words \"Hitler is alive in Burma\" written in Sharpie. Burma, or Myanmar, a Southeast Asian nation ruled by a ruthless military junta that seized power in 1962 through a violent coup d'état. Just a decade ago, in 2007, a series of protests erupted, dubbed the \"Saffron Revolution,\" as thousands of Burmese monks took to the streets, donning their iconic saffron robes. The government, though initially tolerant, soon cracked down, unleashing a brutal crackdown on the peaceful gatherings. Journalists were arrested and foreign reporters, including Japanese photojournalist Kenji Nagai, were killed for simply bearing witness. The official death toll stands at 13, but Colonel Hla Win, a defector from the army, revealed a chilling truth: \"The bodies can be counted in several thousand.\"\n\nThis is just a grim snapshot of a timeless tale. The desire to silence dissent and maintain control has been a hallmark of governments throughout history. From ancient Rome, where emperors claimed divine right to rule, to modern-day leaders who seek to crush opposition, this pattern persists. Japanese emperors were considered gods, sent to guide their people towards prosperity, while our own president, George W. Bush, reportedly held clandestine meetings with Ted Haggard, leader of a fundamentalist group. The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China, the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, and, of course, the atrocities of the Third Reich all serve as stark reminders of the dangers of unchecked power.",
            "The inimitable legacy of Duke Ellington in the realm of jazz can be largely attributed to his remarkable longevity, which, in turn, allowed him to continually shape and evolve his orchestra. Though his piano playing is often understated in many of his compositions, Ellington's prowess as a composer is undeniable, particularly in his ability to craft rich, complex pieces that showcased the diverse talents of his band members. By carefully crafting the framework for improvisation, as well as writing intricately orchestrated passages that highlighted the unique styles of individual musicians, Ellington created a distinctive sound that was both original and coherent. His deep understanding of each player's voice and how they blended together in the ensemble enabled him to compose some of the most groundbreaking and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary provides insight into Ellington's innovative approach to sound, citing his use of voice as a \"jazz instrument\" in Creole Love Call, an early example of his ability to incorporate vocal texture without the constraints of lyrics. This slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece exemplifies Ellington's skill in complementing the style of his soloists, a characteristic that defines his career. The piece unfolds over six choruses, each with its own distinct character:\n\nChorus 1: A call-and-response exchange between voice and reeds, where the voice begins with a smooth, melodic tone, gradually shifting to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that expands on the basic melody, emphasizing several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus, with a call-and-response exchange between the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus, as the reeds initiate the call-and-response, backed by syncopated stop-time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the first chorus's structure, with call-and-response between voice and reeds. In this final chorus, the voice adopts the growl technique, soloing like an instrument.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is but one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington masterfully combines his expertise in orchestration with his ear for tone color. The call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing is a prime example of Ellington's ability to create a rich, complementary sound by blending vocal and instrumental elements. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) further explores these ideas, as Ellington skillfully utilizes Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone to introduce the melody.",
            "It was a nagging void that had plagued her since adolescence - a sense of yearning that she couldn't quite quench. It started when she was 14, right in the midst of navigating the ups and downs of being a teenager. Three years later, at 17, the feeling still lingered, but now she was convinced it was a desire for connection with someone, not just a thing. Yet, despite the attention from a few boys, none of them had truly piqued her interest. She often found herself lost in self-reflection, searching for answers to this enigma. Theories had surfaced over the years, but nothing had ever felt quite right. Life went on, with her constantly questioning her desires, searching for a resolution.\n\nHer home life was typically a serene sanctuary. Her parents were calm and peaceful individuals who rarely argued with each other. Oddly enough, they were even less likely to argue with their daughter, who was always trying to assert her independence and vibrant personality. This dynamic created an interesting contrast between her parents' tranquility and her lively, outgoing nature, making her even more endearing to those around her.\n\nBut this particular day was different. As she wandered from room to room, seeking inspiration, she was jolted by a blood-curdling scream from the kitchen. Her mother's melodious voice pierced the air, followed by her frantic words. She rushed into the kitchen, panic setting in as she frantically asked, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" Her mother lay on the ground, writhing in pain, repeatedly muttering \"Ow\" in short gasps. Her daughter rushed to her side, placing a hand on her to offer support. \"Ouch... sweetie, I... need you to take me to... the hospital.\" The words tumbled out in a rush, and her daughter could sense the gravity of her mother's pain. \"Okay, Mom, just show me where to pick you up.\" Her mother pointed, and in that moment, her daughter was grateful for her fitness classes, which had prepared her to take on this unexpected role. She gently lifted her mother and drove her to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital's sterile atmosphere, heavy with the scent of disinfectant and illness, was a daunting place. But her daughter's focus was solely on helping her mother. She swiftly carried her in and called for the doctors, who quickly arrived to assess the situation. A few worried faces gathered around as they rushed her mother onto a rolling bed. The medical team whisked her away, leaving her daughter to sit anxiously, her mind racing with concern.\n\nIt turned out her mother had taken a tumble off a stool while trying to retrieve a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the benefits of adhering to the Mediterranean Diet (Med diet), as measured by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" in reducing the risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke mortality. The aMed diet is a variation of the Med diet that emphasizes higher consumption of plant foods, including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, while limiting saturated fats and animal products, with moderate alcohol intake allowed.\n\nPrevious studies have shown a connection between adherence to the Med diet and a lower risk of total and cardiovascular mortality, and an intervention trial found the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and improving cholesterol ratios in obese individuals. However, these studies did not specifically examine the relationship between the Med diet and stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study, which followed 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, free of heart disease or diabetes, utilized data from the Nurses' Health Study, a comprehensive cohort study of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Over six intervals between 1984 and 2004, researchers calculated an aMed diet score based on self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs), which assessed nutrient intake over a one-year period. Remarkably, over 95% of participants continued their participation throughout the 20-year study.\n\nTo validate the accuracy of FFQs, each report of heart disease, fatal heart disease, and stroke was cross-checked against medical records, hospital records, autopsy reports, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, \"probable\" cases were included, accounting for approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts.\n\nTo mitigate the impact of individual fluctuations and better represent long-term dietary habits, cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging scores from two preceding years). The researchers also controlled for potential confounding factors, such as age, smoking status, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing Cox proportional-hazard modeling, the study found that a higher aMed diet score was associated with a reduced risk of heart disease and stroke in women. Over the course of 20 years, a total of 2,391 incident CHD cases, 1,763 incident strokes, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were documented. Women in the top aMed quintile exhibited a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "We're still reeling from the economic earthquake that shook the United States to its core in 2007. Unemployment skyrocketed, the housing market imploded, and some of America's top corporations crumbled to the ground. And here we are, still grappling with the wreckage – so it's only natural to wonder: how did this catastrophe unfold, and can we prevent it from happening again? In a nutshell, the financial crisis was triggered by shortsighted and reckless government policies that pushed banks and financial institutions to hand out subprime loans to those who couldn't afford them, against the backdrop of a fragile and underprepared financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) got saddled with underwriting and repackaging these dodgy mortgages into CDOs and CDSs, which had disastrous consequences when borrowers defaulted on their payments.\n\nThe roots of the financial crisis stretch back to 1999, when President Clinton was on a mission to secure a second term. He sought to boost his popularity by easing lending regulations, setting the stage for the subprime crisis that would unfold seven years later. As Steven Holmes of the New York Times astutely observed in 1999, Fannie Mae – the country's largest underwriter of home mortgages – was feeling the heat from the Clinton administration to make more loans to low- and moderate-income borrowers, while also being pressed by shareholders to maintain its impressive profit growth. Holmes prophetically warned of the potential consequences: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may struggle in an economic downturn, prompting a government bailout similar to the one for the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As we now know, poorly advised lending would lead to an economic meltdown.\n\nA perfect storm of factors contributed to the economic freefall, including the proliferation of innovative but complicated mortgage products like adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These complex financial instruments entwined the housing market with other sectors of the economy, leaving U.S. households and financial markets perilously exposed to even slight changes in housing prices. And then, as if on cue, the housing bubble burst, leaving financial institutions that had invested in mortgage-backed securities reeling. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007 – a staggering 30% of the country's GDP. In the aftermath, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at fire-sale prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to convert to commercial banks subject to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie, meanwhile, were left with a whopping $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were taken under government control in September 2008.",
            "The thrill of exposition - that moment when writers stretch their wings and soar, leaving readers in awe of their prose.  Or, more often, the part where readers' eyelids droop and they hastily click the \"Back\" button, muttering a curse under their breath.  Dr. Merlin has been known to pound her keyboard in frustration when she finds herself stuck in a quagmire of unnecessary details, and it's not the fun kind of frustration.\n\nExposition is not a friend to writers.\n\nEven seasoned writers like Dr. Merlin still fall prey to long, meandering passages that leave nothing but a sense of tedium in their wake.  We know the essential writing tip: \"Show, don't tell,\" but it's a hard habit to break.  Exposition is that pesky voice in our heads that whispers, \"Get the backstory over with so we can get to the good stuff\" (not to be confused with the voice that urges us to reveal every intimate detail of our characters' pasts).\n\nSo, what is exposition? It's the act of telling the reader what's happened, usually in straightforward language.  In film, it's the scene where one character dumps a load of information on another (think \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\").  In fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nLet's take a look at an example.  Imagine a story where the heroine meets her beloved, gets married in a grand ceremony, and her husband is brutally murdered before her eyes.  You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to unfold over two pages, with both characters only uttering a few words.  You'd want to see more of the husband's character come alive through his words and actions, and the heroine's transformation as she falls in love with him.  You'd want to feel the depth of their bond, the impact his presence has on her life, and the clues that hint at her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams.  By doing this, you'd become invested in his fate and hers, and mourn his loss alongside her.  That's what makes a story come alive - the meat on the bone of the plot: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs writers, we need to provide that meat.  Sometimes it's tempting to rush past certain details, but the payoff is worth the extra effort.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and know he used to be in the Air Force, now works the night shift at a gas station, has been married twice, has no kids, and dreams of owning the gas station someday.  Don't just give the reader a laundry list of facts - show us through his actions, dialogue, and expressions why these details matter.  Give your readers a reason to care about this character and the world you're creating.",
            "I tuned in to the local news from Columbus, Ohio, and witnessed two newscasts, one on August 13, 2011. The first one, NBC 4's live broadcast in the morning, caught my attention with a particularly disturbing story. A man named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio, had allegedly stabbed his wife, though her name was not mentioned. His mug shot was displayed, and he looked every inch the embodiment of malevolence. Not surprisingly, this developing story received only two minutes of airtime. I think they devoted an adequate amount of time to the story, considering its gravity.\n\nThe second story told the heart-wrenching tale of an 18-year-old named Travis Buyers, who was shot in the Sharon Woods area. He was left critically injured, and at the time, no arrests had been made or suspects identified. The SWAT Team was hot on the case. I couldn't help but feel that this story received short shrift, and I suspect the reason might be rooted in the fact that the victim was a young black man from a predominantly black neighborhood. I've observed this phenomenon before – minorities are often overlooked when they're victims of crime. In contrast, when a white child or adult falls victim, the media sensationalizes the story, whereas a minority victim is lucky to receive minimal coverage. \n\nSubsequent stories included an investigation into a gunshot hole found on a Med-Flight helicopter. Details were provided about the possible location of the incident, and it was determined that a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle was responsible. Crime-Stoppers offered a substantial reward, $5,000, for any information leading to the arrest of the perpetrator.\n\nThe forecast for the weekend mentioned rain and thunderstorms on Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to hover in the mid-to-low eighties. The segment was brief, but I suspect the anchor wanted to use it as a teaser to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nAnother story highlighted the robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The perpetrator, described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt, was allegedly around six feet tall and weighed around 150 pounds. I found it striking that they devoted an inordinate amount of time to emphasizing the robber's skin tone and the darkness of his complexion.\n\nLastly, a story reported on Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas-based marijuana kingpin who had been sentenced to 300 months in prison for conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana to Ohio from Texas. I couldn't help but notice that they chose to mention his Hispanic heritage, which seemed irrelevant to the story. It left me wondering if they thought it added a layer of gravity to the narrative or if it was simply a gratuitous detail.",
            "There's an unbreakable bond between brothers, a connection that runs deeper than words can express. This bond is a complex web of emotions - love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty - all intertwined like the threads of a rich tapestry. Brothers have a unique understanding of each other, one that transcends the boundaries of ordinary relationships. When the chips are down and things get tough, the true nature of this bond is revealed, whether it's beautiful or ugly. The cost of this bond is steep, and it's only when we confront the consequences of our actions that we can truly understand its power. When we look at our brother and see our own reflection staring back, we're forced to confront the truth about ourselves - our flaws, our strengths, and our true character. This is a theme that's expertly woven throughout William Faulkner's \"The Scarlet Ibis\", a haunting tale of two brothers locked in a dance of emotions. Set against the backdrop of a lush, vivid landscape, their journey is a futile yet poignant one, marked by the bitter clash of disappointment and pride. Ultimately, only one brother emerges unscathed, leaving the other to grapple with the devastating consequences of their actions.\n\nAt the heart of this story is the protagonist's all-consuming pride. From the moment he and his little brother, Doodle, set out together, he's driven by a sense of resentment towards the younger boy. He'd envisioned a brother who could share in his adventures, who could keep up with his wild spirit and thirst for excitement. But Doodle's fragile health dashes those hopes, leaving the protagonist feeling frustrated and angry. He's even shown to harbor a dark secret - a desire to eliminate the perceived burden that Doodle represents. Yet, in a subtle yet telling moment, his defenses crumble when he catches Doodle's smile. This fleeting glimpse of joy humanizes the protagonist, revealing a love for his brother that's been there all along. It's a love that's not always easy to acknowledge, but it's a love that ultimately redeems him.\n\nThrough the protagonist's actions and interactions with Doodle, Faulkner masterfully explores the complexities of brotherly love and the consequences that come with it. The narrator's perspective adds another layer of depth to the story, offering a glimpse into the protagonist's inner world and the emotions that drive him. As we follow the brothers on their fateful journey, we're forced to confront the darker aspects of human nature - our own flaws, our own capacity for cruelty and love. In the end, it's a powerful reminder that the bonds we form with others are the greatest teachers of all, and that it's only by confronting our own reflections that we can truly grow and change.",
            "I've often found myself wondering about the intricate workings of the human brain, a complex information-processing system that's as baffling as it is fascinating. Over time, our understanding of the brain has evolved, much like the technology that's revolutionized our lives. We've likened it to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, then a book, and more recently, to a computer. While these metaphors have been helpful in describing the brain's functions, they also have their limitations, often leading us down a path of misconceptions.\n\nThe journey of information processing begins with the sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli like touch, heat, and light into electrical signals. This process is a series of transformations, where the brain's algorithms work their magic, both bottom-up and top-down. For instance, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing assembles basic information like color, orientation, and object borders to determine that you're seeing a box. Meanwhile, top-down processing uses the decisions made earlier to expedite your recognition of the box, perhaps helping you identify it as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole.\n\nAs information is processed to some extent, an attention filter decides its importance and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name in a noisy room. This process of processing and filtering is repeated at multiple stages, with attention modulating the results each time.\n\nFor the brain to process information effectively, it must first store it. There are various types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. Information is initially encoded, with different types of encoding suited to each type of sensory stimulus. For instance, verbal input can be encoded structurally, phonemically, or semantically. Once information is stored, it needs to be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores info for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a specific series of neurons for a short period. Long-term memory, on the other hand, is thought to be maintained in the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are numerous models of how knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on human subjects' memory retrieval, others inspired by computer science, and others rooted in neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented by nodes, connected based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In his seminal novel Brave New World, Aldous Huxley issues a dire warning about the dangers of unchecked technological advancement and the capitalist systems that fuel it. His dystopian vision paints a picture of a future where individuals are conditioned to prioritize short-term happiness above all else, surrendering their autonomy to a rigid community that suppresses individuality. The citizens of this world are mere pawns in a game controlled by the World Controller, forced to conform to a single ideology that permeates every aspect of their lives. A closer examination of the text through the lens of Marxist theory reveals Huxley's scathing critique of the emerging economic systems of his time, with Marxist concepts like homogeny and reification providing a framework for understanding the novel's underlying themes.\n\nHuxley's satirical take on capitalism is particularly noteworthy, as he employs the Marxist concept of false consciousness to highlight the ways in which the common citizenry is kept in the dark about the true nature of their relationships with other economic classes. The people are conditioned through hypnopædia to crave consumption, indulgence, and self-gratification, effectively rendering them pawns in a game controlled by the ruling elite. The lower classes, exemplified by the Delta and Gamma castes, are oblivious to the manipulation, while the upper classes, represented by the Alphas and Betas, are complicit in their own oppression, refusing to challenge the status quo.\n\nThe relationships between individuals in Brave New World are shallow and lacking in depth, suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism is eroding humanity's capacity for genuine emotional expression and free will. Love, in particular, is absent from this world, replaced by superficial interactions that prioritize physical appearance over substance. The societal classes' complacency with their assigned roles in the hierarchy serves as a testament to the insidious effects of capitalist ideology, where individuals are conditioned to believe they are superior to others as long as they conform and consume.\n\nHuxley's work offers a searing indictment of the dehumanizing effects of capitalist systems, where individuals are reduced to mere automatons, devoid of autonomy and agency. By exploring the intersections of technology, capitalism, and human relationships, Huxley challenges readers to consider the consequences of creating a world where individuality and free will are sacrificed for the sake of efficiency and conformity.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for nearly three years now, or roughly five semesters. For many, including myself, navigating this campus can be a real challenge. My first year, I was stuck in an East Halls dorm room, essentially the easternmost outpost of campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Commuting from my Stuart Hall digs to classes in places like the Willard building, which is actually closer to the center of campus, would take around 25 minutes on foot, especially when the weather's less than ideal, which is often the case in State College. I had a conversation with an alum not much older than me, and it turns out that not so long ago, the East Halls dorms were isolated from the rest of the school by huge swaths of empty land. Today, that vacant space has been transformed into sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and the health services building, and swanky new apartments. As the campus continues to expand, getting around becomes increasingly complicated. So, what's the solution to this mobility conundrum? On a college campus, I firmly believe that the bicycle is the answer. However, a bike alone won't solve the problem; students need to ride them, and the campus architecture needs to accommodate the needs of bicyclists.\n\nI recently spoke with a friend who's recently taken up bicycling again after a hiatus, and he confessed that he wondered why he stopped in the first place. \"Bikes are great,\" he said, \"for a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Not only is bicycling good for your physical health, it's also the most efficient mode of transportation. A bowl of oatmeal and a bit of physical exertion can take you 30 miles or more. Like many of my fellow undergrads, I currently live off campus, just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. I made the smartest decision of the year when I bought a bike. I have class every day in Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my place. With a bike, I can cut that time down to just 5 minutes if I pedal hard enough. The only catch is that Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas building from my house, isn't always the most bike-friendly road. There are pros to walking, of course, but personally, I'm too busy to walk. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option, and it would take around 30-40 minutes each way, adding up to over two and a half hours every week. Factor in all the other time I'd spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and the like, and that's more time than I can spare."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.

Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",

To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "While pursuing my education in social work, I've found myself drawn to a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services, where I hope to make a difference in the lives of children who've been victimized or neglected, as well as offer support to families in crisis. As I delve deeper into this field, I've come to realize that the values I bring to the table – service, respect, and an unwavering commitment to ethics – are not only essential to the social work profession, but also deeply personal to me. I've always been driven to help others, though I've struggled to pinpoint the perfect career path. Throughout high school and college, I watched as people dodged their problems or employed coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. As I navigated this uncertainty, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, but even that didn't provide the clarity I was seeking.\n\nA pivotal moment arrived when I spent the summer after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. I visited a friend, and she introduced me to a 16-year-old boy who was anxious and skittish on her couch. She explained that he had come to escape his abusive parents, and the next day, I learned he'd called the police to their residence. Feeling compelled to act, I drove to his parents' house, where I discreetly discussed my concerns with the authorities and revealed my recent psychology degree. The police asked me to speak with the parents since there was little they could do for the teenager. As I questioned them, they seemed evasive and made excuses for their son's behavior, labeling it as \"manipulative\" and a \"simple dispute.\" This experience jarred me into seriously considering a career in social work, particularly in helping children navigate family conflicts.\n\nSocial justice is another fundamental value that resonates deeply within me. As a society, we tout individuality, yet often prioritize conformity. We mourn those we've lost, yet strive to be like everyone else. I'm an individual, and I refuse to conform to societal expectations. Throughout high school and college, I consistently spoke out against social injustice – through bold fashion choices, declarations of support for the GSBA, and fighting against racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it. I believe in the power of social justice and will continue to challenge the status quo.",
            "The relationship between insomnia and its underlying causes is a multifaceted issue that can be approached through two distinct models: the biological and sociocultural models. While the biological model delves into the genetic and physiological aspects of sleep disorders, the sociocultural model examines the environmental factors that influence an individual's sleep patterns. In this review, we will delve into the intricacies of insomnia, exploring the various categories of sleep disorders and how they relate to these two models. We will also critique the research that supports each model, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nInsomnia can manifest in different forms, including primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders linked to mental health issues, and sleep disorders caused by medical complications or substance use. Within the primary sleep disorders category, we find the Dyssomnias, which encompass a range of conditions, including Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia is characterized by difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is marked by excessive daytime sleepiness. Narcolepsy, on the other hand, is associated with cataplexy and automatic REM sleep.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders focuses on the genetic and physiological factors that influence sleep patterns. Research has shown that the hypothalamus, a region in the brain, plays a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for this regulation, and studies have discovered that the activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while its inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and increased sleep time. For instance, a study involving mice found that the activation of the GABAB receptors on orexin neurons can induce sleep, and the use of the GABAB agonist, baclofen, increased sleep time. These findings suggest that there is a genetic basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans, and alterations in this receptor can impact an individual's ability to sleep without medication.\n\nThe sociocultural implications of this research are significant, as they suggest that inherited genetic traits can influence an individual's sleep patterns. If an individual inherits a phenotype that affects the GABAB receptor, it could naturally disrupt their sleep, leading to problems in various aspects of life, such as school, career, and daily tasks that require focus. This highlights the importance of considering both biological and sociocultural factors when understanding and addressing insomnia.",
            "I'm still trying to wrap my head around Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It's a condition that affects how the central nervous system processes what we hear. Simply put, it's not that people with CAPD can't hear, but their brains have trouble making sense of the sounds they pick up. It's like having a radio that receives the signal, but the dial is stuck on static – the brain's ability to distinguish words, conversations, and background noise is all over the place.\n\nCAPD has been around since the 1950s, when researchers first identified it as \"auditory imperception.\" The Italian team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari developed the first tests for kids with communication disorders back in 1954. Fast forward to the 1970s, and a national conference sparked a wave of research into CAPD.\n\nSo, what does CAPD look like in action? Some people might struggle to pinpoint where sounds are coming from, while others might have trouble telling two sounds apart. They might not be able to recognize patterns or differentiate between changes in speech, like when someone's voice changes tone to indicate sarcasm. Imagine trying to decipher a code without the decoder ring – it's like that. And if one sound gets drowned out by another, it's like trying to hear a whisper in a busy restaurant.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, professionals like audiologists and speech-language pathologists use a combination of observation and testing. They might give patients questionnaires, observe their reactions to different stimuli, or even record the electrical signals in the ear to see how the brain responds. It's a complex process, and there's no single test that stands out as a clear winner. The unknown cause of CAPD only adds to the mystery.\n\nAs a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom, it's essential to be aware of the red flags that might indicate a student has CAPD. By being attuned to these cues, you can provide extra support and create a more inclusive learning environment. It's all about being sensitive to the ways CAPD can affect a student's ability to learn and succeed.",
            "It seems that Shakespeare's Twelfth Night conveys the idea that while disguising oneself can facilitate deception on a grand scale, ultimately, embracing one's true self is essential to avoid losing oneself in the process. One of the challenges in shedding a disguise, however, lies in the risk of alienating those around us. In some cases, people may react with indifference to being deceived, while others, understandably, might take offense to the charade. This raises the question of prioritizing one's own identity versus preserving relationships with others. \n\nGender role reversal, in particular, adds a layer of complexity, as it prompts us to ponder the motivations behind such a disguise. Take Viola, for instance, who dons a masculine guise to safeguard herself in a foreign land. Her ruse works, but it also isolates her from her female support system and, as it turns out, even causes her to be mistaken for Sebastian, leading Olivia to fall for her. Viola also grapples with suppressed feelings for Orsino, whose words suggest a hidden attraction to her. \n\nIn a way, Twelfth Night can be seen as a commentary on how deception can unveil repressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. The play hints that these characters might be harboring unconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to confront. The ease with which Olivia moves from infatuation with Cesario to a familial bond with Viola suggests that Olivia is more likely parodying the shallow judgments of her contemporaries, who often rely on surface-level appearances.",
            "I've witnessed firsthand the brutal legacy of German colonial rule, especially in its brutal treatment of the Ovaherero and Nama in what is now Namibia. However, no single phrase can encapsulate the complexities of a sprawling colonial empire. Just as the terrain varied, so did the policies and ruling styles of the German colonial empire. Educational provisions across the colonies were as diverse as the lands they occupied. When the British took over Tanganyika, they found a population of educated and literate Africans, a stark contrast to the situation in other colonies.\n\nIn South West Africa, however, the government abdicated its responsibility for native education, leaving most of it to underfunded missionary societies. Meanwhile, they lavished resources on European education, establishing state schools and tightly regulating missionary institutions. This disjointed approach had far-reaching consequences for the region, even long after German rule. While other colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, South West Africa remained largely untouched, uneducated, and illiterate. What drove this divergent experience? This essay seeks to shed more light on this issue by examining the complex interplay of social, political, and economic factors.\n\nThe existing literature on German colonial education is vast and mostly written in German, with many works dating back to the early twentieth century. These early studies mostly focused on describing the educational systems in place. Later studies, written in English, delved deeper, comparing education systems across colonies and analyzing specific aspects in greater detail. Notably, Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa laid the groundwork for this discussion. By comparing the two colonies, Cohen identified the significant differences in their educational systems, attributing many of them to the large settler population in South West Africa.\n\nSouth West Africa's climate was relatively mild, albeit with vast expanses of arid desert. This relatively hospitable environment attracted a sizeable settler population. By 1913, nearly 15,000 Europeans called South West Africa home, far outpacing the 5,336 settlers in East Africa, the next largest colony.",
            "Fast forward a century, and the landscape of popular music has undergone a seismic shift, with genres mushrooming like weeds in a fertile field. It's a daunting task to pin down every single one of them, and the situation is further complicated by the fact that most popular genres – think rap, rock, country, jazz, folk – have given birth to their own mini-genres within their domain. But if there's one genre that's taken the cake for diversity and expressiveness, it's Heavy Metal, which has evolved over the past four decades into a behemoth of a genre that's as dark as it is bold.\n\nThe beauty of Heavy Metal lies in its chameleon-like ability to adapt and transform, giving birth to an endless array of sub-genres and sub-sub-genres that continue to sprout and grow. Today, with the genre having become a vast, sprawling entity, it's tricky to pinpoint exactly what constitutes Heavy Metal. This is because it's incorporated elements from other genres, yet its roots are firmly planted in a particular tradition. To truly understand the Heavy Metal phenomenon, we need to delve into its core, exploring what makes it a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nAt its heart, Metal is a genre defined by its affinity for the darker side of life. It's music that's loud, raw, and unapologetic, often incorporating elements of the dramatic and the theatrical. Bands that make Metal music are known for their technical prowess, with musicianship that's polished and refined. And let's be honest – Metal has long had a reputation for being a genre that's heavily influenced by substances that alter the mind. The psychedelic boom of the 1970s led to a proliferation of records that were truly out of this world, with musicians using their experiences under the influence as a creative wellspring.\n\nMetal's visceral qualities are a major part of its appeal, offering a sonic landscape that's often bleak and unflinching. This was a radical departure from the more upbeat, feel-good music that dominated the airwaves in the past. Later generations of Metal musicians drew inspiration from the Romantic Era's emphasis on the darker, more intense aspects of human experience. Lyrics like those found in Helter Skelter, often cited as one of the first Heavy Metal songs, perfectly capture the genre's affinity for the shadows. This Beatles' classic, with its moods that swing wildly between euphoria and despair, showcases the darker side of human emotion, a staple of the Metal movement.",
            "I still get a kick out of thinking about the early days of Surrealism, when artists like those associated with the movement started crafting their dreamlike masterpieces. But there was one artist who was actually painting his dreams – literally and figuratively – years before the Surrealists came on the scene. I'm talking about Henri Rousseau, a Post-Impressionist master who created The Dream in 1910, a painting that not only showcases a woman in awe of the wonders of a dreamland but also reveals Rousseau's own aspirations and struggles as an artist.\n\nRousseau's dream was to be recognized, accepted, and praised by his peers and the art world. But he found himself torn between conforming to the styles of the time to gain acceptance and staying true to his unique vision. This internal conflict is the very essence of The Dream, a work that reflects Rousseau's lifelong struggle to balance his desire for artistic individuality with the pressure to conform to the expectations of the art world.\n\nTo truly understand the significance of The Dream, you need to know a bit about Rousseau's backstory. Born on May 21, 1844, in the French town of Laval, Rousseau grew up in a relatively affluent family – his father was a prosperous tinsmith and hardware dealer. However, he didn't receive any formal art training, and instead, worked as a municipal toll collector until he was forty. But art was his true passion, and after his first wife's untimely death, which was followed by the loss of eight infant children, he turned to painting as a way to cope with his grief and find a new sense of purpose.\n\nUnlike many of his contemporaries, who romanticized and sentimentalized the peasant class in their art, Rousseau was a folk painter who created works that reflected the hopes and dreams of the average working-class person. Given his late start in life and the fact that he was producing art alongside more established artists, it's no wonder that Rousseau felt pressure to be accepted by the art world. He didn't gain widespread recognition until around the same time that Matisse was starting to make a name for himself. As art historian Jan Gordon noted, while Matisse was driven by a desire to avoid painting in a mundane way, Rousseau's goal was to create conventionally beautiful works that would earn him a spot in the prestigious Artiste Français.",
            "Throughout history, great thinkers have been insistent on the deep connection between ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. I believe there's a profound reason behind this. As John Keats so eloquently put it in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty— That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Our understanding of the world is largely shaped by education and experience, yet we somehow instinctively grasp the value of ethics and aesthetics, as Keats suggests. Both ethics and aesthetics are about describing, not prescribing. Our studies of morality and beauty are essentially attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than providing a set of rigid rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nTo put it more directly, criticism of art or morals can never fully capture the essence of what's good or beautiful. Discussions about the worth of the Mona Lisa, for example, might revolve around concepts like composition, contrast, or cultural context, but ultimately, these don't explain why it's good art. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often respond with a phrase like, \"There's just something about it,\" followed by a more intricate or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be reduced to a simple description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor astutely observed, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we describe the properties of a work of literature, there's always something left unspoken. Similarly, I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein noted, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I propose that it's this \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, which makes art and morality so powerful, and that their transcendental nature provides a common ground between them.\n\nI believe that morality and art are closely linked because we experience both most intensely at a fundamental, noumenal level, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be felt, but not fully explained. This connection is even stronger when it comes to literature. As McKean points out, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany's unity is what makes it a force to be reckoned with today. From the shadows of the Alps in München to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel, the country boasts a unique culture that's a blend of its diverse heritage. This cultural fusion can be felt throughout, from the Rhine River city of Köln to the heart of Germany, all the way to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. Given its rich history, it's no surprise that modern Germany is a melting pot of various cultures and tribes.\n\nThe birthplace of the Germans is known as Germania, but its origins are shrouded in mystery. Historians and scholars are still debating the name's roots. Tacitus believed it stemmed from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were previously known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and clashed with the Gauls. Julius Caesar, on the other hand, used the term \"Germanus\" in his account of the Gallic Wars, where he battled the Gauls and Germanic tribes that often crossed the Rhine with a mischievous agenda. Caesar coined this term from the Gauls themselves, using it to differentiate between the conquered Gauls and the unconquered Germanic tribes. In his first book, Caesar notes, \"The Germans, who live beyond the Rhine, continually wage war with the Gauls.\" Some theorize that the name \"German\" comes from the Gaulish language, while others propose it derived from the spear used in warfare, known as a ger. Another theory suggests it originated from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" possibly indicating the Germans were loud and boisterous.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus, in his 98 AD writing \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" provides insight into the origins of the Germans, describing them as aboriginal and unadulterated by other cultures. He writes, \"Who would leave Asia or Africa for Italy, for Germany with its harsh climate, unforgiving skies, and rough demeanor, unless it were their homeland?\" The Romans, at least initially, showed little interest in settling in Germany, preferring to conquer and trade with the Germanic tribes instead. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they lived on the fringes of the Roman Empire, exchanging goods and skills with the Romans, who valued their military prowess and services within the Roman army.",
            "I stood blankly in front of the toilet, my mind a complete blank slate. Thoughts ping-ponged through my brain, but nothing stuck. It was as if I'd become a vessel for the visual landscape before me, a mere observer detached from my own thoughts. My consciousness whirled through the scene like water, effortlessly flowing from one moment to the next. The image of the offending brown package in the toilet bowl stared me down, but I didn't feel a thing. It was almost as if I'd disconnected from my own emotions, observing the world with a practiced lack of attachment.\n\nI used to be fascinated by art, ever since I was a kid. As an adult, I finally bought a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" – advice from a friend and fellow artist. It promised to teach me the ropes, from the basics of understanding what a pencil is to the intricate processes our brains use to decipher lines. One technique caught my eye: framing a picture within a square. It's supposed to break down a complex scene into something manageable, transforming a messy bowl of fruit on a cluttered kitchen table into a simple, contained image. But at that moment, gazing at the toilet, I couldn't fathom the concept. I was overwhelmed, awestruck, and could only stand there, frozen in wonder.\n\nArtistic influences swirled through my mind – Picasso's blue period, Monet's love of greenery, the Renaissance masters' kaleidoscope of colors. If I dared to imagine myself as an artist, this was my chance to start something new, something worthy of the title. I had titled it \"Work in Brown\" in my mind. I reached for my trusty pencil, my hand flexing as I prepared to bring my vision to life. My muscles tensed, relaxed, and tensed again, as if ready to dance.\n\nBut instead, my hand smacked the toilet handle once, twice, with a growing sense of frustration. The offending package refused to budge, stuck like a stubborn slug on the bottom of the toilet. I stood, a mop in hand, my tie feeling constricting around my neck. A few more flushes, a few more moments to collect myself, and I reached for the toilet paper roll, wrapping my hand in a makeshift mitten. I stooped, dipping into the toilet bowl like a mother preparing the Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "The alarming statistics about teenagers behind the wheel are a sobering reminder of the perils of driving at a tender age. Several factors contribute to this grim reality, and the National Institutes of Health shed light on the brain's unreadiness for the dangers of driving as one crucial element. The lack of experience is another significant factor, leading to a higher frequency of fatal accidents, rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road. \n\nTeenagers, in particular, are more accident-prone when accompanied by their peers, which, as we all know, happens frequently. A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center revealed a telling correlation between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\nIn an effort to curb this trend, some states, including California, have implemented provisional driver's licenses that restrict the hours and passengers for teen drivers. However, I believe these measures are merely a temporary fix. The core issue lies in the fact that, statistically speaking, the youngest drivers are not equipped to handle the risks and responsibilities associated with driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman's research suggests that 18 is still too early for a full driver's license, as those under 19-20 tend to be thrill-seekers. Delaying driving licenses until this impulse subsides could save countless lives. Continuing to issue licenses to young teens will only lead to more tragic accidents and a staggering death toll in the coming years, particularly when millions of new teen drivers hit the road by 2010, the year the Baby Boomers' children become eligible.\n\nImplementing legislation to address this issue would be a relatively straightforward process. Schools could continue to offer driver's education classes to lay the groundwork for future drivers, but no one under 18 should be allowed to operate a vehicle. A provisional permit could still be issued before granting a full license, and a set number of practical training hours could be required. This number could be based on the existing standards of most states, such as California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult. Uniform national legislation would be a reasonable and effective way to protect teenagers across the country. This idea is not a new one, but it's a sound solution to a pressing problem.",
            "I decided to dive into the Library of Congress's treasure trove of early Edison films, specifically the trick films from 1895 to 1901. There are 15 of them in total, and I found myself captivated by their creative use of editing to conjure illusions. My exploration of these films focused on analyzing the poetic elements that make them tick and identifying the progressive characteristics that set some of the later films apart. At the turn of the century, trick films were largely static, confined to a single, frontal proscenium, and adhered to a strict one-shot-per-film rule, with a focus on long and medium shots. However, a few early 20th-century films dared to break free from these conventions by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nOne thing that stood out to me was the common thread of filming within an interior set, framed within a frontal proscenium. The camera remained stationary, refusing to follow figures or objects as they moved. This composition drew its roots from the theatre and, for trick films, the world of vaudeville and magic shows. A limitation of this setup was that figures in trick films were generally confined to side-to-side movement, unable to approach or recede from the camera. Take, for instance, the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where the actors enter from the right and move back and forth along the horizontal axis, disappearing from view without the camera following them.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style also led to a reliance on long shots, with medium shots appearing less frequently. Close-ups were nonexistent in these early trick films, a nod to the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would witness the entire performance from a fixed vantage point. As in many early films, actors rarely moved towards the camera, making close-ups a rarity. Most trick films from the Edison catalog stuck to the rule of one conceptual shot per film, keeping their length brief – typically under a minute, depending on the frames per second used. This constraint limited the dramatic and narrative potential of these films, which often focused on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearances, and switching acts with minimal storytelling. However, a closer examination of these films revealed that what appears to be one physical shot can, in fact, be several joined together to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance, as seen in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), where a more detailed inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the entire film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "Meet John Taylor of Caroline, a true pioneer in the realm of Republicanism. As a passionate advocate for individual liberties and limited government, his unwavering dedication to these causes was forged in the fires of his agricultural pursuits and brief foray into politics. While his work as a farmer formed the foundation of his views on governance, it was his conviction in the superiority of agrarian life that colored his opinions on sovereignty, constitutionalism, and the judiciary.\n\nTaylor believed that the United States possessed a unique opportunity to craft an ideal system of government, untainted by the influence of native traditions. This blank slate allowed him to envision a system of self-governance that would safeguard the inherent rights of individuals, which he believed were interdependent and indivisible. If one right was compromised, the value of all others would suffer. Consequently, these rights should be beyond the reach of government meddling. In his view, the so-called \"state of nature\" was a chaotic realm where the strong preyed on the weak, but he believed that civilization should not perpetuate this paradigm.\n\nTo create an ideal society, Taylor posited that a government must be established that acknowledges the duality of human nature – its propensity for both good and evil. He was resolute in his adherence to a dualistic morality, arguing that government, being an extension of humanity, would reflect both its virtues and vices. Taylor defined good principles as those that protected private property, promoted agriculture, and discouraged excessive capitalism. He contended that a government grounded in these principles would function impartially, despite the inevitable presence of self-interest and avarice in its administration. However, he believed that self-interest was only malevolent when it led to the proliferation of sub-societies that exploited others at the expense of the greater good. A benevolent government was necessary to contain humanity's darker tendencies, and it must be vigilantly monitored to prevent the introduction of pernicious principles.\n\nLike many stalwart Republicans of his time, Taylor championed a strict construction of the Constitution, advocating for a minimalist federal government with only the powers explicitly granted to it. He recognized that an expansive federal government was prone to despotism due to its associated costs. However, Taylor cautioned against a literal interpretation of the Constitution, warning that it could lead to corruption without consideration for the intent of its authors. Moreover, he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it more explicitly described the country as a federation of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Looking back at the data in Figure 17, we noticed a significant drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. This was a bit of a letdown, and it's tough to pinpoint the reason behind it. One possibility is that the onset of winter on our New England campus led people to abandon their bikes and foot-powered commutes, which could account for part of the decline. The end of the fall semester in December might also have played a role, as students and faculty were preoccupied with finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and the like, making it easy to overlook the commuter log. The start of the holiday season in December, followed by a month-long break for students and faculty, likely contributed to the low number of submissions. Things picked up again when classes resumed in late January, but the low numbers persisted through February. It's possible that the initial enthusiasm for the project wore off, leading to a natural decline in engagement. To counter this trend, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a special blitz campaign to revitalize the initiative, which succeeded in boosting log submissions for that month. However, this still left us grappling with the challenge of maintaining momentum despite the inevitable decrease in engagement due to holiday and semester breaks. Another hurdle for our project, and for any alternative commuting initiative, is the deep-seated cultural attachment to driving one's own vehicle. To overcome this, it's essential to offer incentives that appeal to people's love of freedom, independence, and flexibility on the road. We rewarded participants with gift cards to local eateries, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local bookstore, and even larger chain stores. It would have been interesting to see how bigger prizes might have impacted participation – perhaps a shiny new bike, a hybrid car, or an electric vehicle. This could have helped mitigate the dip in engagement we experienced. The prizes remained the same throughout the project, but if we had announced additional incentives over time, like a bike in December and a car in January, engagement might have increased instead of decreased.",
            "Imagine a financial product that's a hybrid of an index fund and a stock, offering the benefits of diversification and flexibility. That's what an exchange-traded fund, or ETF, is all about. Unlike a traditional mutual fund, an ETF allows you to buy and sell it on an exchange, much like a stock, but with the added advantage of tracking an index or a basket of assets. The allure of ETFs lies in their ability to provide diversification, the benefits of single stock ownership, and the flexibility to sell short, buy on margin, or purchase a single share in any transaction. But don't let that fool you - the expense ratios of ETFs are often lower than those of the average mutual fund. However, there's a catch: you'll need to pay a commission on every trade, just like you would with a stock order.\n\nThe real beauty of ETFs lies in their vast array of options, with various funds catering to different investment needs. But, it's crucial to keep in mind that even with these benefits, it's essential to scrutinize the actual performance of the ETF and its components. In this case, we're taking a closer look at the ETF IHF and its top 10 holdings, which account for a significant 63.58% of its assets. By examining these top holdings, we'll determine whether owning a single ETF can provide similar benefits to diversifying your portfolio with the same stocks.\n\nTo keep things concise, we'll focus on the top 10 holdings, representing the bulk of the ETF's assets. We'll use this subset to estimate how well the ETF's 10 stocks represent the entire fund. By calculating the Beta and return of a portfolio comprising only these 10 stocks, in the same proportions as the ETF's holdings, we can gauge their performance. The results are telling: a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings shows a 6.11% higher return, a whopping 16% increase, compared to the ETF. Moreover, the Beta of this portfolio is a full 0.12 lower than the ETF's, suggesting a potentially more stable investment.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that these findings might not be statistically significant. To confirm, we'll examine the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100%, and compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "I have always been fascinated by Edgar Allan Poe's magnum opus, \"Dream-Land.\" This enchanting poem is, in Poe's own words, one of his best works. One of the most intriguing aspects of \"Dream-Land\" is Poe's repeated use of the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56. According to the esteemed scholar Mabbott, this enigmatic reference can be traced back to the great Roman poet Virgil. Virgil, in his turn, borrowed the term from an ancient Greek concept, describing Thulé as an island situated at the edge of the known world, situated north of Britain.\n\nHowever, there's more to the story than meets the eye. Poe's fondness for German literature is well-documented, and it's likely that he drew inspiration from the works of the celebrated German author Goethe. Karl J. Arndt, in his seminal work \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" highlights the striking similarities between their two poems, concluding that Poe was, in fact, influenced by Goethe's writing.\n\nThe connection between Poe and Goethe is further cemented by Goethe's iconic poetic drama, \"Faust,\" which was published in two parts, with the first installment appearing in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe's passing. Within the second part of \"Faust,\" there's a poignant poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This haunting tale revolves around a king whose wife gives him a goblet before her passing, only to see him succumb to excessive drinking and despair. The king's eventual decision to give his possessions to his children and throw the goblet into the ocean, symbolizing his desire to join his beloved wife in death, bears an eerie resemblance to the demeanor of the speaker in \"Dream-Land.\" It's almost as if Poe's work is a dark mirror reflection of Goethe's, echoing his own struggles with loss and addiction.\n\nPoe's use of the term \"Thulé\" is more than just a coincidence, as he references it twice in his collected writings, including \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and \"Dream-Land.\" In fact, the two poems can be seen as companion pieces, with \"The King of Thulé\" serving as a haunting precursor to the desolate landscape of \"Dream-Land.\" The speaker's description of Thulé as a dark, lonely, and colorless world, haunted by the ghosts of departed friends, bears an uncanny resemblance to the king's own emotional state after the loss of his wife. This shared atmosphere of despair and longing suggests a deep connection between the two poems.\n\nIt's worth noting that Poe's admiration for Goethe was not limited to his own work. He also spoke highly of the English poet Tennyson, which would have introduced him to Goethe's writing. Moreover, the numerous reproductions of Goethe's work that followed its original publication would have ensured that Poe was well-versed in his literary legacy.",
            "You might wonder if a customer who slipped on a mess of applesauce at a grocery store and got hurt would be able to get punitive damages from the store manager, who ignored the spill for half an hour because he was too busy eating dinner. The manager had been informed twice about the spill, and even after that, he didn't do anything about it. But will a judge throw out the customer's claim right off the bat? \n\nI'd bet not. To get punitive damages, the customer will have to prove that the store manager acted with a reckless disregard for the harm that would come from leaving the spill there. They'll also have to show that the store manager's actions were despicable - basically, really bad and intentional. The customer has a good shot at this, considering that several other customers had slipped and fallen in the months before and the manager still did nothing to fix the problem. \n\nHere's the background: on October 13th at 5 pm, an employee told the manager, Paul Martin, about the applesauce spill, and he just blew him off, saying he was on his dinner break. Fifteen minutes later, another employee reminded him about the spill, and he gave the same response. Just half an hour later, the customer, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill and hurt her back. It turns out that this wasn't an isolated incident - five other customers had slipped and fallen at the store that same year. Now Palmer is suing the store for both compensation and punitive damages.\n\nIn California, a customer can sue for punitive damages if the store acted with malice - basically, if they intended to hurt the customer or showed a \"despicable\" disregard for the customer's safety. The law defines malice as acting with intent to harm or acting with a reckless disregard for others' safety, even if there's no intent to harm. It's like the court said in a previous case, when the defendant was aware of the potential danger of their actions and still chose to ignore it.",
            "It's been nearly four years since I took a course in Islam at CBC, a journey that sowed the seeds of a long-standing question: is Islam a hostile religion? As I reflect on the past two decades, I'm struck by the pendulum swing in public perception, oscillating wildly between hostility and excessive tolerance. The aftermath of 9/11 marked a turning point, as mass media shifted from a predominantly negative view of Islam to a more accepting stance. I find it astonishing that in 2001, it would have been unimaginable to have a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, whose family ties to Islam are undeniable.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad has long fascinated me, particularly the contradictions between history and the narrative's portrayal of his personality. In my understanding, Muhammad was supposed to be a forceful figure who coerced people into converting to Islam, conquering tribes and imposing his faith upon them. However, the biography presents a different picture – that of a humbled and misunderstood prophet, who humbled himself before others, and his message drew people to him one by one as they discovered the 'truth'. This dichotomy leaves me intrigued and, to a certain extent, perplexed.\n\nA striking parallel exists between the ministries of Jesus and the reported miracles of Muhammad. One notable example is the multiplication of mutton and milk, which was more than enough for forty men. This style of writing makes me believe that the authors aimed to depict Muhammad as a humble prophet, not one driven to prove himself, but one who lived in truth and miracle. This narrative strategy concerns me, as it diminishes the life and message of Jesus Christ, seemingly appropriating and diluting his significance. It's as if they're borrowing from and attempting to claim Jesus' legacy for Muhammad.\n\nFurthermore, the biography attributes great importance to providing evidence of 'witness' and how people 'independently' converted to Islam. However, many stories rely on hearsay, often tracing back to a third-party source. I found this approach off-putting, as it diminishes the stories' authenticity and makes them seem all the more suspicious.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this work is the attempt to elevate Muhammad to a godly figure, emphasizing his humility, gentle nature, and wisdom. Yet, historical accounts contradict this portrayal, and I can't help but wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true circumstances surrounding Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "It's fascinating to note that the core teachings of Jesus have largely been left in the dust as Christianity evolved over the centuries.  If we look at the broader timeline, it's clear that Christianity has gradually strayed further and further from its original roots.  Today, we're witnessing a growing awareness of this trend and an unprecedented desire for progress.  While traditionalists will undoubtedly resist any attempts to move beyond established dogma, their influence may ultimately be outweighed by those craving a deeper understanding of the faith's true origins.  As the years go by, historical awareness will become increasingly widespread among Christians, sparking a yearning to distinguish the doctrines that have been added to the faith from the intentions of its namesake.  This shift may take decades or even centuries, but the end result is inevitable:  Christianity will undergo a great reversal, progressing backward toward its original form.  A movement will gain momentum, shedding layer upon layer of doctrine as if time itself were rewinding, until all that remains is a glimpse of what Jesus brought to humanity on behalf of God, untainted by the interpretations of subsequent thinkers.  As this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, it will draw in the masses, influencing them to worship in a more authentic, Jesus-centric way.  The institutional church will remain strong, guiding the faithful on this journey back to the faith's roots.  However, this reverse trajectory will bring about a surprising consequence: instead of the rich diversity that has characterized Christendom, we can expect to see a growing uniformity of belief and practice across regions, denominations, and divisions.  History is replete with examples of this kind of reversal, such as how the Roman Empire, once a persecutor of Christians, eventually became a bastion of the faith.  Similarly, our country has transitioned from a time of African-American slavery to a era of African-American leadership.  The impending reversion in Christianity will be a remarkable process, undoing centuries of accumulated tradition in search of the original source, and in the process, erasing the very diversity that has come to define the faith.  Crucially, this transformation will be facilitated by a more nuanced approach to Jesus' words, viewing them as metaphors rather than literal statements.  So, what exactly happened since Jesus' time?\n       Looking further back into history, we find that the roots of Christianity lay firmly in Judaism.  By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., the core tenets of the faith were already in place: monotheism, a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures.  However, the Jewish population was far from unified, with various factions like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and common people vying for influence.",
            "The Jungle is an expose that reveals the darker side of human nature - a side where self-interest and greed reign supreme. Beneath the surface, we find individuals consumed by a never-ending pursuit of personal gain, with little regard for anyone or anything else. This is starkly evident in the portrayal of the factory owners and managers, who prioritize profit over people and the environment. As Upton Sinclair vividly illustrates, their relentless drive for growth and expansion leaves a trail of destruction in its wake, as seen in the image of \"the line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" Sinclair's depiction of the pollution and neglect is a scathing indictment of the owners' callous disregard for those affected by their actions.\n\nThe factory owners and managers also demonstrate a lack of concern for their employees, whom they treat as mere commodities to be exploited for their labor. They stop at nothing to maximize profits, regardless of the cost to the workers' well-being, as evident in the statement \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" The employees are subjected to grueling working hours, with little notice or support when they are laid off, often leaving them to fend for themselves in a system with few regulations to protect their rights. The book portrays a system where workers are expected to sacrifice their health and dignity for the sake of their jobs, with no safety net or support to fall back on.\n\nThe era in which The Jungle is set saw a lack of laws and regulations to safeguard workers' rights, allowing the factory owners and managers to operate with impunity. The unions that formed to represent the workers often ended up perpetuating the exploitation, profiting from the very people they were supposed to protect. As a result, the workers were trapped in a cycle of poverty and dependence, with little hope of escape. Sinclair's stark conclusion is that, in this system, immorality and desperation are inevitable, much like under the institution of slavery.",
            "The art of crafting a narrative that evokes a certain mood or attitude in readers is a delicate dance that many authors attempt to master. Not all of these techniques are equally effective, and F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel The Great Gatsby is a prime example of this. To create a lasting impression, Fitzgerald frequently employs a range of literary devices, including juxtaposing words that don't typically go together. He also assigns deeper meanings to symbols, which he then cleverly incorporates into his writing. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald expertly uses colors, like white/gray and red/pink, to build an aura around important subjects.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of Fitzgerald's use of color is the way he imbues white/gray with a sense of uniformity. To him, white connotes elegance and refinement, while gray represents something more aged and worn. He sets the stage for this association early on in the novel by consistently using these colors. For instance, Daisy and Jordan are often depicted wearing white, as are most other characters. Nick sports white flannels at Gatsby's party, Tom wears a white shirt when meeting Myrtle, and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white.\" Conversely, when Nick describes Gatsby's party, the atmosphere is described as \"gaudy with primary colors,\" implying that white is typically reserved for more subdued settings. Fitzgerald reinforces this association by applying these colors to everyday objects and people, such as the \"white chasms of lower New York\" Nick navigates every day, or the \"gray names\" on Nick's schedule.\n\nFitzgerald also uses white and gray to describe common, unremarkable people and places. For example, he describes Jordan and Daisy's shared \"white girlhood,\" the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes, and the \"gray old man\" selling dogs. By applying these colors to the mundane, Fitzgerald creates a sense of sameness, highlighting the monotony of everyday life.\n\nAfter establishing the meaning of white/gray, Fitzgerald uses them to convey a sense of unimportance or uniformity, particularly in relation to Daisy. After a pause in their use, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in a \"little white roadster,\" subtly suggesting that she has become a uniform, almost interchangeable part of Gatsby's world. This technique is repeated when Daisy is described as wearing a \"gray haze of fur collar\" and a \"white\" dress before her encounter with Tom and Gatsby. Through this use of color, Fitzgerald skillfully conveys Daisy's status as a desirable object, rather than a fully fleshed-out character.",
            "The land of San Diego County is a haven for agricultural bounty, thanks to its pleasant climate and an abundance of sunshine. Crops like tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, and peppers thrive in the area. With a strong demand for organic, community-supported agriculture, local farms have long waiting lists. Even organic eggs and milk are in high demand. Many of these farms open their gates to visitors, offering behind-the-scenes tours and opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other leisure activities. This type of operation not only allows landowners to tap into government incentives but also enables them to create a haven for wildlife, promoting biodiversity and offering a chance for educational programs and revenue streams.\n\nWhile organic farming can be a lucrative venture, it also has its own set of challenges. For one, it requires more labor and management to keep pests and weeds at bay without relying on chemicals, and losses can be greater than those experienced by conventional methods. Additionally, small organic farms often can't match the efficiency of larger operations, and practices like planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, and invasive species removal can be labor-intensive and costly. Considering these factors, a landowner in this scenario might seek financial assistance or expert guidance to optimize both profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe land in question is a 160-acre property in unincorporated San Diego County, adjacent to the town of Potrero. It's a diverse landscape of chaparral, nonnative grassland, and oak woodland, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. This area falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which currently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals, many of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the California gnatcatcher, while others are declining and may soon be listed.\n\nFor centuries, Native Americans inhabited this land before it was settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This particular piece of land was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing and wood production for many years.\n\nTo explore the possibilities for a small farmer on this land, I selected a real estate listing and researched government programs that could help mitigate costs and preserve wildlife-friendly practices. As a model of what someone farming this land might aim to achieve, I chose an organic farm in the same region.",
            "The impact of culture on negotiations cannot be overstated. Culture is a multifaceted entity that is often misunderstood or oversimplified. We frequently hear generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating,\" but these broad statements do little to illuminate the complexities of cultural attitudes. A more nuanced understanding of a culture can be gained by recognizing what it signifies and what it is not. In other words, culture is just as much about its absence as its presence.\n\nWhen approaching a foreign culture, we inevitably make comparisons to our own, which can lead to a superficial understanding. To truly grasp a culture, one must delve deeper, studying its history, understanding its prejudices, and acknowledging its idiosyncrasies. Rather than judging or trying to change a culture, it's essential to accept it for what it is and work within its boundaries, especially in the high-stakes world of negotiation.\n\nThe boundaries of culture extend far beyond national or international borders. Corporate cultures can be just as distinct as national cultures, with their own values, norms, and expectations. A company's dress code, communication style, and hiring practices can all reveal its underlying culture. For instance, some companies prioritize long hours in the office, while others encourage a more relaxed schedule. Even within a single company, regional and urban-suburban differences can create diverse subcultures.\n\nTo succeed in negotiation, it's crucial to understand the underlying values of a culture. If, for example, saving face or communal harmony is deeply ingrained in a culture, a negotiator will likely avoid public shaming or confrontation. Conversely, a culture that values a hard-driving bargain may not prioritize settling for a quick agreement. By considering these generalities before the negotiation table, a savvy negotiator can adapt their approach and build a stronger relationship with their opponent.\n\nMoreover, taking the time to learn about an opponent's personal values and motivations can be a game-changer in effective negotiation. By doing so, a negotiator can tailor their approach to the unique cultural context and create a more harmonious and productive discussion.",
            "I often wonder, 'What's the point of even arguing?' As the saying goes, \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" A phrase famously coined in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and later echoed in the writings of St. Anselm. This particular concept seems to be shared by the equally influential Thomas Aquinas, and as we delve into their works, it's clear that their arguments are intertwined. For the sake of simplicity, let's assume both authors believe in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. This allows us to focus on their arguments without getting bogged down in nuances. \n\nAs we explore their views, I'd like to suggest that while both St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas present compelling points, their approaches leave room for improvement. Let's start with Anselm's take. He posits that understanding God begins within ourselves. According to him, we can't fathom a world without God, so we must accept that God exists because it's inherent to our understanding. Anselm's idea is that our minds are the ultimate authority for determining the truth about God, and that external evidence is unnecessary. This concept is at the heart of Christian faith – a leap of trust without concrete proof.\n\nIn stark contrast, Thomas Aquinas takes a more empirical approach. He believes that God's existence can be proven through reason and evidence, freeing Christians from the need for faith. This would be a game-changer for evangelism, allowing converts to be wooed by logic rather than blind faith. Aquinas presents five distinct logical arguments for the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each of these demonstrates that the necessity of God is a logical inevitability, akin to understanding a missing puzzle piece by piecing together the rest of the puzzle.",
            "It all began sometime in the 5th or 6th century BCE with a prince destined to become the revered Buddha. Over the course of his life, he turned his back on worldly pursuits and discovered enlightenment. His teachings eventually gave rise to Buddhism – a 2,500-year-old tradition that has undergone significant transformations since its inception. This evolution can be observed in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is a poignant example. Despite the fact that Buddha never taught about such festivities, monks and lay followers alike participate in this ritual, making it a crucial aspect of their spiritual lives. This divergence from the original teachings is just one of the many ways in which Theravada Buddhism has adapted its theological and philosophical foundations over time. These changes have been influenced by both internal and external forces – some benevolent, others malevolent.\n\nThroughout this discussion, we will frequently use various terms to describe these forces. 'Internal' refers to influences stemming from within the Buddhist community, regardless of one's monastic status. External influences come from outside the community. A hostile force is any element that seeks to harm or damage the Buddhist community, often stemming from a negative perception of Buddhism. In contrast, a benign force has no intention to harm or assist the community, although it may inadvertently have one of these effects.\n\nLet's start by examining the fundamental principles of Theravada Buddhism – the core doctrines that have guided the community for centuries. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is comprised of the Tripitaka – the three baskets of sacred texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. These notions include the concepts of Anatta – the absence of a permanent self, Dukkha – the inherent suffering in life, and Anicca – the impermanence of everything. By acknowledging these fundamental truths, one can break free from Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, and ultimately eliminate lobha – desire, dosa – hatred, and moha – delusion. The Vinaya Pitaka outlines the rules for lay followers, such as the five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not engage in misconduct, and I shall not consume intoxicating substances). Monks, on the other hand, adhere to a more extensive set of disciplinary rules. The four noble truths form the foundation of Buddhist doctrine: the first, that life is suffering; the second, that attachment is the root cause of suffering; and the third, that suffering can be overcome.",
            "It's hard to believe how the United States and Mexico were once locked in a 57-year rivalry that lasted from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The rivalry reached its peak with the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the US came out on top, claiming Texas and the American Southwest as its own territory. This wasn't an isolated incident – there were many other clashes between the two nations before the First World War finally brought an end to the hostilities. \n\nThis long-standing rivalry was fueled by deep-seated differences between Americans and Mexicans on issues like faith, culture, and tradition (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31). Sound familiar? This isn't a unique scenario – neighboring nations often clash over competing interests, leading to enduring rivalries. The US and Mexico are just one example of a pair of nations that, despite sharing a border, struggled to see eye-to-eye. David M. Pletcher (1977) noted that Mexico and Cuba are the only Latin American nations that have presented long-term diplomatic challenges for the US (p. 41). It's no coincidence that they're both geographically close to the US and have a history of rivalry.\n\nReligious differences were a major point of contention between the two nations, a problem that has plagued many countries throughout history. As Sally Frahm (2001) pointed out, \"if Americans opposed fascism and communism in the 20th century, they were once opposed to Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries\" (p. 86). This ideological struggle was as much about competing interests as it was about differing values. In this case, the ideological differences were rooted in the religious preferences of the two nations, a legacy of the distrust between the English and Spanish empires. This inherited animosity made it difficult for the US and Mexico to establish a positive relationship.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) documented 17 disputes between Mexico and the US during the 57-year rivalry period. Most of these disputes centered on territorial issues, including border raids from Mexican territory and other frontier problems. Border violence, particularly from American border towns, was a persistent issue until the US and Mexico finally exerted military force to control their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).\n\nAs Schmitt (1974) noted, the rivalry began to subside as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the US (p. 109) and American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (p. 110) in the late 19th century. This marked the end of the long-standing rivalry between the two nations.",
            "It was 15 years ago that an unexpected illness suddenly rendered me unable to work. At the time, I was a nurse, a profession I had chosen for the security and stability it promised, a sense of safety I desperately craved as a child. The mantra that echoed through my adolescence and beyond was \"you'll always find work; people will always get sick.\" So, I put aside my dream of becoming a scientist or journalist to pursue a more practical path.\n\nNow, at 46, I'm single, broke, and living on the fragile support of Social Security Disability. Fifteen years have passed, and I've lost everything that truly belongs to me. Each day is a struggle, a relentless assault on my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. The only constant in my life is the unwavering support of my family and a few loyal friends, who've been my lifeline in times of crisis.\n\nDespite my strength, I've come to realize that when disaster strikes, it's a cruel illusion to think you can face it alone. Life's emergencies, whether big or small, are a guarantee. No amount of preparation can shield you from the overwhelming forces that life throws at you.\n\nI agree that our reliance on the government is a fragile foundation, but I firmly believe it's time for Americans to rediscover the value of trust, community, and mutual aid. Rather than building individual shelters, we should be learning to support one another, to ask for help when needed, and to offer a helping hand in times of need.\n\nThe concept of rugged individualism, touted by Conservatives as the backbone of American spirit, is a myth. Our forefathers didn't survive the harsh realities of frontier life alone; they thrived on compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains knew that working together was the only way to reach their destination.\n\nSo, by all means, prepare for the unexpected. I've stocked my disaster kit with essentials, from first aid supplies to water purification tablets and duct tape. I've got flashlights, batteries, candles, and canned goods, ready for any eventuality. But while you're at it, take a step further – get to know your neighbors.\n\nBy building connections and fostering a sense of community, we can create a safety net that's stronger than any government program or emergency kit. It's time to rediscover the values that truly made America great: compassion, mutual respect, and a willingness to help one another in times of need.",
            "I've always wondered, what drives organisms to evolve the way they do? Are there hidden rules, constraints that shape the path of evolutionary change? The field has been puzzling over this question for a long time, and even Darwin's contemporary, D'Arcy Thompson, noted in 1917 that scientists were still struggling to quantify the simplest forms of life. Fast-forward to today, and while we've made progress, we still have a long way to go. Recently, some scientists have applied mathematical modeling to the way mollusks grow their shells, looking at both how they develop over time (ontogeny) and how they've changed over millions of years (phylogeny). Our study is taking a similar approach, using math and experiments to figure out what drives the twists and turns of evolutionary change in a group of snails called Prunum.\n\nWe started by studying X-ray images of Prunum shells to identify key characteristics that could help us model how their shells might change over time. These characteristics were then plugged into a software program called CerioShell, which let us simulate different shell shapes and sizes. By comparing these hypothetical shells to real ones, we're hoping to get a better understanding of how Prunum shells have evolved over time.\n\nShells are like a spiral staircase, growing outward in a continuous loop. Each turn of the shell is called a whorl, and they're connected by a line called a suture. The largest whorl is the last one, called the body whorl, and the tip of the shell is the apex. As the shell grows, the animal extends out through an opening called the aperture. By looking at shells from different angles – apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural – we can get a better sense of their shape and size.\n\nTo count the number of whorls, you need to look at the shell from the top and find the first suture. Then, draw a line and start counting from there, estimating to a quarter of a whorl if necessary. By mapping out the path of the aperture through time and space, we can see how the shell has grown and changed over time. This journey can be represented mathematically and graphically, allowing us to experiment with different parameters and see how they affect the shell's development.\n\nBy combining math and experiments, we're one step closer to understanding the mysteries of evolutionary change in Prunum.",
            "For the past decade, Indonesia has witnessed a stagnation in neonatal and infant mortality rates.  While the country is making progress in achieving some of the Millennium Development Goals, such as water and sanitation targets, the rate of improvement in child and maternal health has fallen woefully short of the required target by 2015.  The multitude of factors behind this lag will be discussed below, suggesting a need to fortify the health system rather than focusing on programmatic interventions.\n\nIndonesia has seen an increase in the number of births attended by skilled healthcare workers, with 72% now meeting this benchmark.  However, this statistic also includes traditional attendants like midwives who cannot provide medical assistance in complicated cases, thus contributing to the high rate of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage.  Consequently, the improvements in this indicator are somewhat misleading, and there is still much work to be done.  Moreover, there has been a decline in the percentage of children under five treated by a healthcare professional for diarrheal cases.  The data on postnatal care is incomplete, but it is evident that this area is a concern, with low rates across the country.\n\nThe rate of cesarean sections remains alarmingly low at around 4%, and another red flag is raised by the fact that these rates are 7% in urban settings, but only 2% in rural areas.  This disparity highlights the issue of unequal access to healthcare services across the country, with urban areas receiving more attention.  The problem of vertical equity is also apparent, with a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, indicating that the poor are struggling to access healthcare services due to high out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen considering the next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most fundamental question is how to effectively address the shortage of services.  Specifically, should Indonesia opt for program-specific approaches or strengthen its overall health system without focusing solely on pre and post-pregnancy care for mothers and children?  While programmatic approaches to address the problems outlined may seem attractive, they have drawbacks.  For instance, heavily investing in a single area can divert resources away from other critical sectors, leading to a brain drain of human resources towards the more funded area.  Furthermore, running multiple parallel programs can result in duplication of services, uncoordinated efforts, and an increase in paperwork and administrative burdens.",
            "Victorian novels are often characterized by their meticulous attention to detail, frequently focusing on the aristocracy of the era.  However, two notable exceptions are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, which stray from this tradition by incorporating elements of mystery and the bizarre, characteristics not typically associated with Victorian fiction. These elements add depth to the characters within each novel, providing insight into their motivations and emotions.\n\nThe narrative of Oliver Twist is riddled with bewildering and confusing ideas as the protagonist navigates the dark world he inhabits. He finds himself caught between the turbulent lives of Sikes and Crackit, who are locked in a heated dispute. The words they exchange echo in his mind, making it difficult for him to distinguish reality from fantasy. In a state of disorientation, he's suddenly jolted back to reality by the sound of gunfire, and the world around him descends into chaos. A sense of unease and pain lingers, haunting him as he's whisked away by an unseen force. This passage from Dickens' work illustrates the unsettling nature of Oliver's world, where he's often overwhelmed by the harsh realities that surround him.\n\nOliver Twist and Wuthering Heights employ the use of dream sequences or dreamlike states to convey the mystery within their narratives. In Oliver Twist, these strange occurrences often reveal Oliver's inner turmoil, offering a glimpse into his deepest pains and fears. When the shooting incident is revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the moment vividly, as if stuck in a dream, while desperately searching for help. This passage underscores the lack of control Oliver has over the events unfolding around him, highlighting his dire situation and the trauma he's endured. As he's overwhelmed by the memory of the shooting, the question arises as to whose will is at play, suggesting that Oliver's misfortune may not be his own doing. This reinforces the idea that he's at the mercy of forces beyond his control, leaving him feeling defeated and powerless to act.\n\nSimilarly, Wuthering Heights is marked by long, oppressive nights that stretch on forever, yet seem to pass by in an instant. The day is always fleeting, and the silence is oppressive, making the hours feel like an eternity. This sense of timelessness is a fitting backdrop for the turmoil that unfolds within the novel.",
            "A couple of years ago, I was working with an after-school program where I tutored elementary-age students in various subjects. I did my best to help them in the areas where they were struggling, but my strengths lay in English and reading. One student, a young boy named Adrian, really caught my attention – he was in third or fourth grade, I think. He had a peculiar problem with reading, which only became apparent as I worked with him. Some letters were no-brainers for him, while others left him stumped, which was bizarre. Given his likely Latino background, I was taken aback by his perfect English skills, but it all started to make sense when I met his mother.\n\nThe moment she walked in, speaking only Spanish, it hit me like a ton of bricks: Adrian's literacy issues weren't about reading itself, but the English alphabet and its pronunciation. I realize now that my limited Spanish skills at the time made communication a bit of a challenge, but we managed to convey our message. That epiphany led me to wonder if that revelation ever helped him in the long run, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier issue in schools, particularly in California, and to show that it's not always as straightforward as we think. Even for kids who speak perfect English, reading can be a significant hurdle. I believe everyone acknowledges this problem, so what's the solution? In Adrian's case, it was as simple as targeted English reading tutoring, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for kids who barely speak English, it's a much more complex issue. There's no one-size-fits-all answer. We can't rely on any single method – dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutors, or ESL classes – to solve this problem. The key lies in combining multiple approaches.\n\nOne thing that stands out is the dual language system, which is an excellent idea not just for kids who speak Spanish as their first language but for all students. Research shows that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. A lot of misconceptions surround this idea, claiming it's a waste of resources and that most students won't benefit. But that's a false assumption. If we implemented these programs as the norm, rather than the exception, all children would benefit from them. So, how do we make it happen? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? That's unrealistic and unreasonable. Instead, I think we can have bilingual aids, tutors, or whatever we want to call them, to support students in the classroom.",
            "We've all been conditioned from a young age that there's something greater than ourselves, something that transcends our understanding. Some of us are raised in Sunday school, while others explore their spirituality through meditation or introspection. Many of us stick to the faith passed down to us by our parents, but some reject it altogether, opting instead for a more personalized worldview. We navigate a complex landscape of spirituality, searching for our own unique answers to the mysteries of the universe. Our quest for meaning often begins with a desire to escape the darkness and find solace in the light.\n\nOne rainy evening, I recall sitting on the porch with my father, watching the gutters overflow with rainwater, drowning the plants at the edge of the step. He stared out into the downpour, a look that was both distant and introspective. His health had taken a turn for the worse, and his once robust physique had given way to a more gaunt appearance. His hair had thinned, and his eyes seemed to be searching for something beyond the present moment. I felt a deep sense of unease and longing, but the words caught in my throat, unable to articulate the depth of my sorrow. I hugged him, sat back down beside him, and joined him in gazing out into the rain-soaked twilight, the sound of the raindrops a melancholy serenade.\n\nMy father passed away in December, just five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation had prolonged his life, but at what cost, I couldn't help but wonder. What kind of higher power would allow this suffering? In the dead of night, I found myself praying not to a deity, but to an empty void, as if pleading for an answer that never came. If there was a God, I thought, he had long since stopped listening to my pleas.\n\nI couldn't bring myself to witness my father's final moments. I chose to remember him by his life, not his passing. I knew him better than anyone else, and I knew he wouldn't have wanted me to be a spectator to his death. For three days, I curled up in my bed, waiting for the news that would change everything. But the silence was deafening – no one called to share the news with me.",
            "I've always found it fascinating how the term \"Gothic Novel\" seems to be an oxymoron - an \"old-new\" hybrid, as Ian Watt puts it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. For years, the Gothic mode has been both maligned and lauded, with some arguing it lacks depth and others praising its \"terrible sublime\" qualities (Burke). I suspect this duality stems from the genre's roots in a bygone era. The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, cleverly combined elements from both \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances to birth the proto-Gothic genre. By blending the old with the new, Walpole created a new form of literary expression. The Gothic genre drew inspiration from medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions, yet it was often seen as old-fashioned and unsophisticated in comparison to the \"modern\" literary and societal advancements of its time.\n\nOne of the defining characteristics of Gothic novels is the idea of chivalry, a medieval concept that emphasizes the virtues of a proper knight. This notion, as seen in The Castle of Otranto, is not only retained but also transformed. Chivalry, particularly in the context of the Gothic novel, represents an idealized and romanticized version of the past - a time when knights were brave, honorable, and competent. This nostalgic portrayal hints at the future evolution of Gothic into Romantic literature. Walpole, who wrote The Castle of Otranto during a tumultuous period, may have been attempting to critique the present by idealizing the past. His character Frederic, for instance, embodies many chivalric traits - he's a prince, a victim of tragedy, and a gallant and courteous figure. This exaggerated portrayal of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" sets the stage for the Gothic trope of excess.",
            "As I sit here, pondering the intricacies of the business world, I find myself reflecting on the concept of supply chain management - that intricate dance of moving goods from customer orders to raw materials, supply, production, and distribution, all the way to the customer's doorstep. It's a process that has been around since 1982, when consultant Keith Oliver coined the term. Oliver described the elaborate process of planning, implementing, and controlling the supply chain to satisfy customers' needs in a swift and efficient manner. The puzzle pieces of supply chain management revolve around six key elements: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information.\n\nA manager's best friend in this supply chain game is the production stage, the foundation upon which the entire process stands. It's the moment when the 'when, why, where, and how' of production is outlined. To get to this point, managers must tap into the market, that elusive indicator of customer demand. By studying the market, managers can determine what customers crave, and in turn, decide what products to produce, how many to produce, and where to produce them. It's a delicate balancing act, keeping in mind the customer's satisfaction and demand.\n\nOnce the production location is chosen, the focus shifts to scheduling workloads and equipment maintenance - a task that requires precision, as every detail counts. A minor misstep can cost a company dearly in the long run. I recall my days working at retail giants like Wal-Mart and Target, where every aspect of the business, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments, was meticulously planned out in a detailed booklet. Having a clear plan of action ensures that the company runs smoothly, without confusion or misdirection.\n\nSupply, the second key element in the supply chain management equation, involves strategic decisions about a company's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. It's a delicate dance of determining which divisions of production are best suited for each process, and when to outsource work to other companies. The goal is to create 'velocity' - the ability to provide quality, flexibility, and low costs. It's a juggling act that requires a manager's deft touch.",
            "A haunting message scrawled on a street corner, a stark reminder of the oppressed. Ellen Page, the talented star of Juno, stands alone, a cardboard sign held high above her head, the bold words \"Hitler is alive in Burma\" written in Sharpie. Burma, or Myanmar, a Southeast Asian nation ruled by a ruthless military junta that seized power in 1962 through a violent coup d'état. Just a decade ago, in 2007, a series of protests erupted, dubbed the \"Saffron Revolution,\" as thousands of Burmese monks took to the streets, donning their iconic saffron robes. The government, though initially tolerant, soon cracked down, unleashing a brutal crackdown on the peaceful gatherings. Journalists were arrested and foreign reporters, including Japanese photojournalist Kenji Nagai, were killed for simply bearing witness. The official death toll stands at 13, but Colonel Hla Win, a defector from the army, revealed a chilling truth: \"The bodies can be counted in several thousand.\"\n\nThis is just a grim snapshot of a timeless tale. The desire to silence dissent and maintain control has been a hallmark of governments throughout history. From ancient Rome, where emperors claimed divine right to rule, to modern-day leaders who seek to crush opposition, this pattern persists. Japanese emperors were considered gods, sent to guide their people towards prosperity, while our own president, George W. Bush, reportedly held clandestine meetings with Ted Haggard, leader of a fundamentalist group. The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China, the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, and, of course, the atrocities of the Third Reich all serve as stark reminders of the dangers of unchecked power.",
            "The inimitable legacy of Duke Ellington in the realm of jazz can be largely attributed to his remarkable longevity, which, in turn, allowed him to continually shape and evolve his orchestra. Though his piano playing is often understated in many of his compositions, Ellington's prowess as a composer is undeniable, particularly in his ability to craft rich, complex pieces that showcased the diverse talents of his band members. By carefully crafting the framework for improvisation, as well as writing intricately orchestrated passages that highlighted the unique styles of individual musicians, Ellington created a distinctive sound that was both original and coherent. His deep understanding of each player's voice and how they blended together in the ensemble enabled him to compose some of the most groundbreaking and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary provides insight into Ellington's innovative approach to sound, citing his use of voice as a \"jazz instrument\" in Creole Love Call, an early example of his ability to incorporate vocal texture without the constraints of lyrics. This slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece exemplifies Ellington's skill in complementing the style of his soloists, a characteristic that defines his career. The piece unfolds over six choruses, each with its own distinct character:\n\nChorus 1: A call-and-response exchange between voice and reeds, where the voice begins with a smooth, melodic tone, gradually shifting to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that expands on the basic melody, emphasizing several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus, with a call-and-response exchange between the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus, as the reeds initiate the call-and-response, backed by syncopated stop-time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the first chorus's structure, with call-and-response between voice and reeds. In this final chorus, the voice adopts the growl technique, soloing like an instrument.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is but one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington masterfully combines his expertise in orchestration with his ear for tone color. The call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing is a prime example of Ellington's ability to create a rich, complementary sound by blending vocal and instrumental elements. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) further explores these ideas, as Ellington skillfully utilizes Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone to introduce the melody.",
            "It was a nagging void that had plagued her since adolescence - a sense of yearning that she couldn't quite quench. It started when she was 14, right in the midst of navigating the ups and downs of being a teenager. Three years later, at 17, the feeling still lingered, but now she was convinced it was a desire for connection with someone, not just a thing. Yet, despite the attention from a few boys, none of them had truly piqued her interest. She often found herself lost in self-reflection, searching for answers to this enigma. Theories had surfaced over the years, but nothing had ever felt quite right. Life went on, with her constantly questioning her desires, searching for a resolution.\n\nHer home life was typically a serene sanctuary. Her parents were calm and peaceful individuals who rarely argued with each other. Oddly enough, they were even less likely to argue with their daughter, who was always trying to assert her independence and vibrant personality. This dynamic created an interesting contrast between her parents' tranquility and her lively, outgoing nature, making her even more endearing to those around her.\n\nBut this particular day was different. As she wandered from room to room, seeking inspiration, she was jolted by a blood-curdling scream from the kitchen. Her mother's melodious voice pierced the air, followed by her frantic words. She rushed into the kitchen, panic setting in as she frantically asked, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" Her mother lay on the ground, writhing in pain, repeatedly muttering \"Ow\" in short gasps. Her daughter rushed to her side, placing a hand on her to offer support. \"Ouch... sweetie, I... need you to take me to... the hospital.\" The words tumbled out in a rush, and her daughter could sense the gravity of her mother's pain. \"Okay, Mom, just show me where to pick you up.\" Her mother pointed, and in that moment, her daughter was grateful for her fitness classes, which had prepared her to take on this unexpected role. She gently lifted her mother and drove her to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital's sterile atmosphere, heavy with the scent of disinfectant and illness, was a daunting place. But her daughter's focus was solely on helping her mother. She swiftly carried her in and called for the doctors, who quickly arrived to assess the situation. A few worried faces gathered around as they rushed her mother onto a rolling bed. The medical team whisked her away, leaving her daughter to sit anxiously, her mind racing with concern.\n\nIt turned out her mother had taken a tumble off a stool while trying to retrieve a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the benefits of adhering to the Mediterranean Diet (Med diet), as measured by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" in reducing the risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke mortality. The aMed diet is a variation of the Med diet that emphasizes higher consumption of plant foods, including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, while limiting saturated fats and animal products, with moderate alcohol intake allowed.\n\nPrevious studies have shown a connection between adherence to the Med diet and a lower risk of total and cardiovascular mortality, and an intervention trial found the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and improving cholesterol ratios in obese individuals. However, these studies did not specifically examine the relationship between the Med diet and stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study, which followed 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, free of heart disease or diabetes, utilized data from the Nurses' Health Study, a comprehensive cohort study of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Over six intervals between 1984 and 2004, researchers calculated an aMed diet score based on self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs), which assessed nutrient intake over a one-year period. Remarkably, over 95% of participants continued their participation throughout the 20-year study.\n\nTo validate the accuracy of FFQs, each report of heart disease, fatal heart disease, and stroke was cross-checked against medical records, hospital records, autopsy reports, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, \"probable\" cases were included, accounting for approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts.\n\nTo mitigate the impact of individual fluctuations and better represent long-term dietary habits, cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging scores from two preceding years). The researchers also controlled for potential confounding factors, such as age, smoking status, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing Cox proportional-hazard modeling, the study found that a higher aMed diet score was associated with a reduced risk of heart disease and stroke in women. Over the course of 20 years, a total of 2,391 incident CHD cases, 1,763 incident strokes, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were documented. Women in the top aMed quintile exhibited a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "We're still reeling from the economic earthquake that shook the United States to its core in 2007. Unemployment skyrocketed, the housing market imploded, and some of America's top corporations crumbled to the ground. And here we are, still grappling with the wreckage – so it's only natural to wonder: how did this catastrophe unfold, and can we prevent it from happening again? In a nutshell, the financial crisis was triggered by shortsighted and reckless government policies that pushed banks and financial institutions to hand out subprime loans to those who couldn't afford them, against the backdrop of a fragile and underprepared financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) got saddled with underwriting and repackaging these dodgy mortgages into CDOs and CDSs, which had disastrous consequences when borrowers defaulted on their payments.\n\nThe roots of the financial crisis stretch back to 1999, when President Clinton was on a mission to secure a second term. He sought to boost his popularity by easing lending regulations, setting the stage for the subprime crisis that would unfold seven years later. As Steven Holmes of the New York Times astutely observed in 1999, Fannie Mae – the country's largest underwriter of home mortgages – was feeling the heat from the Clinton administration to make more loans to low- and moderate-income borrowers, while also being pressed by shareholders to maintain its impressive profit growth. Holmes prophetically warned of the potential consequences: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may struggle in an economic downturn, prompting a government bailout similar to the one for the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As we now know, poorly advised lending would lead to an economic meltdown.\n\nA perfect storm of factors contributed to the economic freefall, including the proliferation of innovative but complicated mortgage products like adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These complex financial instruments entwined the housing market with other sectors of the economy, leaving U.S. households and financial markets perilously exposed to even slight changes in housing prices. And then, as if on cue, the housing bubble burst, leaving financial institutions that had invested in mortgage-backed securities reeling. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007 – a staggering 30% of the country's GDP. In the aftermath, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at fire-sale prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to convert to commercial banks subject to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie, meanwhile, were left with a whopping $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were taken under government control in September 2008.",
            "The thrill of exposition - that moment when writers stretch their wings and soar, leaving readers in awe of their prose.  Or, more often, the part where readers' eyelids droop and they hastily click the \"Back\" button, muttering a curse under their breath.  Dr. Merlin has been known to pound her keyboard in frustration when she finds herself stuck in a quagmire of unnecessary details, and it's not the fun kind of frustration.\n\nExposition is not a friend to writers.\n\nEven seasoned writers like Dr. Merlin still fall prey to long, meandering passages that leave nothing but a sense of tedium in their wake.  We know the essential writing tip: \"Show, don't tell,\" but it's a hard habit to break.  Exposition is that pesky voice in our heads that whispers, \"Get the backstory over with so we can get to the good stuff\" (not to be confused with the voice that urges us to reveal every intimate detail of our characters' pasts).\n\nSo, what is exposition? It's the act of telling the reader what's happened, usually in straightforward language.  In film, it's the scene where one character dumps a load of information on another (think \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\").  In fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nLet's take a look at an example.  Imagine a story where the heroine meets her beloved, gets married in a grand ceremony, and her husband is brutally murdered before her eyes.  You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to unfold over two pages, with both characters only uttering a few words.  You'd want to see more of the husband's character come alive through his words and actions, and the heroine's transformation as she falls in love with him.  You'd want to feel the depth of their bond, the impact his presence has on her life, and the clues that hint at her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams.  By doing this, you'd become invested in his fate and hers, and mourn his loss alongside her.  That's what makes a story come alive - the meat on the bone of the plot: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs writers, we need to provide that meat.  Sometimes it's tempting to rush past certain details, but the payoff is worth the extra effort.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and know he used to be in the Air Force, now works the night shift at a gas station, has been married twice, has no kids, and dreams of owning the gas station someday.  Don't just give the reader a laundry list of facts - show us through his actions, dialogue, and expressions why these details matter.  Give your readers a reason to care about this character and the world you're creating.",
            "I tuned in to the local news from Columbus, Ohio, and witnessed two newscasts, one on August 13, 2011. The first one, NBC 4's live broadcast in the morning, caught my attention with a particularly disturbing story. A man named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio, had allegedly stabbed his wife, though her name was not mentioned. His mug shot was displayed, and he looked every inch the embodiment of malevolence. Not surprisingly, this developing story received only two minutes of airtime. I think they devoted an adequate amount of time to the story, considering its gravity.\n\nThe second story told the heart-wrenching tale of an 18-year-old named Travis Buyers, who was shot in the Sharon Woods area. He was left critically injured, and at the time, no arrests had been made or suspects identified. The SWAT Team was hot on the case. I couldn't help but feel that this story received short shrift, and I suspect the reason might be rooted in the fact that the victim was a young black man from a predominantly black neighborhood. I've observed this phenomenon before – minorities are often overlooked when they're victims of crime. In contrast, when a white child or adult falls victim, the media sensationalizes the story, whereas a minority victim is lucky to receive minimal coverage. \n\nSubsequent stories included an investigation into a gunshot hole found on a Med-Flight helicopter. Details were provided about the possible location of the incident, and it was determined that a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle was responsible. Crime-Stoppers offered a substantial reward, $5,000, for any information leading to the arrest of the perpetrator.\n\nThe forecast for the weekend mentioned rain and thunderstorms on Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to hover in the mid-to-low eighties. The segment was brief, but I suspect the anchor wanted to use it as a teaser to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nAnother story highlighted the robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The perpetrator, described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt, was allegedly around six feet tall and weighed around 150 pounds. I found it striking that they devoted an inordinate amount of time to emphasizing the robber's skin tone and the darkness of his complexion.\n\nLastly, a story reported on Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas-based marijuana kingpin who had been sentenced to 300 months in prison for conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana to Ohio from Texas. I couldn't help but notice that they chose to mention his Hispanic heritage, which seemed irrelevant to the story. It left me wondering if they thought it added a layer of gravity to the narrative or if it was simply a gratuitous detail.",
            "There's an unbreakable bond between brothers, a connection that runs deeper than words can express. This bond is a complex web of emotions - love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty - all intertwined like the threads of a rich tapestry. Brothers have a unique understanding of each other, one that transcends the boundaries of ordinary relationships. When the chips are down and things get tough, the true nature of this bond is revealed, whether it's beautiful or ugly. The cost of this bond is steep, and it's only when we confront the consequences of our actions that we can truly understand its power. When we look at our brother and see our own reflection staring back, we're forced to confront the truth about ourselves - our flaws, our strengths, and our true character. This is a theme that's expertly woven throughout William Faulkner's \"The Scarlet Ibis\", a haunting tale of two brothers locked in a dance of emotions. Set against the backdrop of a lush, vivid landscape, their journey is a futile yet poignant one, marked by the bitter clash of disappointment and pride. Ultimately, only one brother emerges unscathed, leaving the other to grapple with the devastating consequences of their actions.\n\nAt the heart of this story is the protagonist's all-consuming pride. From the moment he and his little brother, Doodle, set out together, he's driven by a sense of resentment towards the younger boy. He'd envisioned a brother who could share in his adventures, who could keep up with his wild spirit and thirst for excitement. But Doodle's fragile health dashes those hopes, leaving the protagonist feeling frustrated and angry. He's even shown to harbor a dark secret - a desire to eliminate the perceived burden that Doodle represents. Yet, in a subtle yet telling moment, his defenses crumble when he catches Doodle's smile. This fleeting glimpse of joy humanizes the protagonist, revealing a love for his brother that's been there all along. It's a love that's not always easy to acknowledge, but it's a love that ultimately redeems him.\n\nThrough the protagonist's actions and interactions with Doodle, Faulkner masterfully explores the complexities of brotherly love and the consequences that come with it. The narrator's perspective adds another layer of depth to the story, offering a glimpse into the protagonist's inner world and the emotions that drive him. As we follow the brothers on their fateful journey, we're forced to confront the darker aspects of human nature - our own flaws, our own capacity for cruelty and love. In the end, it's a powerful reminder that the bonds we form with others are the greatest teachers of all, and that it's only by confronting our own reflections that we can truly grow and change.",
            "I've often found myself wondering about the intricate workings of the human brain, a complex information-processing system that's as baffling as it is fascinating. Over time, our understanding of the brain has evolved, much like the technology that's revolutionized our lives. We've likened it to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, then a book, and more recently, to a computer. While these metaphors have been helpful in describing the brain's functions, they also have their limitations, often leading us down a path of misconceptions.\n\nThe journey of information processing begins with the sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli like touch, heat, and light into electrical signals. This process is a series of transformations, where the brain's algorithms work their magic, both bottom-up and top-down. For instance, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing assembles basic information like color, orientation, and object borders to determine that you're seeing a box. Meanwhile, top-down processing uses the decisions made earlier to expedite your recognition of the box, perhaps helping you identify it as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole.\n\nAs information is processed to some extent, an attention filter decides its importance and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name in a noisy room. This process of processing and filtering is repeated at multiple stages, with attention modulating the results each time.\n\nFor the brain to process information effectively, it must first store it. There are various types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. Information is initially encoded, with different types of encoding suited to each type of sensory stimulus. For instance, verbal input can be encoded structurally, phonemically, or semantically. Once information is stored, it needs to be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores info for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a specific series of neurons for a short period. Long-term memory, on the other hand, is thought to be maintained in the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are numerous models of how knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on human subjects' memory retrieval, others inspired by computer science, and others rooted in neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented by nodes, connected based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In his seminal novel Brave New World, Aldous Huxley issues a dire warning about the dangers of unchecked technological advancement and the capitalist systems that fuel it. His dystopian vision paints a picture of a future where individuals are conditioned to prioritize short-term happiness above all else, surrendering their autonomy to a rigid community that suppresses individuality. The citizens of this world are mere pawns in a game controlled by the World Controller, forced to conform to a single ideology that permeates every aspect of their lives. A closer examination of the text through the lens of Marxist theory reveals Huxley's scathing critique of the emerging economic systems of his time, with Marxist concepts like homogeny and reification providing a framework for understanding the novel's underlying themes.\n\nHuxley's satirical take on capitalism is particularly noteworthy, as he employs the Marxist concept of false consciousness to highlight the ways in which the common citizenry is kept in the dark about the true nature of their relationships with other economic classes. The people are conditioned through hypnopædia to crave consumption, indulgence, and self-gratification, effectively rendering them pawns in a game controlled by the ruling elite. The lower classes, exemplified by the Delta and Gamma castes, are oblivious to the manipulation, while the upper classes, represented by the Alphas and Betas, are complicit in their own oppression, refusing to challenge the status quo.\n\nThe relationships between individuals in Brave New World are shallow and lacking in depth, suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism is eroding humanity's capacity for genuine emotional expression and free will. Love, in particular, is absent from this world, replaced by superficial interactions that prioritize physical appearance over substance. The societal classes' complacency with their assigned roles in the hierarchy serves as a testament to the insidious effects of capitalist ideology, where individuals are conditioned to believe they are superior to others as long as they conform and consume.\n\nHuxley's work offers a searing indictment of the dehumanizing effects of capitalist systems, where individuals are reduced to mere automatons, devoid of autonomy and agency. By exploring the intersections of technology, capitalism, and human relationships, Huxley challenges readers to consider the consequences of creating a world where individuality and free will are sacrificed for the sake of efficiency and conformity.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for nearly three years now, or roughly five semesters. For many, including myself, navigating this campus can be a real challenge. My first year, I was stuck in an East Halls dorm room, essentially the easternmost outpost of campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Commuting from my Stuart Hall digs to classes in places like the Willard building, which is actually closer to the center of campus, would take around 25 minutes on foot, especially when the weather's less than ideal, which is often the case in State College. I had a conversation with an alum not much older than me, and it turns out that not so long ago, the East Halls dorms were isolated from the rest of the school by huge swaths of empty land. Today, that vacant space has been transformed into sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and the health services building, and swanky new apartments. As the campus continues to expand, getting around becomes increasingly complicated. So, what's the solution to this mobility conundrum? On a college campus, I firmly believe that the bicycle is the answer. However, a bike alone won't solve the problem; students need to ride them, and the campus architecture needs to accommodate the needs of bicyclists.\n\nI recently spoke with a friend who's recently taken up bicycling again after a hiatus, and he confessed that he wondered why he stopped in the first place. \"Bikes are great,\" he said, \"for a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Not only is bicycling good for your physical health, it's also the most efficient mode of transportation. A bowl of oatmeal and a bit of physical exertion can take you 30 miles or more. Like many of my fellow undergrads, I currently live off campus, just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. I made the smartest decision of the year when I bought a bike. I have class every day in Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my place. With a bike, I can cut that time down to just 5 minutes if I pedal hard enough. The only catch is that Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas building from my house, isn't always the most bike-friendly road. There are pros to walking, of course, but personally, I'm too busy to walk. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option, and it would take around 30-40 minutes each way, adding up to over two and a half hours every week. Factor in all the other time I'd spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and the like, and that's more time than I can spare."
