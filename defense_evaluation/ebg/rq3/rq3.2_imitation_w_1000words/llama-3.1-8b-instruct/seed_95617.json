            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "I've always felt a deep desire to make a positive impact on the lives of others, particularly children who have been dealt a rough hand. As I pursue a degree in social work, I'm drawn to the Division of Family and Children Services, where I can be a source of comfort and support for those in need. At the heart of my approach are several core values: a commitment to service, respect for those I serve, and an unwavering dedication to ethics. I believe in striving to improve relationships between individuals and families, while also continually honing my skills to stay ahead in the field. These values aren't just professional ideals; they're deeply ingrained in my personal character.\n\nFor a long time, I was torn about my career path. I'd witness friends and classmates struggling with problems, and some would cope with unhealthy tactics. Those experiences led me to major in Psychology in college. Even with that degree, I still felt uncertain about my future. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break to figure things out. That's when my life took a dramatic turn. One summer, I visited a friend, and she introduced me to a 16-year-old boy who was visibly shaken. He was there to escape his abusive home life. The next day, I found out he'd called the police, and I decided to intervene. I drove to his parents' house, explained my concerns to the authorities, and shared my background as a recent Psychology graduate. The police asked me to speak with the parents, as they were at a loss for what to do. When I questioned the parents, they seemed evasive, making excuses for their son's actions. That encounter left a lasting impression on me, and I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help families resolve conflicts peacefully.\n\nSocial justice is another value that drives me in this field. We claim to value individuality, but our society often pressures people to conform. I've always been drawn to authenticity and self-expression. In high school and college, I made a point to challenge social norms: I dyed my hair bold colors, wore clothes that reflected my personality, got piercings that made a statement, joined the GSBA, and spoke out against racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it. I believe in fighting for what's right, and I'll continue to do so.",
            "As I delve into the realm of insomnia, I find myself entwined in the complex dance between biological and sociocultural models. The biological model peels back the layers, revealing the intricate web of genetic information and medical aspects that contribute to this sleep disorder. Conversely, the sociocultural model takes a step back, examining the environmental relationships that weave together race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review embarks on a journey to dissect these models, scrutinizing research that sheds light on the intricacies of insomnia and its underlying causes.\n\nInsomnia can be categorized into three distinct umbrellas: primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders tied to mental health, and sleep disorders linked to medical complications or substance intake. The primary sleep disorders are either Dyssonmias or Parasomnias. Dyssonmias, which include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, and others, are characterized by difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep. Conversely, Parasomnias, such as Nightmare Disorder and Sleep Terror Disorder, are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and physiological occurrences.\n\nAs I navigate the labyrinth of sleep disorders, I find myself questioning the role of genetics and physiology in the development of insomnia. Research has shown that neurons in the hypothalamus, specifically those containing orexin, play a pivotal role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice revealed that phenotypic GABAB receptors on these neurons are responsible for sleep-wake states. When the GABAA receptor is activated, it induces responses that promote sleep, while its inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and induced sleep. The findings suggest that the genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans may be linked to sleep regulation, and alterations in this receptor could disrupt sleep patterns. The sociocultural implications of this discovery are profound, highlighting the potential for inherited phenotypes to regulate sleep and the subsequent impact on daily life.",
            "Digging into Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), I found myself navigating three main areas: first, understanding the disorder itself; second, the process of diagnosis; and third, what teachers in a mainstreamed classroom can do to support students with CAPD.\n\n CAPD, or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is basically about the brain's ability to process what we hear. It's not about hearing loss, but rather the brain's challenge in deciphering, separating, and making sense of sound. People with CAPD can hear just fine, but their brain's internal messaging system, the central nervous system (CNS), can't quite keep up. They might pick up on individual sounds, but struggle to distinguish between different voices, conversations, or background noise.\n\nI stumbled upon the term \"auditory imperception\" in the 1950s, when researchers first identified it as a potential issue in kids with communication disorders. Since then, tests have been developed to help diagnose and understand CAPD. Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari started testing kids in 1954, and by 1961, Kimura introduced a new way of evaluating CAPD through dichotic testing. This sparked a wave of research, culminating in a national conference in 1977.\n\nCAPD presents itself in various ways. For some, it's difficulty pinpointing where sounds are coming from or distinguishing between multiple sounds. Others might struggle to recognize patterns or detect changes in speech, such as sarcasm. They might also get interrupted by one sound blocking another or struggle to piece together sound clues to make sense of them. Then there's the challenge of following the sequence of sounds.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD requires a thorough evaluation, often involving observation and tests administered by experts like audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and others. This might include questionnaires, surveys, and observing how the person responds to different sounds. There's no single, magic test that gets it right every time, and sadly, we still don't know what causes CAPD. Tests often involve presenting multiple sounds simultaneously and asking the individual to pick out specific items, like words or numbers. Some more advanced tests record sound waves within the ear and measure the brain's response.",
            "The play Twelfth Night suggests that donning a disguise can be an effective way to deceive others, but ultimately, it's a precarious game that can lead to losing oneself in the process. The problem with dropping a disguise is that it can lead to feelings of alienation, as one must then confront the consequences of their deception. This raises a difficult question: is it better to prioritize one's own self-preservation or the preservation of relationships with those around them? While some people might respond with indifference to being tricked, others may not take kindly to the deception, and their reaction can be anything but pleasant.\n\nThe idea of deception through gender role reversal is particularly complex, as it brings up a multitude of questions. One of the most pressing ones is, what drives someone to hide their true identity and adopt a disguise of the opposite sex? In the case of Viola, her decision is a desperate attempt to protect herself from harm: \"I'll take you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249). As a foreigner in a new land, Viola feels compelled to disguise herself as a man to avoid becoming a target. However, this ruse ultimately isolates her from the women around her, depriving her of a vital support system.\n\nViola's disguise is so convincing that Olivia becomes smitten with her, mistaking her for Sebastian: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138). Furthermore, Viola is forced to navigate her own suppressed desires for Orsino: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1.260-261). While this might seem like a progressive attitude to some, Twelfth Night can also be seen as a portrayal of how deception can facilitate the revelation of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages suggest that these characters may have unexpressed desires that are brought to the surface by Viola's disguise. For instance, is Olivia drawn to Cesario because of his masculine appearance, or does she secretly harbor feelings for women? Although it's unlikely that Olivia is genuinely attracted to women, her character can be seen as a satire of those who judge others based on appearance alone.\n\nThis is evident in the ease with which Olivia shifts her affections from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a romantic interest: \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315)",
            "The brutal nature of German colonial rule has been a subject of much discussion, particularly with regards to the atrocities committed against the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa.  But let's not get too hasty – the German colonial empire was a multifaceted beast with an array of policies and ruling styles as diverse as its geography. Educational provision across the colonies was equally varied, reflecting the complexities of this complex system. When the British took over German East Africa (now Tanganyika) in 1919, they encountered a surprisingly large population of educated and literate Africans, a stark contrast to the story of German colonial efforts elsewhere.\n\nIn particular, the situation in South West Africa – present-day Namibia – stands out as a jarring exception. Unlike East Africa, where the government took an active role in educating the native population, in South West Africa this responsibility fell largely to missionary societies, which received meager support from the government. Meanwhile, the government lavished significant resources on the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing a system of state schools and heavily subsidizing and regulating missionary schools. The effects of these policies persisted long after German rule had ended, leaving a lasting impact on South West Africa. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, here the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\n\nSo what explains this divergent experience of South West Africa? A range of social, economic, and political factors played a role, and I aim to shed more light on these in this paper. I'll focus particularly on fresh research into the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans, a topic that's been under-explored.\n\nThere's no shortage of literature on education in the German colonial empire, with much of it written in German during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. These early works tend to focus on describing the features of educational systems in the various colonies. Later studies, written in English, took a more comparative approach, examining education in the different German colonies and delving deeper into specific aspects of education. These studies revealed significant disparities in the educational systems of different colonies, with each one having its own unique flavor. One of the most influential works on this topic is Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies, highlighting the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa was a major factor in shaping the colony's educational system.\n\nThe German colonial territories in Africa presented a stark contrast in terms of climate, with South West Africa boasting a relatively mild climate, albeit with large expanses of arid desert. This relatively hospitable environment drew a significant number of European settlers – by 1913, nearly 15,000 whites called South West Africa home, compared to just 5,336 in East Africa, which had the next largest settler population.",
            "Over the last century, the landscape of popular music has undergone a seismic shift, branching into an array of genres that's become increasingly difficult to catalog. To make matters more complex, most, if not all, genres - think rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, and the like - have spawned a multitude of sub and sub-sub genres, each with its own distinct flavor. One genre that stands out as particularly diverse and expressive is Heavy Metal, which has evolved dramatically over the past 40 years to encompass a kaleidoscope of emotions, predominantly leaning towards the darker end of the emotional spectrum.\n\nHeavy Metal's flexibility has always been its defining trait, allowing artists to experiment and create their own sub-genres, which in turn have spawned an array of sub-sub-genres. As a result, the genre has become so diverse that it's challenging to pinpoint exactly what Heavy Metal is. It's a genre that has incorporated elements from other styles, yet its roots can be traced back to a singular movement.\n\nAt its core, Heavy Metal is a movement defined by its affinity for the darker aspects of life. It's a music of excess - more bass, more volume, more aggression, and more theatrics. Heavy Metal musicians are known for their technical prowess, evident in the complexity of their playing. Additionally, the genre has a long history of being closely tied to substance abuse, particularly in the 1970s, when a psychedelic drug boom led to the creation of unconventional, otherworldly music. The genre's visceral qualities, which often explored the darker side of the emotional spectrum, were a refreshing departure from the more lighthearted popular music of the time. Later generations of metal artists drew inspiration from the Romantic Era's dark, intense qualities, reflecting the genre's ongoing exploration of the human experience.\n\nLyrics like those found in Helter Skelter, a song often cited as one of the first Heavy Metal songs, exemplify the genre's affinity for the darker side of human nature. This song, penned by John Lennon, is a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier, darker sound, showcasing the Beatles' ability to create music that's just as intense. It's a testament to the genre's willingness to push boundaries and challenge conventions.",
            "Before the Surrealist artists set brush to canvas, painting their dreamlike masterpieces, the talented Henri Rousseau was crafting his own visions, quite literally. His 1910 work, The Dream, is a painting that's more than just a woman's enchantment with the wonders of a fantastical land - it's also a reflection of Rousseau's own dreams and aspirations as an artist. For years, he yearned for recognition, acceptance, and praise from his peers and art enthusiasts alike, but this desire came with a daunting challenge: should he conform to the art world's expectations or forge his own path and risk being unconventional?\n\nTo truly grasp the significance of The Dream, one needs to delve into Rousseau's remarkable life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in the French town of Laval, Rousseau's father was a prosperous businessman who enjoyed a comfortable lifestyle. Despite his comfortable upbringing, Rousseau himself received no formal art training, instead working as an employee of the municipal toll service until he was forty. He earned the nickname douanier, or customs inspector, but this moniker didn't capture the full extent of his talents. The loss of his first wife and eight infant children left Rousseau with only one child and a deep sense of sorrow, which he attempted to alleviate through painting. Unlike his contemporaries, who often romanticized the peasant in their art, Rousseau was a folk painter, driven by the hopes and dreams of the ordinary man.\n\nRousseau's obsession with being accepted by the art world was understandable, especially considering his late start and lack of formal training. He was producing art alongside some of the most talented and renowned modern artists of his time. It wasn't until around the same period that Matisse began building his reputation as an artist that Rousseau finally received the recognition he so desperately sought. Author Jan Gordon aptly pointed out the contrast between the two artists, noting that while Matisse aimed to avoid triteness in his work, Rousseau's goal was to create something so conventional that it would earn him acceptance into the Artiste Français.",
            "It's no secret that philosophers have long been fascinated by the intricate connection between ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. I firmly believe that there's a reason for this profound link. As John Keats beautifully puts it in his iconic poem \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty – That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Our understanding of the world is largely shaped by education and experience, but our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics seems to transcend these conventional paths. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe, rather than dictate. Our studies of morality and beauty are efforts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful or why an action is moral, rather than providing a set of rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nIn essence, criticism of art or morals can never fully capture the essence of what's great or beautiful. Analyzing the value of the Mona Lisa, for instance, might delve into aspects like composition, contrast, or cultural context, but these don't encapsulate why it's considered a masterpiece. When people discuss their favorite work of art or literature, they often start with a phrase like, \"There's just something about it,\" followed by a more in-depth explanation. I believe that both art and morals can't be reduced to a description of their qualities alone. As the inimitable Flannery O'Connor astutely observed, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way...You tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we examine the properties of a work of literature, there's an intangible quality that remains. I'm convinced that ethics shares this same property. As Wittgenstein insightfully notes, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" This \"something\" – this je ne sais quoi – is, in my opinion, the most powerful attribute of art and morality, and it provides a common ground between them.\n\nI believe that morality and art are deeply connected because we experience both at a profoundly personal level, to use a Kantian term. They impact us in ways that can be felt, but not fully explained. This connection is even more pronounced when it comes to literature. As McKean so eloquently puts it, \"What most distinguishes literature from other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values...Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "The Germany we know today is a powerhouse, a unified nation with its own unique cultural identity, spanning from the Alpine shadows of München to the Baltic Sea's shores in Kiel. The cultural thread that weaves through this vast land can be traced from Köln on the Rhine, through the heart of Germany, all the way to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. Given its rich heritage, it's no surprise that modern-day Germany has roots from a tapestry of different sources and tribes.\n\nThe cradle of Germanic culture is known as Germania, but the true origins of its name are shrouded in mystery. Some scholars point to the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe, as the source, while others suggest that the name might have derived from the Gauls' term for their neighbor. I find it fascinating to learn about the various theories surrounding the name's etymology. Julius Caesar's writings on the Gallic Wars offer a glimpse into the early use of the term \"Germanus,\" which he borrowed from the Gauls to distinguish between the conquered and unconquered tribes. In his commentary, Caesar notes, \"The Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they are continually waging war... They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC)\n\nWhile the name's true meaning remains uncertain, some theories propose that it might be related to the spear used in warfare, known as a \"ger,\" or the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" which could imply that the Germans were known for their loud and boisterous nature. The Roman historian Tacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" offers a captivating account of the Germans' origins, describing them as a people untouched by other cultures, with a unique identity that was not shaped by immigration or external influences. According to Tacitus, \"Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\" (Tacitus, 98)\n\nIt's intriguing to consider why the Romans, despite their conquests, never fully settled in Germania. Instead, they traded with the Germanic tribes, who offered their goods and skills in exchange for Roman hospitality. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they lived on the fringes of the Roman Empire, exchanging their wares and expertise for a place within the Roman army's ranks. This complex web of cultural exchange and trade laid the foundation for the Germany we know today, a nation with a rich tapestry of influences and a distinct cultural identity.",
            "As I stood there, my mind went blank, unable to grasp the scene unfolding before me. I stared unemotionally, disconnected from the moment, observing the world around me with a practiced detachment. Thoughts flitted through my mind, only to vanish as quickly as they appeared, leaving me with a sense of disconnection from my own thoughts. My consciousness was a smooth, unbroken flow, like a serene stream, with no distinct thoughts of my own, just a fluid experience of the world around me.\n\nI recall purchasing an art instruction book, 'The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,' after getting advice from a fellow artist. I'd always been fascinated by drawing since I was six, and this book promised to teach me the basics, from understanding the humble pencil to grasping how our brains interpret lines. One technique caught my eye: placing a frame around any picture to simplify its complexity. By doing so, a chaotic scene, like a still life of fruit on a table, could be reduced to a manageable, two-dimensional image.\n\nAt that moment, gazing down at the offending object in front of me, I couldn't mentally impose that frame. I was overwhelmed, awed, and unable to process the situation. If I had any aspirations of being an artist, this was the beginning of my masterpiece, the start of my story, titled 'Work in Brown.'\n\nMy hand instinctively reached for my tool of art, and I felt a surge of creative energy. Water flowed smoothly, crystal clear, and serene. Flakes of matter broke away, carried off into nothingness. But as my hand moved, muscles tensed and spasmed, and my hand struck the toilet handle for the second time. The stubborn, brown, unwanted package refused to budge, stuck like a slug on the toilet bowl.\n\nMop in hand, feet apart, and a green tie strangling my neck, I frowned, staring at the offending bundle left for the unsuspecting janitor at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more moments of introspection, and my hand reached for the toilet paper roll, began to wrap itself in toilet paper until it resembled a makeshift oven mitt. Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, I slowly dipped my hand into the bowl, a slow, deliberate movement like a mother preparing to retrieve the Thanksgiving turkey from the oven.",
            "The alarming statistics on teenage driving fatalities paint a somber picture - a deadly vector that's claiming lives behind the wheel. Several factors contribute to this disturbing trend, but one crucial aspect is the developmental stage of the teen brain, which is simply not equipped to handle the perils of driving. Inexperience is another major factor, not only leading to tragic accidents but also higher rates of rollover crashes, speeding, and driving off the road.\n\nThe teenage tendency to drive with peers is a recipe for disaster, and studies have consistently shown a correlation between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents. California and other states have tried to mitigate this issue by introducing temporary provisional licenses that restrict the number of hours teens can drive and prohibit minors as passengers. However, these measures are, in my opinion, mere Band-Aids on a festering wound.\n\nThe real issue lies in the fact that, statistically speaking, young drivers are not capable of adequately handling the risks and responsibilities associated with driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman has conducted research suggesting that even 18 is too young for a full driver's license, citing a common desire among those under 19-20 to engage in thrill-seeking behavior. It's logical, then, to delay driving until this tendency has subsided. If we continue to issue licenses to young teens, we risk seeing a devastating spike in fatalities, with potentially disastrous consequences by 2010 when the Baby Boomer generation's children will be hitting the roads.\n\nA relatively straightforward legislative solution exists. Schools could continue to offer driver's education classes to initiate the learning process, but no one under 18 should be allowed to operate a vehicle. A provisional permit could still be granted before a full license is issued, accompanied by a set number of practical training hours. The hours required could be based on existing state regulations, such as California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult. Uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable and effective means of protecting young drivers across the nation.\n\nThis proposal is not a novel idea, but it's a necessary step towards mitigating the staggering statistics on teenage driving fatalities.",
            "Browsing through the Library of Congress's archives of early Edison films, I stumbled upon a trove of trick films from 1895 to 1901, a total of fifteen mind-bending masterpieces. These films playfully exploit creative editing to create illusions that deceive and delight. My film study delved into the poetic elements that make trick films tick and analyzed the innovative leaps forward in a few of the later ones. At the turn of the century, trick films typically played out within the confines of a set-bound, frontal proscenium, featuring static cameras and sticking to a strict one-shot-per-film rule. However, as the century progressed, some filmmakers began to break free from these constraints by introducing novel techniques like multiple shots.\n\nOne striking commonality among trick films is their tendency to be set within the confines of a single interior scene, framed by a frontal proscenium. The camera remains steadfast in its position, refusing to follow figures or objects as they move. This composition, a staple of early cinema, drew its roots from the world of theatre and the vaudeville and magic acts that inspired it. The limitations of the stage-based setup resulted in figures moving horizontally within the frame, never venturing closer or further away from the lens. Take, for instance, the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where the actors enter from the right, moving back and forth along the horizontal axis, never straying beyond the camera's fixed frame.\n\nThe use of the frontal proscenium also led to a preponderance of long shots and, occasionally, medium shots, with close-ups being a rare sight. This adherence to traditional theatre and vaudeville conventions meant that the audience would see the entire performance at a given time, framed by the borders of the stage. In early films, actors rarely moved towards or away from the camera, making close-ups a non-existent phenomenon. Most trick films from the Edison catalog conform to the one-conceptual-shot-equals-one-film rule, restricting their length to approximately a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. This also limited the narrative and dramatic potential of these films, which generally focused on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic and disappearing acts, with little story to speak of. However, upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that one conceptual shot can be comprised of multiple physical shots, cleverly joined together to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance. The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) is a prime example, where a thorough examination reveals the precise moment where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the film is conceptually one shot in the viewer's eyes.",
            "I've always been intrigued by the story of John Taylor of Caroline, a man who embodied the spirit of Republicanism in its early days. As an agriculturalist by profession, his passion for the land and the values it represented shaped his views on personal freedom and government. His strong convictions on preserving the agrarian system underpinned his arguments on sovereignty, the Constitution, and the judicial system, often making him a vocal advocate for limited government and individual rights.\n\nTaylor believed that the United States had a unique opportunity to create a truly exceptional system of government, free from the constraints of traditional institutions. He was convinced that the declaration of natural rights, which he saw as interconnected and mutually dependent, should be beyond the reach of government. In his view, a government should acknowledge and balance the inherent duality of human nature, with its virtues and vices. He famously argued that, as government is exercised by humans, all its virtues and vices must be human as well.\n\nTo create an ideal society, Taylor proposed a government that would protect private property, promote agriculture, and discourage unchecked capitalism. He saw a well-founded government as one that would function equitably, despite the inevitable presence of self-interest and avarice in its administration. He believed that self-interest was a fundamental human drive, but it only became a problem when it led to the exploitation of others. A good government, he thought, was necessary to contain humanity's darker aspects and prevent the spread of bad principles.\n\nAs a staunch Republican, Taylor championed a strict construction of the Constitution, advocating for a limited federal government with only explicitly stated powers. He recognized that an expansive federal government was likely to be costly and tyrannical, yet he cautioned against a simplistic, literal interpretation of the Constitution, which could lead to corruption. For Taylor, the Declaration of Independence served as the true charter of the United States, providing a clearer vision of the country as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Looking back at Figure 17, I noticed a sudden and alarming drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. It was a bit disheartening and left me wondering what could have caused it. As the winter months rolled in at our New England campus, it's not a stretch to assume that the decrease in foot and bike traffic contributed to the decline. The end of the fall semester in December also brought a flurry of activity - students were finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and were probably too busy to bother with logging their commutes. The holiday season and subsequent month-long break didn't help, either - many students and faculty were on vacation, and the campus was eerily quiet. It wasn't until late January, with the start of the spring semester, that things picked up again, but even that didn't explain the low numbers for February. We had hypothesized that our project might experience a natural ebb in enthusiasm after the initial excitement wore off, and the Carpool Challenge Week campaign we launched in March was designed to combat this by injecting a burst of energy and enthusiasm. It worked, at least temporarily, as log submissions increased during that month. However, the bigger challenge we faced was how to maintain momentum amidst the natural fluctuations in engagement caused by semester breaks and holidays.\n\nAnother hurdle we encountered was the deeply ingrained cultural preference for driving one's own car. People love their independence and flexibility, and it's no wonder many were hesitant to give up their keys. To combat this, we tried offering prizes - gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, and bookstores - but it would have been interesting to see how bigger, more enticing prizes would have affected participation. For instance, giving away a brand new bike, hybrid car, or electric car might have been just the thing to boost engagement and combat that initial decline. We stuck with the same prize structure throughout the project, but if we had gradually increased the value of the prizes - announcing bigger and better prizes each month - it might have helped keep people engaged and motivated.",
            "I've recently found myself pondering the mystique of ETFs, or exchange-traded funds, and the benefits that come with them. Essentially, an ETF is a security that mirrors an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets, much like an index fund. But unlike its more rigid counterpart, an ETF offers flexibility and trades on an exchange like a stock, giving you the best of both worlds. On one hand, an ETF provides the diversification of an index fund and the perks of single stock ownership, such as the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and even purchase a single share in a transaction. However, these benefits come with a catch – the expense ratios of ETFs tend to be significantly lower than those of the average mutual fund.\n\nWhile ETFs may seem like the holy grail of investing, there are some downsides to consider. For instance, you'll need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just like you would on a stock order. Not to mention the overwhelming array of funds available, which can make it challenging to determine whether the benefits you're promised actually pan out. As a savvy investor, it's essential to scrutinize the benefits, such as diversification, and evaluate their true extent. In this investigation, we'll be taking a closer look at the ETF IHF and comparing it to its top 10 holdings to see if the benefits of owning a single ETF come close to replicating the benefits of a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks.\n\nTo simplify our analysis, we'll focus on the top 10 holdings, which account for a substantial 63.58% of the ETF's assets. By examining these holdings, we can gain a better understanding of how well they represent the ETF as a whole. To do this, we can calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming a portfolio composed entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportions established by the ETF. The results of these calculations are presented in the chart below.\n\nA quick glance at the chart reveals that a portfolio consisting only of the top 10 holdings would yield a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Moreover, the Beta of the top 10 holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF as a whole, suggesting that this portfolio may offer a higher return with a lower risk. However, it's essential to note that these results may not be statistically significant, and further analysis is needed to confirm our findings.\n\nTo determine whether these portfolios are statistically distinct, we'll examine the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100% for comparison with the ETF IHF's accumulated standard deviation. This will give us a better understanding of the level of risk associated with each portfolio and help us determine whether the differences we've observed are statistically meaningful.",
            "In the realm of Edgar Allan Poe's literary masterpieces, \"Dream-Land\" stands out as one of his personal favorites. This poem is a testament to Poe's fascination with the concept of Thulé, which he references twice in the work. Interestingly, the term \"Thulé\" was first introduced by the ancient Greek poet Virgil, who used it to describe an island located beyond the edge of the known world. However, there's another source that deserves recognition - Poe's affinity for German authors. Poe's admiration for the works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe is well-documented, and it's likely that he drew inspiration from Goethe's writing.\n\nThe connection between Poe and Goethe is significant, as it highlights their shared themes and ideas. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" notes the striking similarities between their works, suggesting that Poe may have been influenced by Goethe's poetry. The Oxford Companion to English Literature sheds more light on Goethe's works, including his celebrated poetic drama \"Faust,\" which was published in two parts in 1808 and 1832, respectively. Within the second part of \"Faust,\" there's a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé,\" which tells the story of a king who, after losing his wife, succumbs to grief and eventually dies.\n\nThe parallels between the King of Thulé and the narrator in \"Dream-Land\" are striking, with both characters grappling with loss and despair. Poe's use of Thulé as a recurring theme in his works, including \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" suggests a deeper exploration of the human experience. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe describes Thulé as a desolate and colorless world, haunted by the memories of the past. This eerie landscape echoes the King of Thulé's own desolate existence, as he mourns the loss of his beloved wife.\n\nGoethe's influence on Poe's work is further solidified by their shared connections to other notable authors, such as Alfred, Lord Tennyson. Poe's admiration for Tennyson is well-documented, and it's likely that he was exposed to Goethe's works through various reproductions and translations that were widely available after the original publication. The relationship between Poe and Goethe serves as a testament to the cross-pollination of ideas and influences that shaped the literary landscape of the 19th century.",
            "Can a customer who slipped and fell on an applesauce spill in a grocery store in California potentially win punitive damages if the store manager ignored two warnings to clean the spill and didn't act for half an hour because he was eating dinner?  It's likely that a judge won't dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim out of hand. To justify punitive damages, a plaintiff must show that the defendant's actions were a reckless disregard for the harm they could cause, and were truly despicable. Palmer can argue that the store manager, Martin, should have known the spill was a hazard because six people had slipped and fallen in the store in the months leading up to her accident, and still he didn't act. That's a pretty weak argument, but it's not entirely implausible given that Martin was informed about the spill twice, and still chose to ignore it while he had dinner.\n\nThe details of the case are pretty disturbing. On October 13th, an employee, Rich Wayne, told Martin about the spill at 5:00 pm, but Martin said he was too busy to deal with it. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary Haddigan, also warned Martin about the spill, but he still blew her off. It wasn't until 5:30 pm, when Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, that someone finally took action. It's not just this incident that suggests Martin didn't care about safety – five other people had slipped and fallen in the store in the same year. Palmer is now suing D&D for the injuries she sustained, and we're considering whether to ask the court to dismiss the claim for punitive damages.\n\nIn California, punitive damages are only available if a defendant has acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" The law defines malice as conduct that's meant to cause harm, or if not, conduct that's so despicable it shows a willful disregard for the rights and safety of others. A court has ruled that conduct is malicious if it shows a conscious disregard for the plaintiff's rights, especially when the defendant knows the harm that's likely to result from their actions. In this case, it seems like Martin knew the probable consequences of leaving the spill uncleaned, but chose to ignore them. That's not exactly the kind of behavior you'd expect from a store manager.",
            "It's been just shy of four years since I enrolled in a course on Islam at CBC. One question that consistently sparked heated debates in class was whether Islam is, in fact, a hostile religion. I think this topic has taken on even greater relevance in the years following 9/11. In retrospect, I've observed a shift in the way mass media portrays Islam, veering from an overwhelmingly negative stance to an extreme show of tolerance towards the faith in America. It's astonishing to consider that, in 2001, a presidential candidate with an obvious Muslim background, such as Barack Obama, would have been unimaginable.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad has piqued my interest due to the apparent disconnect between his historical persona and the character depicted in the biography. From what I've learned, I always thought Muhammad forced conversions to Islam, conquering tribes and imposing the faith upon them. However, the biography paints a very different picture of Muhammad, portraying him as a misunderstood martyr who humbled himself to others and patiently waited for people to seek him out after witnessing the \"truth\" in his teachings.\n\nWhat's striking to me is the uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the reported \"miracles\" of Muhammad. One notable example is the story of Muhammad multiplying mutton and milk to feed a group of forty men. The writing style used in these accounts makes me believe the authors were attempting to portray Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove anything, simply living in truth and experiencing miracles. This downplays the significance of Jesus' life and miracles, making it seem as though the authors are attempting to co-opt and profit from Jesus' legacy through Muhammad.\n\nFurthermore, many stories in the biography seem to be included to provide \"proof\" of the \"witness\" or the spontaneous conversion of people to Islam. However, I found this approach problematic, as a lot of these stories come from third-party accounts, often through a series of hearsay. This diminishes the stories and makes them seem even more suspicious.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this work is the attempted deification of Muhammad as a gentle, humble, wise, and endearing figure. Yet, historical records contradict this image, and I can't help but wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true history behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "As we look back at the foundation of Christianity, it's striking to see how quickly the teachings of Jesus were set aside in favor of the evolving ideas that shaped the faith after his time.  Taking a broad view of history, it becomes clear that Christianity has been gradually moving further and further away from its roots.  Yet, there's a growing sense of awareness and a progressive shift in today's world, which may signal a turning point.  While traditionalists will likely resist exploring beyond the established norms, their influence may wane as a more open-minded segment of the population gains traction.  In the years to come, Christians will increasingly seek a deeper understanding of their faith, distinguishing between the original intent of Jesus' message and the doctrines that have accumulated over time.  It's a process that may take centuries, but eventually, it's inevitable:  The trend of Christian history will reverse, and the faith will return to its original form.  A movement will emerge, peeling away the layers of dogma, layer by layer, as if the clock were rewinding, leaving only the essence of Jesus' teachings that he brought to humanity through God, untainted by the influences of later thinkers.  As this shift gains momentum in the United States and Europe, masses will be inspired to worship in a more authentic, unadulterated way, as if they were living in Jesus' time, following his ideas alone.  The church, as an institution, will remain a guiding force, but its teachings will become more uniform and less diverse, as differences between regions, denominations, and factions begin to fade.  History is replete with examples of reversals, like the transformation of the Roman Empire from a persecutor of Christians to a Christian institution, or the transition from African-American slavery to leadership.  The next great reversal will unfold within Christianity, a journey back to the source, where diversity is lost in the process.  A crucial aspect of this process will be to interpret Jesus' words as metaphors rather than literal statements.  So, let's examine the roots of Christianity:  If we dig deep into history, we find Judaism, the theological wellspring of the Christian faith.  By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were already central to Jewish thought.  Yet, the Jewish people were far from united, splintering into groups like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and ordinary folk.",
            "I believe that Upton Sinclair's The Jungle reveals the inherent self-interest and narcissism that lies within human nature. People are primarily driven by their own desires to improve their lives, without much concern for those around them. The novel masterfully illustrates this concept in various ways. The greedy factory owners and managers are the most obvious example. Their sole ambition is to expand their businesses and accumulate wealth, without regard for the consequences or any obstacles that may come their way. They carelessly disregard the harm caused by pollution, as evident in Sinclair's vivid description of the factories' pollution: \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". This potent imagery conveys the devastating impact of their actions on the environment and the people living nearby, who are exposed to the noxious fumes and unsanitary conditions of the factories.\n\nThe owners' disregard for their employees is equally appalling. They prioritize profits over people, as Sinclair notes, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They exploit their workers, forcing them to work long hours with little notice and zero compensation, and then cast them aside without a second thought when they're no longer needed. During the time period in which the novel is set, workers had little to no protection under the law, allowing the factory owners to run amok, pushing their employees to work faster and under harsh conditions. The novel implies that the workers were expected to accept these conditions without complaint, as there were no organizations or resources available to support them. Even the unions formed to represent the workers often ended up harming them more than helping, profiting off the misery of the poor. The workers were essentially treated as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "When weaving a narrative, authors often employ techniques to evoke a specific emotional response from their readers. Some methods prove more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald masterfully employs a variety of techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. He frequently pairs adjectives with nouns in unconventional ways to create an aura around a subject. At other times, he imbues a symbol with meaning, only to reuse it to convey a similar sentiment. Fitzgerald employs the latter technique with several colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, he builds associations for the colors white/gray, then later uses these connections to evoke a particular feeling in the reader when describing a significant object.\n\nFitzgerald skillfully constructs meaning for the colors white/gray, with white being associated with a more refined and upper-class tone, while gray is linked to something older and faded. He establishes this meaning early on in the novel by consistently using both colors. The characters of Daisy and Jordan are often \"in white\" (8), and, in fact, white is a ubiquitous color: Nick dons \"white flannels\" (41) to Gatsby's party, while Tom sports a \"white shirt\" (36) when he meets Myrtle. Catherine is even described as \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only exception to this is when Nick is describing his impressions of Gatsby's party: \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further reinforces these color associations by applying them to everyday, unremarkable subjects: when Nick commutes to work, he navigates \"the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the names of people at Gatsby's parties are now \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's schedule, and Catherine's apartment is likened to \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\" – a sense of uniformity (28). He also uses white or gray to describe ordinary people or places: Jordan and Daisy shared a \"white girlhood\" (19), there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" in the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nAfter establishing a strong connection between white/gray and uniformity/unimportance, Fitzgerald employs this color symbolism to convey a similar message about certain subjects. This begins with Daisy. Following a period of minimal use of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster\" (74), and readers start to perceive her as more of a uniform, almost interchangeable element, something Gatsby desires and longs for. Fitzgerald uses this technique repeatedly around Daisy to reinforce the idea that she is a more uniform addition, as seen in the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18) and her appearance in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County is the perfect place for a thriving agricultural operation, thanks to its incredibly mild and sunny climate. The region's rich soil and favorable weather conditions make it an ideal location for growing a diverse array of crops, including juicy tomatoes, succulent citrus fruits, leafy greens, squashes, broccoli, fragrant herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, luscious berries, sweet honey, and spicy peppers. With a growing demand for organic community-supported agriculture (CSA) programs, local farmers have a lucrative market to tap into, and many have lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also highly sought after, and innovative farmers are capitalizing on this trend. \n\nIn addition to the financial benefits, organic farming has a profound impact on the environment. By avoiding harsh chemicals, these farms become wildlife sanctuaries, boasting vibrant biodiversity and a healthier ecosystem. However, there are some trade-offs to consider. Organic farming requires more labor and management to maintain the soil and water quality without relying on chemicals, which can lead to higher costs and potential losses. Small organic farms also struggle with efficiency, lacking the scale of large industrial operations. To mitigate these challenges, landowners may seek financial assistance or expert guidance to maximize both profits and habitat quality.\n\nFor this hypothetical scenario, I've chosen a 160-acre property in unincorporated San Diego County, near the town of Potrero. This land is a unique blend of chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, situated next to the Cleveland National Forest. It falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which aims to protect over 100 species of plants and animals. Unfortunately, many of these species are endangered or declining, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher.\n\nThis land has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. The property was part of an original homestead patent, which likely meant it was used for grazing and/or wood production for many decades.\n\nTo better understand the possibilities and challenges of farming this land, I selected a real estate listing and researched government programs that could help mitigate costs and preserve wildlife-friendly operations. As a model for a small farmer in this area, I looked at an existing organic farm in the same region, striving to balance the needs of both people and the planet.",
            "The intricate dance of culture plays a pivotal role in any negotiation. But what exactly is culture? It's a complex entity that can be defined by what it's not as much as what it is, and what it signifies. Culture is not monolithic, nor is it a single, uniform thing. Reducing it to broad generalizations, such as \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating,\" can be misleading and overly simplistic. While understanding a culture's general characteristics can be helpful, it's far more productive to grasp the significance of that culture in the context of the negotiation and how it will shape the discussion. When navigating a foreign culture, we inevitably compare it to our own, and this can lead to a deeper understanding.\n\nDelving into a foreign culture or mindset requires a willingness to study its history, acknowledge its biases, and accept it for what it is. Rather than trying to change or judge a culture, it's essential to work within its boundaries, especially during negotiations, particularly when you're in a weaker bargaining position. When operating on \"away\" territory, respecting local traditions and beliefs can help break down cultural barriers and facilitate progress in the negotiation.\n\nCulture's scope extends beyond national or international boundaries. Companies within a country often establish their own distinct corporate culture, which can vary greatly. For instance, some companies value long working hours, while others prioritize a more relaxed schedule. This corporate culture is reflected in employee attire, communication styles, delegation of tasks, and hiring practices. Even within the United States, corporate culture differs significantly from company to company, and within companies, there's diversity from region to region and city to city.\n\nValues are crucial to grasp, as they provide the underlying motivations behind a culture. If saving face or maintaining communal harmony is a core value, a negotiator won't risk publicly embarrassing their company or superior. Conversely, a negotiator from a culture prioritizing hard-driven deals won't necessarily be eager to settle quickly. Considering these generalities is vital before sitting at the negotiation table, but it's also essential to learn about your opponent on a personal level to make the negotiation effective.",
            "A phrase often attributed to the Bible, \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God,'\" initially appears in Psalm 14, and it's also central to St. Anselm's argument on the existence of God. Thomas Aquinas shares a similar conviction. Since their arguments both defend the same concept, and our task is to determine which one is more compelling, we'll assume, for the sake of keeping things concise, that they're both correct in their faith in the God of the Bible. If we were to allow for a different conception of God, it would distort the comparison between their two arguments, as they're essentially in defense of a specific deity. \n\nLet's cut to the chase: both St. Anselm and St. Thomas Aquinas present valid points, but neither provides a comprehensive foundation for believing in God. To illustrate this point, let's dive into the core of St. Anselm's argument. In his writing, Anselm embarks on a journey of discovery through faith, seeking proof of God within one's own self. He posits that because we can't fully grasp the concept of God's nonexistence, it implies that God must exist within our understanding. While his explanation can be a bit convoluted, his basic idea is that the proof for God lies within our own minds. Anselm suggests that we don't need to look beyond our own souls for truth about God; instead, the existence of this being is self-evident. In essence, he's saying that we can't dismiss the notion of God without evidence, as it's a fundamental aspect of our inner selves. This concept of trusting in the unproven is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\nOn the other hand, St. Thomas Aquinas takes a more empirical approach. He proposes that the existence of God can be proven using reason and evidence, eliminating the need for faith altogether. This idea would be beneficial for Christian evangelism, as it would allow new converts to be won over by logic rather than by blind faith. Aquinas develops five distinct logical arguments in support of God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Through each, he demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the inherent logic of his existence. If you're told you're missing a puzzle piece, assembling the rest of the puzzle reveals the features and existence of the missing piece without needing to see it in person.",
            "About 2,500 years ago, a young prince who would eventually be known as the Buddha was born. As his life unfolded, he chose a path that led him away from the world and into enlightenment. His teachings then gave rise to Buddhism, the foundation of which is Theravada Buddhism, the most traditional of its kind. Over time, Buddhism has evolved, transforming in both its surface-level practices and its core principles. This evolution is evident in countries like Sri Lanka, where the Theravada community observes the water-cutting ceremony. This annual event, which has acquired significant spiritual meaning, was never explicitly mentioned by the Buddha. Differences like this permeate Buddhism, extending from its external rituals to its fundamental teachings. Both within the monasteries and outside, the Theravada community has had to adapt its doctrine to changing circumstances. This has been influenced by a mix of both internal and external forces, some of which are benevolent, while others are hostile.\n\nBefore we dive deeper, let's clarify some key terms. Throughout this discussion, we'll refer to internal forces as those originating from within the Buddhist community, regardless of the individual's monastic status. External forces, on the other hand, come from outside the community. A hostile force is one that seeks to harm or undermine Buddhism, while a benign force is one that does not intend to cause harm but may inadvertently do so. These definitions will be crucial as we explore the complexities of Theravada Buddhism.\n\nTo better understand the core of this ancient faith, let's examine its fundamental principles. Buddhists seek refuge in the three jewels of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is comprised of the Tripitaka – the three baskets of sacred texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. These concepts include Anatta (no eternal self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these principles is key to escaping the cycle of death and rebirth, known as Sansara, and ultimately breaking free from the bonds of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka provides a set of guidelines for living, including the five precepts for laypeople (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not engage in immoral behavior, and I shall not consume intoxicating substances). Monks, on the other hand, must adhere to a more extensive set of rules. At the heart of Buddhism lies the four noble truths: Dukkha (life is suffering), the root cause of suffering is attachment, and suffering can be overcome.",
            "It's hard to believe it's been over a century and a half since the United States and Mexico were locked in an epic rivalry that lasted for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893.  The turning point of this longstanding feud was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the US came out on top, claiming Texas and the American Southwest as its own.  The conflict was a series of back-and-forth battles that didn't subside until just before World War I.\n\nAt the heart of this rivalry were deep-seated differences over faith, culture, and tradition.  As David M. Pletcher pointed out, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting American diplomatic headaches\" (1977, p. 41).  Our southern neighbors may have been the only two countries to consistently give the US a hard time, thanks to their proximity and the complex history between our nations.  In fact, other Latin American countries have generally enjoyed a more harmonious relationship with the US.\n\nThe issue of religion played a significant role in the rift between the US and Mexico, much like it has throughout history.  As Sally Frahm noted, \"If Americans opposed fascism and communism in the 20th century, they opposed Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries\" (2001, p. 86).  This wasn't just about differing ideologies; it was also about competing interests, with the two nations vying for what each deemed essential.  We inherited a legacy of distrust from our colonial past, and that made it tough to establish a smooth relationship between the US and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) counted no fewer than 17 disputes between the two nations during the 57-year rivalry period.  Most of these disputes revolved around territorial issues, including cross-border raids and frontier problems.  Border towns were plagued by bandits and outlaws, and it wasn't until both countries took a firmer stance on their borders that these problems started to subside.\n\nAs Schmitt (1974) explained, the rivalry slowly dissipated as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the US, and the US's goals shifted from expansion to economic intervention in Mexico.  And that's when the rivalry finally began to fade away.",
            "It's been fifteen years since my life took an unexpected turn due to an illness I had never heard of before. I was a nurse at the time, but it wasn't a career I had always dreamed of. Growing up, I was driven by the need for security and stability, hearing phrases like \"You'll always find work; people will always get sick\" echoing in my mind. So, I put aside aspirations of being a scientist or journalist to pursue a safer path. \n\nNow, at 46, I'm single, with little savings and unable to work, relying on Social Security Disability for survival. That's the reality I've faced for over a decade, with each passing day being a struggle to maintain security, safety, and self-respect. The one thing I'm certain of is that without the unwavering support of my family and close friends, I wouldn't be here today. When disaster strikes, it's not about being strong; it's about having people to rely on. \n\nMy point is that life is full of emergencies, big and small, and no matter how prepared we think we are, some challenges are too great to overcome alone. I agree that we need to stop putting all our trust in a faltering government, but I believe Americans should learn to trust and support one another instead of trying to go it alone. \n\nThe idea of rugged individualism, touted by Conservatives, is a myth. It was actually compassion, mutual respect, and sharing resources that helped our ancestors persevere in hard times. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies didn't make it to the coast by relying solely on themselves. \n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I've got a disaster kit stocked with essentials like first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and emergency materials. But while that's crucial, it's equally important to know your neighbors and build a support network. If you have the means, consider starting a small farm or investing in a wood stove, but don't forget the value of community.",
            "The age-old question persists: what drives organisms to evolve in the way they do? Are there underlying forces or constraints that steer the direction of evolutionary change? Despite D'Arcy Thompson's assertion in 1917 that even the simplest organic forms remained a mystery to mathematicize, we're still struggling to define them today. In recent years, researchers have begun to harness the power of mathematical modeling to shed light on the intricacies of mollusk skeletogenesis, exploring both ontogeny and phylogeny (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our study delves into how mathematical modeling, combined with experimental studies, can unravel the mechanisms governing the trajectory of evolutionary-developmental change in Prunum.\n\nTo achieve this, we've used X-radiographic images to identify quantifiable parameters that can be fed into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). These parameters have enabled us to create hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies, which we're now using to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. By integrating these results with experimental and descriptive studies, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying forces driving macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nWhen we consider a shell, we can think of it as a tube that navigates through 360 degrees of space over time. The individual coils or whorls of the shell are what give it its unique shape, spiraling around an imaginary central axis known as the columella. The rate at which these whorls expand can vary, and each one is separated by a continuous line called a suture. In most shells, the last whorl, or body whorl, is the largest, while the spire consists of all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire, and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal exits the shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed from various perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural (the latter orientation, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards, is often considered the standard view). A method for counting whorls involves viewing the shell from the apical perspective and identifying the first suture, which serves as a dividing line. Whorls are then counted from this line, with estimates made to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nBy tracing the path of the aperture through space and time, we can chart the trajectory of the shell's growth. This path can be graphically and mathematically represented, allowing us to manipulate the parameters and modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis. By exploring the intricacies of this process, we hope to shed light on the underlying mechanisms driving the evolution of Prunum.",
            "For the past decade, Indonesia has been stuck in a rut when it comes to neonatal and infant mortality rates.  Despite being on track to meet some of the Millennium Development Goals, such as water and sanitation targets, the country's progress in child and maternal health has been woefully inadequate.  The reasons for this stagnation are complex, but they point to a need to overhaul the entire health system rather than just implementing more programs.\n\nOne glimmer of hope is that Indonesia has made some progress in getting skilled healthcare workers to more births.  Now, 72% of births take place with a skilled professional present, which sounds impressive, but it's a mixed bag.  Many of these skilled workers are traditional midwives who lack the training to handle complications during delivery, which is a leading cause of maternal deaths.  In other words, these statistics are somewhat misleading and there's still a lot of work to be done.  Furthermore, there's been a disturbing trend of fewer children under five receiving medical treatment for diarrheal illnesses.  And to make matters worse, data on postnatal care is spotty and reveals a pressing concern, with low rates across the board.\n\nThe country's cesarian-section rates are also a concern, hovering around 4%.  What's even more alarming is that this rate is significantly lower in rural areas, where it's a mere 2%.  This disparity highlights the problem of unequal access to healthcare services, with urban areas getting the lion's share of care.  The issue of access isn't just limited to geographic disparities; there's also a significant gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest households, with a whopping 27% difference.  It's clear that the poor are already at a disadvantage when it comes to accessing healthcare due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nSo, what's the next step towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators?  The question is whether Indonesia should focus on developing program-specific approaches or strengthen its overall health system without prioritizing pre- and post-pregnancy care for mothers and babies.  While programmatic approaches may seem attractive, with their clear objectives and faster results, they come with some significant drawbacks.  One major concern is that investing heavily in one area can divert resources away from other critical areas, leading to a brain drain of human resources and duplication of services.  For instance, the influx of international funding for HIV/AIDS has actually hurt the family planning sector, highlighting the need to think about the broader health system rather than just tackling individual problems in isolation.",
            "Victorian novels are infamous for their meticulous attention to period-specific detail and aristocratic settings. However, two novels that deviate from this norm are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These works seamlessly blend mystery and the bizarre, traits uncommon in the period, thereby enriching their characters and offering profound insights into their motivations and emotions. This departure from the traditional Victorian formula adds depth to the narratives, making them more relatable and engaging.\n\nAs the narrative unfolds, the lines between reality and fantasy become increasingly blurred. In Oliver Twist, for instance, the protagonist's experiences are frequently presented through dreamlike sequences, which serve as a window into his inner world. These visions reveal Oliver's inner turmoil, his emotional pain, and his growing understanding of the harsh realities surrounding him. The infamous shooting scene in chapter 28 is a prime example of this. Oliver's vivid recollection of the event is more akin to a dream than a recollection, highlighting his loss of control over the events unfolding around him. The overwhelming pain and fear he endures are a testament to the dire circumstances he faces, leaving the reader to ponder whose hands are behind his misfortune. This raises questions about Oliver's agency and whether he's capable of controlling his own fate. As his sense of defeat grows, it becomes apparent that the influence of his harsh environment, particularly the manipulative Fagin, has taken its toll, rendering him powerless to act.\n\nIn a similar vein, Wuthering Heights employs dream sequences to explore the complexities of its characters. The passage from Dickens (220) illustrates the disorienting effect of these visions, where the boundaries between reality and fantasy are constantly shifting. The protagonist's perception of time becomes distorted, with days passing in an instant, and nights dragging on interminably. This blurred sense of time serves to heighten the sense of unease and desperation, leaving the reader questioning the nature of reality and the characters' place within it.",
            "‎ It was only a couple of years ago that I found myself in a peculiar situation as an after-school tutor for elementary school students. I was tasked with helping them excel in whatever subject they struggled with, but my strengths lay in English and reading. One student in particular, a boy named Adrian, caught my attention. He was in third or fourth grade, and his reading troubles were quite puzzling. Some letters he could pronounce with ease, while others not at all - it was as if he was speaking a different language. Given his Latino background, I initially assumed he might be struggling with the language barrier, but he spoke perfect English. As I tried to assist him, it dawned on me that something was amiss. That's when his mother walked in, and I realized the truth: Adrian's problem was not with speaking English, but with understanding the English alphabet. We communicated in broken Spanish, with my own limited proficiency, but the moment of clarity hit me like a ton of bricks - the boy could read just fine, but was struggling with the fundamentals of the English language.\n\nI share this story to highlight the often-overlooked issue of the language barrier in schools, particularly in California. It serves as a reminder that the problem is not always as straightforward as we assume. Even for a child who speaks perfect English, reading can be a daunting task. It's an issue that everyone acknowledges, but the real question is: what can we do about it?\n\nAdrian's case was relatively simple to address - he needed additional tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for the many children who barely speak English, the solution is far more complex. No single approach will suffice - not dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutors, or ESL classes alone. Instead, the key lies in combining these methods to create a comprehensive solution.\n\nThe dual language system is an excellent approach not only for children whose first language is Spanish but for all students. Research has shown that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Many people fear that this approach is a waste of resources and that most students won't benefit, but this is a misconception. If implemented as the norm, rather than the exception, all students would benefit from it. So, how can we make this a reality? Do we expect every teacher to be bilingual? No, that's unrealistic and impractical. However, we can have bilingual assistants, tutors, or aides to support students and teachers alike.",
            "We're often told from a young age that there's something greater than us, something we can't fully grasp. While some of us attend Sunday school or temple, others search within themselves for answers. Many accept the faiths passed down by our parents, but some reject them entirely, believing our personal universe is all that exists. We navigate our way to self-discovery through our unique perspectives on spirituality, desperately seeking a guiding light in the darkness. \n\nMy dad and I sat on the porch, listening to the rain, as he gazed into the downpour. His thin frame and sparse hair made him seem almost fragile, and his distant stare made me feel alone. I couldn't bring myself to talk about how much I'd miss him, fearing it would make the reality even more painful for both of us. I hugged him, moved closer, and shared his silence as we watched the rain fall.\n\nMy dad passed away in December, five days after my 22nd birthday, despite the chemo and radiation treatments that prolonged his suffering. I couldn't understand the point of it all. In that dark night, I didn't pray; I'd lost faith in a God who seemed to have stopped listening a long time ago. \n\nI didn't want to witness his final moments, so I avoided it. I chose to remember my dad for the person he was, not the way he left. I knew him better than anyone, and I was certain he wouldn't have wanted me to watch him die.

            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" is often considered a paradox, a blend of the old and the new, as Ian Watt so aptly described it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been simultaneously praised and criticized, accused of lacking depth and yet admired for its ability to evoke the 'terrible sublime' (Burke). At its inception, the \"Gothic Novel\" genre was a fusion of elements from both 'ancient' and 'modern' romances, as Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto so cleverly demonstrated. Walpole's innovative work combined outdated theatrical elements with the modern novel's emphasis on character psychology, creating a unique literary style he dubbed \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre drew heavily from medieval theatre, architecture, and traditions, often incorporating them in unexpected ways. When The Castle of Otranto was first published, the term 'gothic' was already used to describe various styles, periods, and cultures, often with negative connotations – seen as old-fashioned or unsophisticated in comparison to the modern era. The marriage of these contrasting elements is what allowed the Gothic genre to endure and remain both nostalgic and fresh to readers across time.\n\nOne of the key ideas driving the Gothic Novel is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval ideals of knighthood, as exemplified by the process of training a knight, were not only retained but also reinterpreted in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry held significant importance for Gothic writers like Walpole because it represented a timeless ideal: the brave, honorable, and competent knight. Through the use of chivalric themes and language, the 'gothic past' became an idealized and romanticized era, hinting at the future evolution of Gothic into Romanticism. This nostalgia was likely a reflection of Walpole's own experiences during a time of social and political turmoil. As he wrote The Castle of Otranto, he was immersed in the turmoil and likely felt a sense of disillusionment with the present society, perceiving it as lacking the moral values and goodness of the 'gothic era.' This sentiment is evident in characters like Frederic, who embodies the chivalric ideals: he's a prince, a figure of tragedy, and a supposed hero, all of which are conventionally chivalric images. However, Frederic's character also showcases an excessive, exaggerated version of the gallant knight, introducing the trope of excess that would become a hallmark of the Gothic genre (66).",
            "We've all seen the intricate web of the supply chain unfold before our eyes, a complex dance of goods moving from customer demand to raw materials, production, and distribution. The term \"supply chain management\" was first coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who described it as the master plan of planning, implementing, and controlling each step to deliver what customers want, exactly when they want it. At its core, supply chain management is a delicate balancing act - a symphony of processes that require precision and timing to keep the customer satisfied.\n\nThere are six key players in this grand symphony: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Skilled managers use these elements to create a harmonious flow of goods, ensuring that customers receive the best possible service. Each step in the supply chain is crucial, and one misstep can lead to chaos.\n\nProduction is the foundation upon which the entire supply chain is built. It's where the \"when, why, where, and how\" of product creation is decided. Managers must tap into the market to understand customer needs, and once they do, they can decide what products to produce, how many to produce, and where to produce them - all while keeping customer demand and satisfaction in mind. Every detail counts, from production scheduling to equipment maintenance, as even the smallest miscalculation can lead to costly delays or inefficiencies.\n\nFor instance, my own experiences working at retail giants like Wal-Mart and Target taught me the importance of having a clear, step-by-step approach to every aspect of the business. From employee uniforms to receiving shipments, having a solid plan in place helps prevent confusion and ensures a smooth operation.\n\nSupply is the second key element in the supply chain equation. It involves making strategic decisions about a company's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. This might involve deciding which divisions of production best suit which processes, or deciding to outsource work to other companies to achieve velocity - the ability to deliver high-quality products quickly and efficiently, all while keeping costs in check.",
            "The sign above Ellen Page's head reads a haunting truth: Hitler is alive in Burma. The film star stands alone on a street corner, the unsettling message scrawled on her makeshift sign in bold letters. The phrase is a powerful reminder of the struggles unfolding in Myanmar, a Southeast Asian country under the iron grip of a ruthless military junta. The regime seized power in 1962 through a coup d'état, and its authoritarian rule has been marked by brutal suppression of dissent.\n\nIn 2007, a wave of street protests shook the country, earning the name \"The Saffron Revolution\" due to the colorful robes worn by the Burmese monks who led the movement. While the initial protests were peaceful, the government's response escalated into a violent crackdown, with military forces invading and ransacking monasteries across the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned, and a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was tragically killed for simply witnessing a street protest. The official death toll was 13, but Colonel Hla Win, a former army officer, revealed a darker truth: \"Many more people have been killed in recent days than you've heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.\"\n\nThis is not a new phenomenon. Throughout history, governments have sought to maintain control over their citizens, crushing dissent and opposition with an iron fist. The early Roman emperors claimed divine right to rule, while Japanese emperors were believed to be gods, sent to guide their people to prosperity. Even our modern-day leaders have been known to engage in questionable practices, such as President George W. Bush's secret conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of a fringe group with a questionable agenda.\n\nWe see echoes of these tactics in infamous events like the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, where Chinese students and intellectuals were brutally suppressed, with estimated death tolls ranging from 200 to 3,000. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups and the government systematically killed thousands of Tutsis and moderates, is another stark example. And of course, there's the infamous \"Third Reich,\" where Hitler's regime perpetrated one of the most heinous crimes against humanity, targeting Jews and other minority groups.",
            "Duke Ellington’s enduring impact on jazz can be attributed in large part to his remarkable longevity and corresponding ability to shape his orchestra over time. Although his piano presence is subtle in many of the selected compositions, as a composer Ellington excelled at crafting intricate pieces that showcased the unique talents of each band member. He carefully constructed the framework for soloists to improvise within, while also writing tightly orchestrated passages that highlighted the distinctive styles of individual musicians. This approach allowed him to emphasize the overall tone of the orchestra, creating cohesive and original sounds for each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound and how they blended together in the ensemble enabled him to write some of the most groundbreaking and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\n\nA notable example of Ellington’s innovative approach is Creole Love Call, which showcases his use of voice as a jazz instrument throughout his career. This 12-bar blues piece, featuring six choruses, demonstrates Ellington’s ability to complement the styles of his soloists. The song begins with a smooth, melodic voice, gradually transitioning to a rougher sound towards the end. The following choruses feature a muted trumpet solo, a sweeping clarinet solo, and a full-band echo of the first chorus, each emphasizing different elements of the melody. The climactic final chorus features the reeds taking the lead, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections. The return to the first chorus structure in the final section sees the voice adopting the \"growl\" technique, soloing as an instrument. This innovative use of voice as a tone color adds a rich dimension to the piece.\n\nEllington’s use of voice in Creole Love Call is emblematic of a recurring stylistic trait throughout his work. In Hot and Bothered, he combines his skill in tight orchestration with his ear for tone color, achieving a rich and complementary sound through a call and response phrase between Bubber Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing. This approach is further explored in It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing), where Ellington utilizes Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "I'd been plagued by a nagging feeling for as long as I could remember - this maddening need for something that always seemed to elude me. It began when I was 14, at the height of my teenage angst. Three years later, at 17, the yearning was still there, only now it had evolved into a desire for connection, for someone to share my life with. Yet, despite the attention from various suitors, none of them had ever really captured my interest. I spent countless hours grappling with this enigma, trying to pinpoint the source of my unique affliction. Theories abounded, but nothing ever seemed quite right. So I continued to navigate life, forever questioning my desires.\n\nMy days at home were usually a tranquil oasis, a refuge from the world outside. My parents were a picture of serenity, rarely arguing with each other, and even less so with me. They did, however, occasionally clash with my independent streak, which they saw as a desirable but occasionally troublesome trait. I suppose it's no surprise, given their calm nature, that I, on the other hand, was a whirlwind of energy and curiosity, a combination that made me likable and endearing to those around me.\n\nBut today was different. As I wandered from room to room, searching for inspiration, I was jolted by the sound of my mother's anguished cry from the kitchen. I rushed in, panic rising as I asked, \"Mom?! What's wrong?!\" I saw her lying on the floor, writhing in pain, her voice strained as she gasped, \"Ow...sweetie, I...need you to take me to the hospital.\" I rushed to her side, putting a reassuring hand on her shoulder. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to pick you up.\" My mother directed me, her words clipped and urgent, and I could sense the severity of her pain. With my training in self-defense, I scooped her up, placing her gently in the backseat, and drove her to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital's antiseptic smell and air of concern were a far cry from the peaceful atmosphere I was used to, but I was too preoccupied with my mother's well-being to notice. I helped her onto the examination table, called out for the doctors, and watched anxiously as a team of professionals swarmed around us. My mother had taken a tumble off a step stool while reaching for a vase in the high cabinet.",
            "This study aimed to explore the relationship between adherence to the \"Mediterranean Diet\" - specifically the \"alternate Mediterranean diet score\" - and the risk of chronic heart disease and stroke.  The alternate Mediterranean diet is an offshoot of the Mediterranean diet, characterized by higher intake of plant-based foods, monounsaturated fats, and fish, along with lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate amounts of alcohol are also permitted.\n\nPast studies have shown that sticking to the Mediterranean diet reduces overall and cardiovascular mortality risk, and an intervention trial demonstrated that it's more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering bad cholesterol levels in obese individuals. However, these studies focused on mortality and weight loss, not specifically on stroke risk.\n\nThis epidemiological study tracked 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, who were part of the Nurses' Health Study - a long-term study of over 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. The researchers computed an alternate Mediterranean diet score six times between 1984 and 2004, using self-reported food frequency questionnaires that assessed participants' nutrient intake over the past year. An impressive 95% of the nurses remained in the study for the full 20 years. The diet scores were validated through various studies and verified against medical records, hospital reports, and death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, cases were considered \"probable\" and included - about 17% of all strokes and 24% of non-fatal heart attacks were classified this way.\n\nOther factors, such as body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use, were also calculated for each food frequency questionnaire. Starting in 1986, participants' leisure-time physical activity was also assessed.\n\nTo minimize random variation and better reflect long-term dietary habits, the researchers averaged the alternate Mediterranean diet scores over two prior years. Adjustments were made for potential confounders like age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing Cox proportional-hazard modeling, the researchers examined the link between the alternate Mediterranean diet score and the risk of heart disease and stroke, with separate models for fatal and non-fatal cases. The results showed that higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher alternate Mediterranean diet score, was associated with a lower risk of heart disease and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, there were 2391 cases of heart disease, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular deaths (fatal heart disease and strokes combined). Women in the top alternate Mediterranean diet quintile had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "The year 2007 marked the beginning of a severe economic downturn in the United States, with unemployment on the rise, the housing market in shambles, and several of America's largest corporations left reeling. The aftermath of this crisis still lingers, prompting a pressing question: what led to this calamity and how can we prevent it from happening again?  At its core, the financial disaster was born from a catastrophic mix of shortsighted and naive policy decisions that coerced banks and financial institutions into dooming themselves with reckless sub-prime lending. This reckless lending was fueled by a woefully underdeveloped financial infrastructure, which was further exacerbated by the government's pressure on Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) to take on these flawed mortgages and repackage them into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the destructive cycle began, with banks and financial institutions transferring the chaos onto the very mortgages they had sold, and ultimately, onto the entire economy.\n\nLooking back to the Clinton era of 1999, the roots of this crisis began to take shape. President Clinton sought to bolster his popularity ahead of his re-election by easing lending restrictions, thereby setting the stage for the sub-prime crisis that would unfold seven years later. In a 1999 New York Times article, Steven Holmes astutely noted, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, was under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand its mortgage lending to low- and moderate-income individuals, while also pushing to maintain its impressive growth in profits.\" Holmes's warning was eerily prescient: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may struggle in times of economic downturn, necessitating a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As we now know, this ill-conceived lending strategy would ultimately lead to the economic meltdown.\n\nSeveral factors converged to send the economy into a tailspin, including the proliferation of complex mortgage structures such as adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These innovations served to further entangle various sectors of the economy with the housing market, leaving U.S. households and financial markets precariously exposed to even minor fluctuations in housing prices. The housing bubble inevitably burst, leaving financial institutions that had invested in mortgage-backed securities reeling. By 2007, the top five U.S. investment banks collectively held an astonishing $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, accounting for approximately 30% of the country's GDP. The aftermath was brutal: Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at fire-sale prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to adapt to a life of intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie, staggering under $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, the infamous exposition - that pesky chapter in your story where you take a deep breath, stretch your writing wings, and either dazzle or bore your readers to tears.  Dr. Merlin has been known to let out a frustrated groan at her computer screen when she finds herself lost in a sea of unnecessary details, and not the exciting kind either.\n\nExposition isn't exactly your best friend.\n\nYou've likely heard the age-old writing tip: \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still falls into the trap of lengthy passages that leave the reader wondering when the actual story will start.  Exposition is that nagging voice in your ear, urging you to get the backstory out of the way so you can move on to the juicy parts (not to be confused with the other voice whispering in your ear to share every single detail about each character's childhood).\n\nIn its simplest form, exposition is when you spell out the details of what happened, often in a straightforward style.  In film, it's the scene where one character spews out a bunch of information to another, à la \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, it's often the author doing the telling.\n\nLet's examine an example.  Imagine you're reading a story where you're told that the heroine met her beloved at a certain time and place, they had a lavish wedding, and her husband was tragically murdered before her eyes.  You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to take up two pages, with only a couple of lines of dialogue from each of them.  You'd expect the author to delve deeper into the husband's character, showcasing his devotion through his words and actions, and you'd also expect to see the heroine's transformation through small, telling moments that reveal how much his presence enriched her life.  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally invested in his fate and gain insight into the heroine's character: what drew her to him, the depth of their connection, and clues about her thoughts, values, and dreams as reflected through his eyes.  You'd mourn his loss alongside her, deepening your connection to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you'd want more substance behind the bare bones of the plot: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, it's your job to provide that depth.  Sometimes, it's tempting to rush past certain things.  You might introduce a new character, mentioning that he used to be in the Air Force, works as the night manager of a gas station, has been married twice, has no kids, enjoys fishing on weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I tuned into the local news from Columbus, Ohio, watching the NBC 4 broadcast on August 13, 2011. The morning's lead story was a live report about a disturbing incident in Ashley, Ohio, where a man named Shad Hostettler had allegedly stabbed his wife. Although her name wasn't mentioned, I was shocked by his mug shot, which seemed to convey an aura of malevolence. The news team devoted a relatively brief two minutes to this developing story, providing only the bare essentials – multiple stab wounds and an arrest. I think they struck the right balance.\n\nThe next story covered an early morning shooting in the Sharon Woods area, which had left 18-year-old Travis Buyers critically injured. The SWAT Team was investigating, but no arrests had been made, and no suspects were identified. This report felt truncated, and I couldn't help but speculate that the reason might have been the victim's racial background. I've noticed this phenomenon before – that the media often glosses over crimes committed against minorities. In contrast, when a white child or adult is a victim, the news coverage is inevitably more extensive. \n\nThe news then shifted to the discovery of a gunshot hole in a Med-Flight helicopter. Details were provided about the estimated location of the incident, and it was determined that a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle was responsible. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for any information leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nI was also treated to a brief weather forecast, which warned of rain and thunderstorms on Saturday afternoon. Although the temperatures were expected to remain in the mid-to-low eighties for the weekend, the report felt rushed, almost like a teaser to keep viewers engaged.\n\nThe news also covered a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The perpetrator was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt, standing at around six feet tall and weighing approximately 150 pounds. I found it striking that the news team spent an unusual amount of time emphasizing his racial characteristics and skin tone.\n\nFinally, I came across a story about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin who had been found guilty of conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. What caught my attention was the unusual way the news team presented his sentence – 300 months rather than 25 years. I'm not sure if they thought this sounded more severe or if it was just a stylistic choice. They also highlighted Rodriguez's Hispanic heritage, which seemed inconsequential to the story itself.",
            "There's an unshakeable connection between brothers – a bond that's both beautiful and brutal, full of contradictions. This complicated link is woven with threads of love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. Brothers have a unique understanding of one another, a sense of kinship that surpasses all other relationships. When they gaze at each other, they catch glimpses of themselves, unfiltered and raw. It's during life's darkest moments that the true nature of this bond is laid bare, revealing both its beauty and ugliness. The consequences of this complex web of emotions can be overwhelming, but they're an essential part of the fraternal experience. When you lock eyes with a brother and see your own reflection staring back, you're confronted with the truth – not the way others see you, but the truth of who you are. It's in the actions you take and the repercussions that follow that your character is truly revealed.\n\nIn James Hurst's poignant short story, \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" we're given a glimpse into this intricate bond between two brothers. Set against the vibrant backdrop of a lush landscape, their doomed journey unfolds, marked by the clash of bitter disappointment and intense pride in a pivotal moment. Only one brother emerges alive, leaving behind a trail of questions and reflections. Through the protagonist's characterization and his interactions with his brother, Doodle, as well as the narrator's insightful perspective, we're shown the depth of their emotions and the world around them. These factors heavily influence the protagonist's actions, driving him towards a tragic fate.\n\nAt the heart of the story lies the protagonist's all-consuming pride. From the moment he begins to take his little brother on adventures to their fateful, final excursion, he's harbored a deep-seated resentment towards Doodle. He'd envisioned a brother who could keep up with him, sharing in the joys of physical activities like holding his breath, running, and climbing vines in the swamp. He wanted a partner to explore the world with, someone to share in the excitement of racing to the landing and perching in the top of the pine tree. But Doodle's fragile heart made these dreams impossible, leaving the protagonist with a crushing sense of disappointment. He even entertains the thought of suffocating his brother, a revelation that speaks to the complexities of his own psyche. Yet, his resolve crumbles when Doodle smiles at him, revealing a glimmer of love that's been lurking beneath the surface all along. This tender moment humanizes the protagonist, showing that his conviction wasn't as strong as he thought.",
            "Our minds are incredibly complex, information-processing machines. Over time, our understanding of the brain has evolved, and so have the metaphors used to describe it. We used to compare it to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, a book, and most recently, a computer. But as we delve deeper, we realize that these comparisons have limitations, and could lead us down a path of misconceptions.\n\nInformation trickles into our brains through our senses, transformed from physical stimuli like touch, heat, light, and sound into electrical signals. As this information bounces around in our brains, it's processed in two distinct ways: bottom-up and top-down. When I look at a picture of a black box on a white background, my brain starts by identifying the simple details, like color and orientation, and builds from there to conclude I'm looking at a box. But then, my brain uses its prior knowledge to speed up the process, identifying it as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole.\n\nOnce our brains have processed information to some extent, we have to decide what's important and what can be ignored. An attention filter kicks in, prioritizing signals and deciding which cognitive processes get access to the information. For instance, I can process every blade of grass when I'm looking down, but a healthy attention filter keeps me from noticing them individually. On the other hand, I can pick out my own name in a noisy room, even if it's not the loudest sound.\n\nThere are multiple stages to information processing, and our brains modulate the results at each stage, using attention to refine and prioritize. Before our brains can process information, it first needs to be stored. There are three main types of memory: sensory, working, and long-term. When information enters our brains, it's encoded, a process that varies depending on the type of sensory input. For written words, this might involve analyzing their structure, sound, or meaning.\n\nOnce information is stored, it needs to be maintained. Research on animals suggests that working memory, which stores information for about 20 seconds, relies on an electrical signal looping through specific neurons for a short period. Long-term memory, on the other hand, is thought to be stored in the structure of proteins.\n\nDifferent theories exist about how our brains organize knowledge, each drawing from psychology, computer science, and neurophysiology. One such model, the semantic network, proposes that concepts are represented by nodes, linked together based on their relatedness. For example, if I think of a chair, it might be connected to the concept of a table, which could be linked to wood, and so forth.",
            "Aldous Huxley's dystopian novel Brave New World paints a stark picture of a world where technology and a capitalistic system have created a society where individuality is suffocated and people are conditioned to prioritize immediate gratification above all else. The community takes precedence over the individual, with citizens molded from birth to crave instant happiness and obedience. But scratch beneath the surface, and you'll find that these people are mere pawns in a larger game, their lives dictated by the World Controller's iron-fisted ideology. A Marxist lens reveals Huxley's deep-seated suspicions about the impending dangers of these systems, with terms like homogeny and reification echoing through his narrative like a warning bell.\n\nThrough the lens of Marxist theory, particularly the concept of false consciousness, Huxley skewers capitalism's manipulation of the common folk. People are kept in the dark about their true place in the economic hierarchy, too busy chasing their own self-interest to notice the strings being pulled from above. The lower classes, Delta, Gamma, and so on, are conditioned to crave, consume, and indulge, their willpower subverted by the hypnotic power of hypnopædia. The World Controller pulls the strings, orchestrating this spectacle of consumerism with an iron fist. Hegemony, the notion that certain groups dominate others, is writ large in this dystopian world, where the lower classes are oblivious to their exploitation, buying into an ideology that reinforces their oppression. The upper classes, meanwhile, are either born with the knowledge or acquire it early on, but they do little to challenge the status quo, content to occupy their place in the hierarchy.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships between individuals are shallow and superficial. Characters lack depth, and even among the main characters, their interactions are one-dimensional. Huxley may be suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism has drained humanity of its free will and emotional expression. Love, passion, and genuine human connection are absent, replaced by surface-level interactions that reduce people to mere objects of desire. The societal classes' complacency with their roles in the hierarchy is a testament to the effects of capitalism, where people are told they're superior as long as they consume, obey, and conform to the norms of their peers.",
            "It's been nearly three years since I enrolled at University Park, and I've found that navigating the campus has become a major challenge. For many of us, including myself, getting from one place to another can be a real headache. My freshman year, I was stuck in an East Halls dorm room - the farthest outpost on campus, with the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center being the only structures beyond it. With classes scattered throughout the campus, including far-flung spots like the Willard building near the center, traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to those destinations could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially when the weather turned nasty. I recently spoke to a fellow alum who's not much older than me, and they shared that not too long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the university by vast tracts of undeveloped land. That vacant space has since been transformed into sports fields, sleek new buildings like the Creamery and health services building, and apartment complexes. As the campus continues to expand, it's getting increasingly difficult to get from one place to another.\n\nI had a conversation with a friend who'd recently dusted off their bike after a several-year hiatus, and they expressed their surprise at how much they'd missed it. \"Bikes are the way to go,\" they said. \"For a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Not only is bicycling great exercise, but it's also the most efficient way to travel. You can cover 30 miles or more with just a bowl of oatmeal and some physical exertion. I've since moved off campus, just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I made this year was buying a bike. With classes in Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from my home, bike-riding has shaved off 20 minutes from my daily commute. However, Pollock Road is the most direct route to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always the easiest road to navigate, bike or not. There are some advantages to walking, but personally, I'm too busy to walk every day. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option, and it would take about 30-40 minutes to get to Thomas building. That's over two and a half hours a week - a significant chunk of time I just can't afford to waste."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "I've always felt a deep desire to make a positive impact on the lives of others, particularly children who have been dealt a rough hand. As I pursue a degree in social work, I'm drawn to the Division of Family and Children Services, where I can be a source of comfort and support for those in need. At the heart of my approach are several core values: a commitment to service, respect for those I serve, and an unwavering dedication to ethics. I believe in striving to improve relationships between individuals and families, while also continually honing my skills to stay ahead in the field. These values aren't just professional ideals; they're deeply ingrained in my personal character.\n\nFor a long time, I was torn about my career path. I'd witness friends and classmates struggling with problems, and some would cope with unhealthy tactics. Those experiences led me to major in Psychology in college. Even with that degree, I still felt uncertain about my future. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break to figure things out. That's when my life took a dramatic turn. One summer, I visited a friend, and she introduced me to a 16-year-old boy who was visibly shaken. He was there to escape his abusive home life. The next day, I found out he'd called the police, and I decided to intervene. I drove to his parents' house, explained my concerns to the authorities, and shared my background as a recent Psychology graduate. The police asked me to speak with the parents, as they were at a loss for what to do. When I questioned the parents, they seemed evasive, making excuses for their son's actions. That encounter left a lasting impression on me, and I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help families resolve conflicts peacefully.\n\nSocial justice is another value that drives me in this field. We claim to value individuality, but our society often pressures people to conform. I've always been drawn to authenticity and self-expression. In high school and college, I made a point to challenge social norms: I dyed my hair bold colors, wore clothes that reflected my personality, got piercings that made a statement, joined the GSBA, and spoke out against racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it. I believe in fighting for what's right, and I'll continue to do so.",
            "As I delve into the realm of insomnia, I find myself entwined in the complex dance between biological and sociocultural models. The biological model peels back the layers, revealing the intricate web of genetic information and medical aspects that contribute to this sleep disorder. Conversely, the sociocultural model takes a step back, examining the environmental relationships that weave together race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review embarks on a journey to dissect these models, scrutinizing research that sheds light on the intricacies of insomnia and its underlying causes.\n\nInsomnia can be categorized into three distinct umbrellas: primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders tied to mental health, and sleep disorders linked to medical complications or substance intake. The primary sleep disorders are either Dyssonmias or Parasomnias. Dyssonmias, which include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, and others, are characterized by difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep. Conversely, Parasomnias, such as Nightmare Disorder and Sleep Terror Disorder, are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and physiological occurrences.\n\nAs I navigate the labyrinth of sleep disorders, I find myself questioning the role of genetics and physiology in the development of insomnia. Research has shown that neurons in the hypothalamus, specifically those containing orexin, play a pivotal role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice revealed that phenotypic GABAB receptors on these neurons are responsible for sleep-wake states. When the GABAA receptor is activated, it induces responses that promote sleep, while its inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and induced sleep. The findings suggest that the genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans may be linked to sleep regulation, and alterations in this receptor could disrupt sleep patterns. The sociocultural implications of this discovery are profound, highlighting the potential for inherited phenotypes to regulate sleep and the subsequent impact on daily life.",
            "Digging into Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), I found myself navigating three main areas: first, understanding the disorder itself; second, the process of diagnosis; and third, what teachers in a mainstreamed classroom can do to support students with CAPD.\n\n CAPD, or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is basically about the brain's ability to process what we hear. It's not about hearing loss, but rather the brain's challenge in deciphering, separating, and making sense of sound. People with CAPD can hear just fine, but their brain's internal messaging system, the central nervous system (CNS), can't quite keep up. They might pick up on individual sounds, but struggle to distinguish between different voices, conversations, or background noise.\n\nI stumbled upon the term \"auditory imperception\" in the 1950s, when researchers first identified it as a potential issue in kids with communication disorders. Since then, tests have been developed to help diagnose and understand CAPD. Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari started testing kids in 1954, and by 1961, Kimura introduced a new way of evaluating CAPD through dichotic testing. This sparked a wave of research, culminating in a national conference in 1977.\n\nCAPD presents itself in various ways. For some, it's difficulty pinpointing where sounds are coming from or distinguishing between multiple sounds. Others might struggle to recognize patterns or detect changes in speech, such as sarcasm. They might also get interrupted by one sound blocking another or struggle to piece together sound clues to make sense of them. Then there's the challenge of following the sequence of sounds.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD requires a thorough evaluation, often involving observation and tests administered by experts like audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and others. This might include questionnaires, surveys, and observing how the person responds to different sounds. There's no single, magic test that gets it right every time, and sadly, we still don't know what causes CAPD. Tests often involve presenting multiple sounds simultaneously and asking the individual to pick out specific items, like words or numbers. Some more advanced tests record sound waves within the ear and measure the brain's response.",
            "The play Twelfth Night suggests that donning a disguise can be an effective way to deceive others, but ultimately, it's a precarious game that can lead to losing oneself in the process. The problem with dropping a disguise is that it can lead to feelings of alienation, as one must then confront the consequences of their deception. This raises a difficult question: is it better to prioritize one's own self-preservation or the preservation of relationships with those around them? While some people might respond with indifference to being tricked, others may not take kindly to the deception, and their reaction can be anything but pleasant.\n\nThe idea of deception through gender role reversal is particularly complex, as it brings up a multitude of questions. One of the most pressing ones is, what drives someone to hide their true identity and adopt a disguise of the opposite sex? In the case of Viola, her decision is a desperate attempt to protect herself from harm: \"I'll take you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249). As a foreigner in a new land, Viola feels compelled to disguise herself as a man to avoid becoming a target. However, this ruse ultimately isolates her from the women around her, depriving her of a vital support system.\n\nViola's disguise is so convincing that Olivia becomes smitten with her, mistaking her for Sebastian: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138). Furthermore, Viola is forced to navigate her own suppressed desires for Orsino: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1.260-261). While this might seem like a progressive attitude to some, Twelfth Night can also be seen as a portrayal of how deception can facilitate the revelation of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages suggest that these characters may have unexpressed desires that are brought to the surface by Viola's disguise. For instance, is Olivia drawn to Cesario because of his masculine appearance, or does she secretly harbor feelings for women? Although it's unlikely that Olivia is genuinely attracted to women, her character can be seen as a satire of those who judge others based on appearance alone.\n\nThis is evident in the ease with which Olivia shifts her affections from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a romantic interest: \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315)",
            "The brutal nature of German colonial rule has been a subject of much discussion, particularly with regards to the atrocities committed against the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa.  But let's not get too hasty – the German colonial empire was a multifaceted beast with an array of policies and ruling styles as diverse as its geography. Educational provision across the colonies was equally varied, reflecting the complexities of this complex system. When the British took over German East Africa (now Tanganyika) in 1919, they encountered a surprisingly large population of educated and literate Africans, a stark contrast to the story of German colonial efforts elsewhere.\n\nIn particular, the situation in South West Africa – present-day Namibia – stands out as a jarring exception. Unlike East Africa, where the government took an active role in educating the native population, in South West Africa this responsibility fell largely to missionary societies, which received meager support from the government. Meanwhile, the government lavished significant resources on the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing a system of state schools and heavily subsidizing and regulating missionary schools. The effects of these policies persisted long after German rule had ended, leaving a lasting impact on South West Africa. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, here the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\n\nSo what explains this divergent experience of South West Africa? A range of social, economic, and political factors played a role, and I aim to shed more light on these in this paper. I'll focus particularly on fresh research into the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans, a topic that's been under-explored.\n\nThere's no shortage of literature on education in the German colonial empire, with much of it written in German during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. These early works tend to focus on describing the features of educational systems in the various colonies. Later studies, written in English, took a more comparative approach, examining education in the different German colonies and delving deeper into specific aspects of education. These studies revealed significant disparities in the educational systems of different colonies, with each one having its own unique flavor. One of the most influential works on this topic is Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies, highlighting the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa was a major factor in shaping the colony's educational system.\n\nThe German colonial territories in Africa presented a stark contrast in terms of climate, with South West Africa boasting a relatively mild climate, albeit with large expanses of arid desert. This relatively hospitable environment drew a significant number of European settlers – by 1913, nearly 15,000 whites called South West Africa home, compared to just 5,336 in East Africa, which had the next largest settler population.",
            "Over the last century, the landscape of popular music has undergone a seismic shift, branching into an array of genres that's become increasingly difficult to catalog. To make matters more complex, most, if not all, genres - think rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, and the like - have spawned a multitude of sub and sub-sub genres, each with its own distinct flavor. One genre that stands out as particularly diverse and expressive is Heavy Metal, which has evolved dramatically over the past 40 years to encompass a kaleidoscope of emotions, predominantly leaning towards the darker end of the emotional spectrum.\n\nHeavy Metal's flexibility has always been its defining trait, allowing artists to experiment and create their own sub-genres, which in turn have spawned an array of sub-sub-genres. As a result, the genre has become so diverse that it's challenging to pinpoint exactly what Heavy Metal is. It's a genre that has incorporated elements from other styles, yet its roots can be traced back to a singular movement.\n\nAt its core, Heavy Metal is a movement defined by its affinity for the darker aspects of life. It's a music of excess - more bass, more volume, more aggression, and more theatrics. Heavy Metal musicians are known for their technical prowess, evident in the complexity of their playing. Additionally, the genre has a long history of being closely tied to substance abuse, particularly in the 1970s, when a psychedelic drug boom led to the creation of unconventional, otherworldly music. The genre's visceral qualities, which often explored the darker side of the emotional spectrum, were a refreshing departure from the more lighthearted popular music of the time. Later generations of metal artists drew inspiration from the Romantic Era's dark, intense qualities, reflecting the genre's ongoing exploration of the human experience.\n\nLyrics like those found in Helter Skelter, a song often cited as one of the first Heavy Metal songs, exemplify the genre's affinity for the darker side of human nature. This song, penned by John Lennon, is a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier, darker sound, showcasing the Beatles' ability to create music that's just as intense. It's a testament to the genre's willingness to push boundaries and challenge conventions.",
            "Before the Surrealist artists set brush to canvas, painting their dreamlike masterpieces, the talented Henri Rousseau was crafting his own visions, quite literally. His 1910 work, The Dream, is a painting that's more than just a woman's enchantment with the wonders of a fantastical land - it's also a reflection of Rousseau's own dreams and aspirations as an artist. For years, he yearned for recognition, acceptance, and praise from his peers and art enthusiasts alike, but this desire came with a daunting challenge: should he conform to the art world's expectations or forge his own path and risk being unconventional?\n\nTo truly grasp the significance of The Dream, one needs to delve into Rousseau's remarkable life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in the French town of Laval, Rousseau's father was a prosperous businessman who enjoyed a comfortable lifestyle. Despite his comfortable upbringing, Rousseau himself received no formal art training, instead working as an employee of the municipal toll service until he was forty. He earned the nickname douanier, or customs inspector, but this moniker didn't capture the full extent of his talents. The loss of his first wife and eight infant children left Rousseau with only one child and a deep sense of sorrow, which he attempted to alleviate through painting. Unlike his contemporaries, who often romanticized the peasant in their art, Rousseau was a folk painter, driven by the hopes and dreams of the ordinary man.\n\nRousseau's obsession with being accepted by the art world was understandable, especially considering his late start and lack of formal training. He was producing art alongside some of the most talented and renowned modern artists of his time. It wasn't until around the same period that Matisse began building his reputation as an artist that Rousseau finally received the recognition he so desperately sought. Author Jan Gordon aptly pointed out the contrast between the two artists, noting that while Matisse aimed to avoid triteness in his work, Rousseau's goal was to create something so conventional that it would earn him acceptance into the Artiste Français.",
            "It's no secret that philosophers have long been fascinated by the intricate connection between ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. I firmly believe that there's a reason for this profound link. As John Keats beautifully puts it in his iconic poem \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty – That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Our understanding of the world is largely shaped by education and experience, but our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics seems to transcend these conventional paths. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe, rather than dictate. Our studies of morality and beauty are efforts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful or why an action is moral, rather than providing a set of rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nIn essence, criticism of art or morals can never fully capture the essence of what's great or beautiful. Analyzing the value of the Mona Lisa, for instance, might delve into aspects like composition, contrast, or cultural context, but these don't encapsulate why it's considered a masterpiece. When people discuss their favorite work of art or literature, they often start with a phrase like, \"There's just something about it,\" followed by a more in-depth explanation. I believe that both art and morals can't be reduced to a description of their qualities alone. As the inimitable Flannery O'Connor astutely observed, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way...You tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we examine the properties of a work of literature, there's an intangible quality that remains. I'm convinced that ethics shares this same property. As Wittgenstein insightfully notes, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" This \"something\" – this je ne sais quoi – is, in my opinion, the most powerful attribute of art and morality, and it provides a common ground between them.\n\nI believe that morality and art are deeply connected because we experience both at a profoundly personal level, to use a Kantian term. They impact us in ways that can be felt, but not fully explained. This connection is even more pronounced when it comes to literature. As McKean so eloquently puts it, \"What most distinguishes literature from other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values...Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "The Germany we know today is a powerhouse, a unified nation with its own unique cultural identity, spanning from the Alpine shadows of München to the Baltic Sea's shores in Kiel. The cultural thread that weaves through this vast land can be traced from Köln on the Rhine, through the heart of Germany, all the way to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. Given its rich heritage, it's no surprise that modern-day Germany has roots from a tapestry of different sources and tribes.\n\nThe cradle of Germanic culture is known as Germania, but the true origins of its name are shrouded in mystery. Some scholars point to the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe, as the source, while others suggest that the name might have derived from the Gauls' term for their neighbor. I find it fascinating to learn about the various theories surrounding the name's etymology. Julius Caesar's writings on the Gallic Wars offer a glimpse into the early use of the term \"Germanus,\" which he borrowed from the Gauls to distinguish between the conquered and unconquered tribes. In his commentary, Caesar notes, \"The Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they are continually waging war... They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC)\n\nWhile the name's true meaning remains uncertain, some theories propose that it might be related to the spear used in warfare, known as a \"ger,\" or the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" which could imply that the Germans were known for their loud and boisterous nature. The Roman historian Tacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" offers a captivating account of the Germans' origins, describing them as a people untouched by other cultures, with a unique identity that was not shaped by immigration or external influences. According to Tacitus, \"Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\" (Tacitus, 98)\n\nIt's intriguing to consider why the Romans, despite their conquests, never fully settled in Germania. Instead, they traded with the Germanic tribes, who offered their goods and skills in exchange for Roman hospitality. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they lived on the fringes of the Roman Empire, exchanging their wares and expertise for a place within the Roman army's ranks. This complex web of cultural exchange and trade laid the foundation for the Germany we know today, a nation with a rich tapestry of influences and a distinct cultural identity.",
            "As I stood there, my mind went blank, unable to grasp the scene unfolding before me. I stared unemotionally, disconnected from the moment, observing the world around me with a practiced detachment. Thoughts flitted through my mind, only to vanish as quickly as they appeared, leaving me with a sense of disconnection from my own thoughts. My consciousness was a smooth, unbroken flow, like a serene stream, with no distinct thoughts of my own, just a fluid experience of the world around me.\n\nI recall purchasing an art instruction book, 'The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,' after getting advice from a fellow artist. I'd always been fascinated by drawing since I was six, and this book promised to teach me the basics, from understanding the humble pencil to grasping how our brains interpret lines. One technique caught my eye: placing a frame around any picture to simplify its complexity. By doing so, a chaotic scene, like a still life of fruit on a table, could be reduced to a manageable, two-dimensional image.\n\nAt that moment, gazing down at the offending object in front of me, I couldn't mentally impose that frame. I was overwhelmed, awed, and unable to process the situation. If I had any aspirations of being an artist, this was the beginning of my masterpiece, the start of my story, titled 'Work in Brown.'\n\nMy hand instinctively reached for my tool of art, and I felt a surge of creative energy. Water flowed smoothly, crystal clear, and serene. Flakes of matter broke away, carried off into nothingness. But as my hand moved, muscles tensed and spasmed, and my hand struck the toilet handle for the second time. The stubborn, brown, unwanted package refused to budge, stuck like a slug on the toilet bowl.\n\nMop in hand, feet apart, and a green tie strangling my neck, I frowned, staring at the offending bundle left for the unsuspecting janitor at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more moments of introspection, and my hand reached for the toilet paper roll, began to wrap itself in toilet paper until it resembled a makeshift oven mitt. Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, I slowly dipped my hand into the bowl, a slow, deliberate movement like a mother preparing to retrieve the Thanksgiving turkey from the oven.",
            "The alarming statistics on teenage driving fatalities paint a somber picture - a deadly vector that's claiming lives behind the wheel. Several factors contribute to this disturbing trend, but one crucial aspect is the developmental stage of the teen brain, which is simply not equipped to handle the perils of driving. Inexperience is another major factor, not only leading to tragic accidents but also higher rates of rollover crashes, speeding, and driving off the road.\n\nThe teenage tendency to drive with peers is a recipe for disaster, and studies have consistently shown a correlation between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents. California and other states have tried to mitigate this issue by introducing temporary provisional licenses that restrict the number of hours teens can drive and prohibit minors as passengers. However, these measures are, in my opinion, mere Band-Aids on a festering wound.\n\nThe real issue lies in the fact that, statistically speaking, young drivers are not capable of adequately handling the risks and responsibilities associated with driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman has conducted research suggesting that even 18 is too young for a full driver's license, citing a common desire among those under 19-20 to engage in thrill-seeking behavior. It's logical, then, to delay driving until this tendency has subsided. If we continue to issue licenses to young teens, we risk seeing a devastating spike in fatalities, with potentially disastrous consequences by 2010 when the Baby Boomer generation's children will be hitting the roads.\n\nA relatively straightforward legislative solution exists. Schools could continue to offer driver's education classes to initiate the learning process, but no one under 18 should be allowed to operate a vehicle. A provisional permit could still be granted before a full license is issued, accompanied by a set number of practical training hours. The hours required could be based on existing state regulations, such as California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult. Uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable and effective means of protecting young drivers across the nation.\n\nThis proposal is not a novel idea, but it's a necessary step towards mitigating the staggering statistics on teenage driving fatalities.",
            "Browsing through the Library of Congress's archives of early Edison films, I stumbled upon a trove of trick films from 1895 to 1901, a total of fifteen mind-bending masterpieces. These films playfully exploit creative editing to create illusions that deceive and delight. My film study delved into the poetic elements that make trick films tick and analyzed the innovative leaps forward in a few of the later ones. At the turn of the century, trick films typically played out within the confines of a set-bound, frontal proscenium, featuring static cameras and sticking to a strict one-shot-per-film rule. However, as the century progressed, some filmmakers began to break free from these constraints by introducing novel techniques like multiple shots.\n\nOne striking commonality among trick films is their tendency to be set within the confines of a single interior scene, framed by a frontal proscenium. The camera remains steadfast in its position, refusing to follow figures or objects as they move. This composition, a staple of early cinema, drew its roots from the world of theatre and the vaudeville and magic acts that inspired it. The limitations of the stage-based setup resulted in figures moving horizontally within the frame, never venturing closer or further away from the lens. Take, for instance, the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where the actors enter from the right, moving back and forth along the horizontal axis, never straying beyond the camera's fixed frame.\n\nThe use of the frontal proscenium also led to a preponderance of long shots and, occasionally, medium shots, with close-ups being a rare sight. This adherence to traditional theatre and vaudeville conventions meant that the audience would see the entire performance at a given time, framed by the borders of the stage. In early films, actors rarely moved towards or away from the camera, making close-ups a non-existent phenomenon. Most trick films from the Edison catalog conform to the one-conceptual-shot-equals-one-film rule, restricting their length to approximately a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. This also limited the narrative and dramatic potential of these films, which generally focused on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic and disappearing acts, with little story to speak of. However, upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that one conceptual shot can be comprised of multiple physical shots, cleverly joined together to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance. The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) is a prime example, where a thorough examination reveals the precise moment where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the film is conceptually one shot in the viewer's eyes.",
            "I've always been intrigued by the story of John Taylor of Caroline, a man who embodied the spirit of Republicanism in its early days. As an agriculturalist by profession, his passion for the land and the values it represented shaped his views on personal freedom and government. His strong convictions on preserving the agrarian system underpinned his arguments on sovereignty, the Constitution, and the judicial system, often making him a vocal advocate for limited government and individual rights.\n\nTaylor believed that the United States had a unique opportunity to create a truly exceptional system of government, free from the constraints of traditional institutions. He was convinced that the declaration of natural rights, which he saw as interconnected and mutually dependent, should be beyond the reach of government. In his view, a government should acknowledge and balance the inherent duality of human nature, with its virtues and vices. He famously argued that, as government is exercised by humans, all its virtues and vices must be human as well.\n\nTo create an ideal society, Taylor proposed a government that would protect private property, promote agriculture, and discourage unchecked capitalism. He saw a well-founded government as one that would function equitably, despite the inevitable presence of self-interest and avarice in its administration. He believed that self-interest was a fundamental human drive, but it only became a problem when it led to the exploitation of others. A good government, he thought, was necessary to contain humanity's darker aspects and prevent the spread of bad principles.\n\nAs a staunch Republican, Taylor championed a strict construction of the Constitution, advocating for a limited federal government with only explicitly stated powers. He recognized that an expansive federal government was likely to be costly and tyrannical, yet he cautioned against a simplistic, literal interpretation of the Constitution, which could lead to corruption. For Taylor, the Declaration of Independence served as the true charter of the United States, providing a clearer vision of the country as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Looking back at Figure 17, I noticed a sudden and alarming drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. It was a bit disheartening and left me wondering what could have caused it. As the winter months rolled in at our New England campus, it's not a stretch to assume that the decrease in foot and bike traffic contributed to the decline. The end of the fall semester in December also brought a flurry of activity - students were finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and were probably too busy to bother with logging their commutes. The holiday season and subsequent month-long break didn't help, either - many students and faculty were on vacation, and the campus was eerily quiet. It wasn't until late January, with the start of the spring semester, that things picked up again, but even that didn't explain the low numbers for February. We had hypothesized that our project might experience a natural ebb in enthusiasm after the initial excitement wore off, and the Carpool Challenge Week campaign we launched in March was designed to combat this by injecting a burst of energy and enthusiasm. It worked, at least temporarily, as log submissions increased during that month. However, the bigger challenge we faced was how to maintain momentum amidst the natural fluctuations in engagement caused by semester breaks and holidays.\n\nAnother hurdle we encountered was the deeply ingrained cultural preference for driving one's own car. People love their independence and flexibility, and it's no wonder many were hesitant to give up their keys. To combat this, we tried offering prizes - gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, and bookstores - but it would have been interesting to see how bigger, more enticing prizes would have affected participation. For instance, giving away a brand new bike, hybrid car, or electric car might have been just the thing to boost engagement and combat that initial decline. We stuck with the same prize structure throughout the project, but if we had gradually increased the value of the prizes - announcing bigger and better prizes each month - it might have helped keep people engaged and motivated.",
            "I've recently found myself pondering the mystique of ETFs, or exchange-traded funds, and the benefits that come with them. Essentially, an ETF is a security that mirrors an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets, much like an index fund. But unlike its more rigid counterpart, an ETF offers flexibility and trades on an exchange like a stock, giving you the best of both worlds. On one hand, an ETF provides the diversification of an index fund and the perks of single stock ownership, such as the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and even purchase a single share in a transaction. However, these benefits come with a catch – the expense ratios of ETFs tend to be significantly lower than those of the average mutual fund.\n\nWhile ETFs may seem like the holy grail of investing, there are some downsides to consider. For instance, you'll need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just like you would on a stock order. Not to mention the overwhelming array of funds available, which can make it challenging to determine whether the benefits you're promised actually pan out. As a savvy investor, it's essential to scrutinize the benefits, such as diversification, and evaluate their true extent. In this investigation, we'll be taking a closer look at the ETF IHF and comparing it to its top 10 holdings to see if the benefits of owning a single ETF come close to replicating the benefits of a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks.\n\nTo simplify our analysis, we'll focus on the top 10 holdings, which account for a substantial 63.58% of the ETF's assets. By examining these holdings, we can gain a better understanding of how well they represent the ETF as a whole. To do this, we can calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming a portfolio composed entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportions established by the ETF. The results of these calculations are presented in the chart below.\n\nA quick glance at the chart reveals that a portfolio consisting only of the top 10 holdings would yield a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Moreover, the Beta of the top 10 holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF as a whole, suggesting that this portfolio may offer a higher return with a lower risk. However, it's essential to note that these results may not be statistically significant, and further analysis is needed to confirm our findings.\n\nTo determine whether these portfolios are statistically distinct, we'll examine the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100% for comparison with the ETF IHF's accumulated standard deviation. This will give us a better understanding of the level of risk associated with each portfolio and help us determine whether the differences we've observed are statistically meaningful.",
            "In the realm of Edgar Allan Poe's literary masterpieces, \"Dream-Land\" stands out as one of his personal favorites. This poem is a testament to Poe's fascination with the concept of Thulé, which he references twice in the work. Interestingly, the term \"Thulé\" was first introduced by the ancient Greek poet Virgil, who used it to describe an island located beyond the edge of the known world. However, there's another source that deserves recognition - Poe's affinity for German authors. Poe's admiration for the works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe is well-documented, and it's likely that he drew inspiration from Goethe's writing.\n\nThe connection between Poe and Goethe is significant, as it highlights their shared themes and ideas. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" notes the striking similarities between their works, suggesting that Poe may have been influenced by Goethe's poetry. The Oxford Companion to English Literature sheds more light on Goethe's works, including his celebrated poetic drama \"Faust,\" which was published in two parts in 1808 and 1832, respectively. Within the second part of \"Faust,\" there's a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé,\" which tells the story of a king who, after losing his wife, succumbs to grief and eventually dies.\n\nThe parallels between the King of Thulé and the narrator in \"Dream-Land\" are striking, with both characters grappling with loss and despair. Poe's use of Thulé as a recurring theme in his works, including \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" suggests a deeper exploration of the human experience. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe describes Thulé as a desolate and colorless world, haunted by the memories of the past. This eerie landscape echoes the King of Thulé's own desolate existence, as he mourns the loss of his beloved wife.\n\nGoethe's influence on Poe's work is further solidified by their shared connections to other notable authors, such as Alfred, Lord Tennyson. Poe's admiration for Tennyson is well-documented, and it's likely that he was exposed to Goethe's works through various reproductions and translations that were widely available after the original publication. The relationship between Poe and Goethe serves as a testament to the cross-pollination of ideas and influences that shaped the literary landscape of the 19th century.",
            "Can a customer who slipped and fell on an applesauce spill in a grocery store in California potentially win punitive damages if the store manager ignored two warnings to clean the spill and didn't act for half an hour because he was eating dinner?  It's likely that a judge won't dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim out of hand. To justify punitive damages, a plaintiff must show that the defendant's actions were a reckless disregard for the harm they could cause, and were truly despicable. Palmer can argue that the store manager, Martin, should have known the spill was a hazard because six people had slipped and fallen in the store in the months leading up to her accident, and still he didn't act. That's a pretty weak argument, but it's not entirely implausible given that Martin was informed about the spill twice, and still chose to ignore it while he had dinner.\n\nThe details of the case are pretty disturbing. On October 13th, an employee, Rich Wayne, told Martin about the spill at 5:00 pm, but Martin said he was too busy to deal with it. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary Haddigan, also warned Martin about the spill, but he still blew her off. It wasn't until 5:30 pm, when Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, that someone finally took action. It's not just this incident that suggests Martin didn't care about safety – five other people had slipped and fallen in the store in the same year. Palmer is now suing D&D for the injuries she sustained, and we're considering whether to ask the court to dismiss the claim for punitive damages.\n\nIn California, punitive damages are only available if a defendant has acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" The law defines malice as conduct that's meant to cause harm, or if not, conduct that's so despicable it shows a willful disregard for the rights and safety of others. A court has ruled that conduct is malicious if it shows a conscious disregard for the plaintiff's rights, especially when the defendant knows the harm that's likely to result from their actions. In this case, it seems like Martin knew the probable consequences of leaving the spill uncleaned, but chose to ignore them. That's not exactly the kind of behavior you'd expect from a store manager.",
            "It's been just shy of four years since I enrolled in a course on Islam at CBC. One question that consistently sparked heated debates in class was whether Islam is, in fact, a hostile religion. I think this topic has taken on even greater relevance in the years following 9/11. In retrospect, I've observed a shift in the way mass media portrays Islam, veering from an overwhelmingly negative stance to an extreme show of tolerance towards the faith in America. It's astonishing to consider that, in 2001, a presidential candidate with an obvious Muslim background, such as Barack Obama, would have been unimaginable.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad has piqued my interest due to the apparent disconnect between his historical persona and the character depicted in the biography. From what I've learned, I always thought Muhammad forced conversions to Islam, conquering tribes and imposing the faith upon them. However, the biography paints a very different picture of Muhammad, portraying him as a misunderstood martyr who humbled himself to others and patiently waited for people to seek him out after witnessing the \"truth\" in his teachings.\n\nWhat's striking to me is the uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the reported \"miracles\" of Muhammad. One notable example is the story of Muhammad multiplying mutton and milk to feed a group of forty men. The writing style used in these accounts makes me believe the authors were attempting to portray Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove anything, simply living in truth and experiencing miracles. This downplays the significance of Jesus' life and miracles, making it seem as though the authors are attempting to co-opt and profit from Jesus' legacy through Muhammad.\n\nFurthermore, many stories in the biography seem to be included to provide \"proof\" of the \"witness\" or the spontaneous conversion of people to Islam. However, I found this approach problematic, as a lot of these stories come from third-party accounts, often through a series of hearsay. This diminishes the stories and makes them seem even more suspicious.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this work is the attempted deification of Muhammad as a gentle, humble, wise, and endearing figure. Yet, historical records contradict this image, and I can't help but wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true history behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "As we look back at the foundation of Christianity, it's striking to see how quickly the teachings of Jesus were set aside in favor of the evolving ideas that shaped the faith after his time.  Taking a broad view of history, it becomes clear that Christianity has been gradually moving further and further away from its roots.  Yet, there's a growing sense of awareness and a progressive shift in today's world, which may signal a turning point.  While traditionalists will likely resist exploring beyond the established norms, their influence may wane as a more open-minded segment of the population gains traction.  In the years to come, Christians will increasingly seek a deeper understanding of their faith, distinguishing between the original intent of Jesus' message and the doctrines that have accumulated over time.  It's a process that may take centuries, but eventually, it's inevitable:  The trend of Christian history will reverse, and the faith will return to its original form.  A movement will emerge, peeling away the layers of dogma, layer by layer, as if the clock were rewinding, leaving only the essence of Jesus' teachings that he brought to humanity through God, untainted by the influences of later thinkers.  As this shift gains momentum in the United States and Europe, masses will be inspired to worship in a more authentic, unadulterated way, as if they were living in Jesus' time, following his ideas alone.  The church, as an institution, will remain a guiding force, but its teachings will become more uniform and less diverse, as differences between regions, denominations, and factions begin to fade.  History is replete with examples of reversals, like the transformation of the Roman Empire from a persecutor of Christians to a Christian institution, or the transition from African-American slavery to leadership.  The next great reversal will unfold within Christianity, a journey back to the source, where diversity is lost in the process.  A crucial aspect of this process will be to interpret Jesus' words as metaphors rather than literal statements.  So, let's examine the roots of Christianity:  If we dig deep into history, we find Judaism, the theological wellspring of the Christian faith.  By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were already central to Jewish thought.  Yet, the Jewish people were far from united, splintering into groups like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and ordinary folk.",
            "I believe that Upton Sinclair's The Jungle reveals the inherent self-interest and narcissism that lies within human nature. People are primarily driven by their own desires to improve their lives, without much concern for those around them. The novel masterfully illustrates this concept in various ways. The greedy factory owners and managers are the most obvious example. Their sole ambition is to expand their businesses and accumulate wealth, without regard for the consequences or any obstacles that may come their way. They carelessly disregard the harm caused by pollution, as evident in Sinclair's vivid description of the factories' pollution: \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". This potent imagery conveys the devastating impact of their actions on the environment and the people living nearby, who are exposed to the noxious fumes and unsanitary conditions of the factories.\n\nThe owners' disregard for their employees is equally appalling. They prioritize profits over people, as Sinclair notes, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They exploit their workers, forcing them to work long hours with little notice and zero compensation, and then cast them aside without a second thought when they're no longer needed. During the time period in which the novel is set, workers had little to no protection under the law, allowing the factory owners to run amok, pushing their employees to work faster and under harsh conditions. The novel implies that the workers were expected to accept these conditions without complaint, as there were no organizations or resources available to support them. Even the unions formed to represent the workers often ended up harming them more than helping, profiting off the misery of the poor. The workers were essentially treated as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "When weaving a narrative, authors often employ techniques to evoke a specific emotional response from their readers. Some methods prove more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald masterfully employs a variety of techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. He frequently pairs adjectives with nouns in unconventional ways to create an aura around a subject. At other times, he imbues a symbol with meaning, only to reuse it to convey a similar sentiment. Fitzgerald employs the latter technique with several colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, he builds associations for the colors white/gray, then later uses these connections to evoke a particular feeling in the reader when describing a significant object.\n\nFitzgerald skillfully constructs meaning for the colors white/gray, with white being associated with a more refined and upper-class tone, while gray is linked to something older and faded. He establishes this meaning early on in the novel by consistently using both colors. The characters of Daisy and Jordan are often \"in white\" (8), and, in fact, white is a ubiquitous color: Nick dons \"white flannels\" (41) to Gatsby's party, while Tom sports a \"white shirt\" (36) when he meets Myrtle. Catherine is even described as \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only exception to this is when Nick is describing his impressions of Gatsby's party: \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further reinforces these color associations by applying them to everyday, unremarkable subjects: when Nick commutes to work, he navigates \"the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the names of people at Gatsby's parties are now \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's schedule, and Catherine's apartment is likened to \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\" – a sense of uniformity (28). He also uses white or gray to describe ordinary people or places: Jordan and Daisy shared a \"white girlhood\" (19), there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" in the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nAfter establishing a strong connection between white/gray and uniformity/unimportance, Fitzgerald employs this color symbolism to convey a similar message about certain subjects. This begins with Daisy. Following a period of minimal use of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster\" (74), and readers start to perceive her as more of a uniform, almost interchangeable element, something Gatsby desires and longs for. Fitzgerald uses this technique repeatedly around Daisy to reinforce the idea that she is a more uniform addition, as seen in the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18) and her appearance in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County is the perfect place for a thriving agricultural operation, thanks to its incredibly mild and sunny climate. The region's rich soil and favorable weather conditions make it an ideal location for growing a diverse array of crops, including juicy tomatoes, succulent citrus fruits, leafy greens, squashes, broccoli, fragrant herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, luscious berries, sweet honey, and spicy peppers. With a growing demand for organic community-supported agriculture (CSA) programs, local farmers have a lucrative market to tap into, and many have lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also highly sought after, and innovative farmers are capitalizing on this trend. \n\nIn addition to the financial benefits, organic farming has a profound impact on the environment. By avoiding harsh chemicals, these farms become wildlife sanctuaries, boasting vibrant biodiversity and a healthier ecosystem. However, there are some trade-offs to consider. Organic farming requires more labor and management to maintain the soil and water quality without relying on chemicals, which can lead to higher costs and potential losses. Small organic farms also struggle with efficiency, lacking the scale of large industrial operations. To mitigate these challenges, landowners may seek financial assistance or expert guidance to maximize both profits and habitat quality.\n\nFor this hypothetical scenario, I've chosen a 160-acre property in unincorporated San Diego County, near the town of Potrero. This land is a unique blend of chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, situated next to the Cleveland National Forest. It falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which aims to protect over 100 species of plants and animals. Unfortunately, many of these species are endangered or declining, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher.\n\nThis land has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. The property was part of an original homestead patent, which likely meant it was used for grazing and/or wood production for many decades.\n\nTo better understand the possibilities and challenges of farming this land, I selected a real estate listing and researched government programs that could help mitigate costs and preserve wildlife-friendly operations. As a model for a small farmer in this area, I looked at an existing organic farm in the same region, striving to balance the needs of both people and the planet.",
            "The intricate dance of culture plays a pivotal role in any negotiation. But what exactly is culture? It's a complex entity that can be defined by what it's not as much as what it is, and what it signifies. Culture is not monolithic, nor is it a single, uniform thing. Reducing it to broad generalizations, such as \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating,\" can be misleading and overly simplistic. While understanding a culture's general characteristics can be helpful, it's far more productive to grasp the significance of that culture in the context of the negotiation and how it will shape the discussion. When navigating a foreign culture, we inevitably compare it to our own, and this can lead to a deeper understanding.\n\nDelving into a foreign culture or mindset requires a willingness to study its history, acknowledge its biases, and accept it for what it is. Rather than trying to change or judge a culture, it's essential to work within its boundaries, especially during negotiations, particularly when you're in a weaker bargaining position. When operating on \"away\" territory, respecting local traditions and beliefs can help break down cultural barriers and facilitate progress in the negotiation.\n\nCulture's scope extends beyond national or international boundaries. Companies within a country often establish their own distinct corporate culture, which can vary greatly. For instance, some companies value long working hours, while others prioritize a more relaxed schedule. This corporate culture is reflected in employee attire, communication styles, delegation of tasks, and hiring practices. Even within the United States, corporate culture differs significantly from company to company, and within companies, there's diversity from region to region and city to city.\n\nValues are crucial to grasp, as they provide the underlying motivations behind a culture. If saving face or maintaining communal harmony is a core value, a negotiator won't risk publicly embarrassing their company or superior. Conversely, a negotiator from a culture prioritizing hard-driven deals won't necessarily be eager to settle quickly. Considering these generalities is vital before sitting at the negotiation table, but it's also essential to learn about your opponent on a personal level to make the negotiation effective.",
            "A phrase often attributed to the Bible, \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God,'\" initially appears in Psalm 14, and it's also central to St. Anselm's argument on the existence of God. Thomas Aquinas shares a similar conviction. Since their arguments both defend the same concept, and our task is to determine which one is more compelling, we'll assume, for the sake of keeping things concise, that they're both correct in their faith in the God of the Bible. If we were to allow for a different conception of God, it would distort the comparison between their two arguments, as they're essentially in defense of a specific deity. \n\nLet's cut to the chase: both St. Anselm and St. Thomas Aquinas present valid points, but neither provides a comprehensive foundation for believing in God. To illustrate this point, let's dive into the core of St. Anselm's argument. In his writing, Anselm embarks on a journey of discovery through faith, seeking proof of God within one's own self. He posits that because we can't fully grasp the concept of God's nonexistence, it implies that God must exist within our understanding. While his explanation can be a bit convoluted, his basic idea is that the proof for God lies within our own minds. Anselm suggests that we don't need to look beyond our own souls for truth about God; instead, the existence of this being is self-evident. In essence, he's saying that we can't dismiss the notion of God without evidence, as it's a fundamental aspect of our inner selves. This concept of trusting in the unproven is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\nOn the other hand, St. Thomas Aquinas takes a more empirical approach. He proposes that the existence of God can be proven using reason and evidence, eliminating the need for faith altogether. This idea would be beneficial for Christian evangelism, as it would allow new converts to be won over by logic rather than by blind faith. Aquinas develops five distinct logical arguments in support of God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Through each, he demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the inherent logic of his existence. If you're told you're missing a puzzle piece, assembling the rest of the puzzle reveals the features and existence of the missing piece without needing to see it in person.",
            "About 2,500 years ago, a young prince who would eventually be known as the Buddha was born. As his life unfolded, he chose a path that led him away from the world and into enlightenment. His teachings then gave rise to Buddhism, the foundation of which is Theravada Buddhism, the most traditional of its kind. Over time, Buddhism has evolved, transforming in both its surface-level practices and its core principles. This evolution is evident in countries like Sri Lanka, where the Theravada community observes the water-cutting ceremony. This annual event, which has acquired significant spiritual meaning, was never explicitly mentioned by the Buddha. Differences like this permeate Buddhism, extending from its external rituals to its fundamental teachings. Both within the monasteries and outside, the Theravada community has had to adapt its doctrine to changing circumstances. This has been influenced by a mix of both internal and external forces, some of which are benevolent, while others are hostile.\n\nBefore we dive deeper, let's clarify some key terms. Throughout this discussion, we'll refer to internal forces as those originating from within the Buddhist community, regardless of the individual's monastic status. External forces, on the other hand, come from outside the community. A hostile force is one that seeks to harm or undermine Buddhism, while a benign force is one that does not intend to cause harm but may inadvertently do so. These definitions will be crucial as we explore the complexities of Theravada Buddhism.\n\nTo better understand the core of this ancient faith, let's examine its fundamental principles. Buddhists seek refuge in the three jewels of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is comprised of the Tripitaka – the three baskets of sacred texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. These concepts include Anatta (no eternal self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these principles is key to escaping the cycle of death and rebirth, known as Sansara, and ultimately breaking free from the bonds of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka provides a set of guidelines for living, including the five precepts for laypeople (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not engage in immoral behavior, and I shall not consume intoxicating substances). Monks, on the other hand, must adhere to a more extensive set of rules. At the heart of Buddhism lies the four noble truths: Dukkha (life is suffering), the root cause of suffering is attachment, and suffering can be overcome.",
            "It's hard to believe it's been over a century and a half since the United States and Mexico were locked in an epic rivalry that lasted for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893.  The turning point of this longstanding feud was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the US came out on top, claiming Texas and the American Southwest as its own.  The conflict was a series of back-and-forth battles that didn't subside until just before World War I.\n\nAt the heart of this rivalry were deep-seated differences over faith, culture, and tradition.  As David M. Pletcher pointed out, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting American diplomatic headaches\" (1977, p. 41).  Our southern neighbors may have been the only two countries to consistently give the US a hard time, thanks to their proximity and the complex history between our nations.  In fact, other Latin American countries have generally enjoyed a more harmonious relationship with the US.\n\nThe issue of religion played a significant role in the rift between the US and Mexico, much like it has throughout history.  As Sally Frahm noted, \"If Americans opposed fascism and communism in the 20th century, they opposed Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries\" (2001, p. 86).  This wasn't just about differing ideologies; it was also about competing interests, with the two nations vying for what each deemed essential.  We inherited a legacy of distrust from our colonial past, and that made it tough to establish a smooth relationship between the US and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) counted no fewer than 17 disputes between the two nations during the 57-year rivalry period.  Most of these disputes revolved around territorial issues, including cross-border raids and frontier problems.  Border towns were plagued by bandits and outlaws, and it wasn't until both countries took a firmer stance on their borders that these problems started to subside.\n\nAs Schmitt (1974) explained, the rivalry slowly dissipated as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the US, and the US's goals shifted from expansion to economic intervention in Mexico.  And that's when the rivalry finally began to fade away.",
            "It's been fifteen years since my life took an unexpected turn due to an illness I had never heard of before. I was a nurse at the time, but it wasn't a career I had always dreamed of. Growing up, I was driven by the need for security and stability, hearing phrases like \"You'll always find work; people will always get sick\" echoing in my mind. So, I put aside aspirations of being a scientist or journalist to pursue a safer path. \n\nNow, at 46, I'm single, with little savings and unable to work, relying on Social Security Disability for survival. That's the reality I've faced for over a decade, with each passing day being a struggle to maintain security, safety, and self-respect. The one thing I'm certain of is that without the unwavering support of my family and close friends, I wouldn't be here today. When disaster strikes, it's not about being strong; it's about having people to rely on. \n\nMy point is that life is full of emergencies, big and small, and no matter how prepared we think we are, some challenges are too great to overcome alone. I agree that we need to stop putting all our trust in a faltering government, but I believe Americans should learn to trust and support one another instead of trying to go it alone. \n\nThe idea of rugged individualism, touted by Conservatives, is a myth. It was actually compassion, mutual respect, and sharing resources that helped our ancestors persevere in hard times. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies didn't make it to the coast by relying solely on themselves. \n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I've got a disaster kit stocked with essentials like first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and emergency materials. But while that's crucial, it's equally important to know your neighbors and build a support network. If you have the means, consider starting a small farm or investing in a wood stove, but don't forget the value of community.",
            "The age-old question persists: what drives organisms to evolve in the way they do? Are there underlying forces or constraints that steer the direction of evolutionary change? Despite D'Arcy Thompson's assertion in 1917 that even the simplest organic forms remained a mystery to mathematicize, we're still struggling to define them today. In recent years, researchers have begun to harness the power of mathematical modeling to shed light on the intricacies of mollusk skeletogenesis, exploring both ontogeny and phylogeny (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our study delves into how mathematical modeling, combined with experimental studies, can unravel the mechanisms governing the trajectory of evolutionary-developmental change in Prunum.\n\nTo achieve this, we've used X-radiographic images to identify quantifiable parameters that can be fed into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). These parameters have enabled us to create hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies, which we're now using to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. By integrating these results with experimental and descriptive studies, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying forces driving macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nWhen we consider a shell, we can think of it as a tube that navigates through 360 degrees of space over time. The individual coils or whorls of the shell are what give it its unique shape, spiraling around an imaginary central axis known as the columella. The rate at which these whorls expand can vary, and each one is separated by a continuous line called a suture. In most shells, the last whorl, or body whorl, is the largest, while the spire consists of all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire, and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal exits the shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed from various perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural (the latter orientation, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards, is often considered the standard view). A method for counting whorls involves viewing the shell from the apical perspective and identifying the first suture, which serves as a dividing line. Whorls are then counted from this line, with estimates made to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nBy tracing the path of the aperture through space and time, we can chart the trajectory of the shell's growth. This path can be graphically and mathematically represented, allowing us to manipulate the parameters and modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis. By exploring the intricacies of this process, we hope to shed light on the underlying mechanisms driving the evolution of Prunum.",
            "For the past decade, Indonesia has been stuck in a rut when it comes to neonatal and infant mortality rates.  Despite being on track to meet some of the Millennium Development Goals, such as water and sanitation targets, the country's progress in child and maternal health has been woefully inadequate.  The reasons for this stagnation are complex, but they point to a need to overhaul the entire health system rather than just implementing more programs.\n\nOne glimmer of hope is that Indonesia has made some progress in getting skilled healthcare workers to more births.  Now, 72% of births take place with a skilled professional present, which sounds impressive, but it's a mixed bag.  Many of these skilled workers are traditional midwives who lack the training to handle complications during delivery, which is a leading cause of maternal deaths.  In other words, these statistics are somewhat misleading and there's still a lot of work to be done.  Furthermore, there's been a disturbing trend of fewer children under five receiving medical treatment for diarrheal illnesses.  And to make matters worse, data on postnatal care is spotty and reveals a pressing concern, with low rates across the board.\n\nThe country's cesarian-section rates are also a concern, hovering around 4%.  What's even more alarming is that this rate is significantly lower in rural areas, where it's a mere 2%.  This disparity highlights the problem of unequal access to healthcare services, with urban areas getting the lion's share of care.  The issue of access isn't just limited to geographic disparities; there's also a significant gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest households, with a whopping 27% difference.  It's clear that the poor are already at a disadvantage when it comes to accessing healthcare due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nSo, what's the next step towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators?  The question is whether Indonesia should focus on developing program-specific approaches or strengthen its overall health system without prioritizing pre- and post-pregnancy care for mothers and babies.  While programmatic approaches may seem attractive, with their clear objectives and faster results, they come with some significant drawbacks.  One major concern is that investing heavily in one area can divert resources away from other critical areas, leading to a brain drain of human resources and duplication of services.  For instance, the influx of international funding for HIV/AIDS has actually hurt the family planning sector, highlighting the need to think about the broader health system rather than just tackling individual problems in isolation.",
            "Victorian novels are infamous for their meticulous attention to period-specific detail and aristocratic settings. However, two novels that deviate from this norm are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These works seamlessly blend mystery and the bizarre, traits uncommon in the period, thereby enriching their characters and offering profound insights into their motivations and emotions. This departure from the traditional Victorian formula adds depth to the narratives, making them more relatable and engaging.\n\nAs the narrative unfolds, the lines between reality and fantasy become increasingly blurred. In Oliver Twist, for instance, the protagonist's experiences are frequently presented through dreamlike sequences, which serve as a window into his inner world. These visions reveal Oliver's inner turmoil, his emotional pain, and his growing understanding of the harsh realities surrounding him. The infamous shooting scene in chapter 28 is a prime example of this. Oliver's vivid recollection of the event is more akin to a dream than a recollection, highlighting his loss of control over the events unfolding around him. The overwhelming pain and fear he endures are a testament to the dire circumstances he faces, leaving the reader to ponder whose hands are behind his misfortune. This raises questions about Oliver's agency and whether he's capable of controlling his own fate. As his sense of defeat grows, it becomes apparent that the influence of his harsh environment, particularly the manipulative Fagin, has taken its toll, rendering him powerless to act.\n\nIn a similar vein, Wuthering Heights employs dream sequences to explore the complexities of its characters. The passage from Dickens (220) illustrates the disorienting effect of these visions, where the boundaries between reality and fantasy are constantly shifting. The protagonist's perception of time becomes distorted, with days passing in an instant, and nights dragging on interminably. This blurred sense of time serves to heighten the sense of unease and desperation, leaving the reader questioning the nature of reality and the characters' place within it.",
            "‎ It was only a couple of years ago that I found myself in a peculiar situation as an after-school tutor for elementary school students. I was tasked with helping them excel in whatever subject they struggled with, but my strengths lay in English and reading. One student in particular, a boy named Adrian, caught my attention. He was in third or fourth grade, and his reading troubles were quite puzzling. Some letters he could pronounce with ease, while others not at all - it was as if he was speaking a different language. Given his Latino background, I initially assumed he might be struggling with the language barrier, but he spoke perfect English. As I tried to assist him, it dawned on me that something was amiss. That's when his mother walked in, and I realized the truth: Adrian's problem was not with speaking English, but with understanding the English alphabet. We communicated in broken Spanish, with my own limited proficiency, but the moment of clarity hit me like a ton of bricks - the boy could read just fine, but was struggling with the fundamentals of the English language.\n\nI share this story to highlight the often-overlooked issue of the language barrier in schools, particularly in California. It serves as a reminder that the problem is not always as straightforward as we assume. Even for a child who speaks perfect English, reading can be a daunting task. It's an issue that everyone acknowledges, but the real question is: what can we do about it?\n\nAdrian's case was relatively simple to address - he needed additional tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for the many children who barely speak English, the solution is far more complex. No single approach will suffice - not dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutors, or ESL classes alone. Instead, the key lies in combining these methods to create a comprehensive solution.\n\nThe dual language system is an excellent approach not only for children whose first language is Spanish but for all students. Research has shown that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Many people fear that this approach is a waste of resources and that most students won't benefit, but this is a misconception. If implemented as the norm, rather than the exception, all students would benefit from it. So, how can we make this a reality? Do we expect every teacher to be bilingual? No, that's unrealistic and impractical. However, we can have bilingual assistants, tutors, or aides to support students and teachers alike.",
            "We're often told from a young age that there's something greater than us, something we can't fully grasp. While some of us attend Sunday school or temple, others search within themselves for answers. Many accept the faiths passed down by our parents, but some reject them entirely, believing our personal universe is all that exists. We navigate our way to self-discovery through our unique perspectives on spirituality, desperately seeking a guiding light in the darkness. \n\nMy dad and I sat on the porch, listening to the rain, as he gazed into the downpour. His thin frame and sparse hair made him seem almost fragile, and his distant stare made me feel alone. I couldn't bring myself to talk about how much I'd miss him, fearing it would make the reality even more painful for both of us. I hugged him, moved closer, and shared his silence as we watched the rain fall.\n\nMy dad passed away in December, five days after my 22nd birthday, despite the chemo and radiation treatments that prolonged his suffering. I couldn't understand the point of it all. In that dark night, I didn't pray; I'd lost faith in a God who seemed to have stopped listening a long time ago. \n\nI didn't want to witness his final moments, so I avoided it.

            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" is often considered a paradox, a blend of the old and the new, as Ian Watt so aptly described it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been simultaneously praised and criticized, accused of lacking depth and yet admired for its ability to evoke the 'terrible sublime' (Burke). At its inception, the \"Gothic Novel\" genre was a fusion of elements from both 'ancient' and 'modern' romances, as Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto so cleverly demonstrated. Walpole's innovative work combined outdated theatrical elements with the modern novel's emphasis on character psychology, creating a unique literary style he dubbed \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre drew heavily from medieval theatre, architecture, and traditions, often incorporating them in unexpected ways. When The Castle of Otranto was first published, the term 'gothic' was already used to describe various styles, periods, and cultures, often with negative connotations – seen as old-fashioned or unsophisticated in comparison to the modern era. The marriage of these contrasting elements is what allowed the Gothic genre to endure and remain both nostalgic and fresh to readers across time.\n\nOne of the key ideas driving the Gothic Novel is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval ideals of knighthood, as exemplified by the process of training a knight, were not only retained but also reinterpreted in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry held significant importance for Gothic writers like Walpole because it represented a timeless ideal: the brave, honorable, and competent knight. Through the use of chivalric themes and language, the 'gothic past' became an idealized and romanticized era, hinting at the future evolution of Gothic into Romanticism. This nostalgia was likely a reflection of Walpole's own experiences during a time of social and political turmoil. As he wrote The Castle of Otranto, he was immersed in the turmoil and likely felt a sense of disillusionment with the present society, perceiving it as lacking the moral values and goodness of the 'gothic era.' This sentiment is evident in characters like Frederic, who embodies the chivalric ideals: he's a prince, a figure of tragedy, and a supposed hero, all of which are conventionally chivalric images. However, Frederic's character also showcases an excessive, exaggerated version of the gallant knight, introducing the trope of excess that would become a hallmark of the Gothic genre (66).",
            "We've all seen the intricate web of the supply chain unfold before our eyes, a complex dance of goods moving from customer demand to raw materials, production, and distribution. The term \"supply chain management\" was first coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who described it as the master plan of planning, implementing, and controlling each step to deliver what customers want, exactly when they want it. At its core, supply chain management is a delicate balancing act - a symphony of processes that require precision and timing to keep the customer satisfied.\n\nThere are six key players in this grand symphony: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Skilled managers use these elements to create a harmonious flow of goods, ensuring that customers receive the best possible service. Each step in the supply chain is crucial, and one misstep can lead to chaos.\n\nProduction is the foundation upon which the entire supply chain is built. It's where the \"when, why, where, and how\" of product creation is decided. Managers must tap into the market to understand customer needs, and once they do, they can decide what products to produce, how many to produce, and where to produce them - all while keeping customer demand and satisfaction in mind. Every detail counts, from production scheduling to equipment maintenance, as even the smallest miscalculation can lead to costly delays or inefficiencies.\n\nFor instance, my own experiences working at retail giants like Wal-Mart and Target taught me the importance of having a clear, step-by-step approach to every aspect of the business. From employee uniforms to receiving shipments, having a solid plan in place helps prevent confusion and ensures a smooth operation.\n\nSupply is the second key element in the supply chain equation. It involves making strategic decisions about a company's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships.

The film star stands alone on a street corner, the unsettling message scrawled on her makeshift sign in bold letters. The phrase is a powerful reminder of the struggles unfolding in Myanmar, a Southeast Asian country under the iron grip of a ruthless military junta. The regime seized power in 1962 through a coup d'état, and its authoritarian rule has been marked by brutal suppression of dissent.\n\nIn 2007, a wave of street protests shook the country, earning the name \"The Saffron Revolution\" due to the colorful robes worn by the Burmese monks who led the movement. While the initial protests were peaceful, the government's response escalated into a violent crackdown, with military forces invading and ransacking monasteries across the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned, and a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was tragically killed for simply witnessing a street protest. The official death toll was 13, but Colonel Hla Win, a former army officer, revealed a darker truth: \"Many more people have been killed in recent days than you've heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.\"\n\nThis is not a new phenomenon. Throughout history, governments have sought to maintain control over their citizens, crushing dissent and opposition with an iron fist. The early Roman emperors claimed divine right to rule, while Japanese emperors were believed to be gods, sent to guide their people to prosperity. Even our modern-day leaders have been known to engage in questionable practices, such as President George W. Bush's secret conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of a fringe group with a questionable agenda.\n\nWe see echoes of these tactics in infamous events like the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, where Chinese students and intellectuals were brutally suppressed, with estimated death tolls ranging from 200 to 3,000. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups and the government systematically killed thousands of Tutsis and moderates, is another stark example. And of course, there's the infamous \"Third Reich,\" where Hitler's regime perpetrated one of the most heinous crimes against humanity, targeting Jews and other minority groups.",
            "Duke Ellington’s enduring impact on jazz can be attributed in large part to his remarkable longevity and corresponding ability to shape his orchestra over time. Although his piano presence is subtle in many of the selected compositions, as a composer Ellington excelled at crafting intricate pieces that showcased the unique talents of each band member. He carefully constructed the framework for soloists to improvise within, while also writing tightly orchestrated passages that highlighted the distinctive styles of individual musicians. This approach allowed him to emphasize the overall tone of the orchestra, creating cohesive and original sounds for each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound and how they blended together in the ensemble enabled him to write some of the most groundbreaking and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\n\nA notable example of Ellington’s innovative approach is Creole Love Call, which showcases his use of voice as a jazz instrument throughout his career. This 12-bar blues piece, featuring six choruses, demonstrates Ellington’s ability to complement the styles of his soloists. The song begins with a smooth, melodic voice, gradually transitioning to a rougher sound towards the end. The following choruses feature a muted trumpet solo, a sweeping clarinet solo, and a full-band echo of the first chorus, each emphasizing different elements of the melody. The climactic final chorus features the reeds taking the lead, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections. The return to the first chorus structure in the final section sees the voice adopting the \"growl\" technique, soloing as an instrument. This innovative use of voice as a tone color adds a rich dimension to the piece.\n\nEllington’s use of voice in Creole Love Call is emblematic of a recurring stylistic trait throughout his work. In Hot and Bothered, he combines his skill in tight orchestration with his ear for tone color, achieving a rich and complementary sound through a call and response phrase between Bubber Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing. This approach is further explored in It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing), where Ellington utilizes Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "I'd been plagued by a nagging feeling for as long as I could remember - this maddening need for something that always seemed to elude me. It began when I was 14, at the height of my teenage angst. Three years later, at 17, the yearning was still there, only now it had evolved into a desire for connection, for someone to share my life with. Yet, despite the attention from various suitors, none of them had ever really captured my interest. I spent countless hours grappling with this enigma, trying to pinpoint the source of my unique affliction. Theories abounded, but nothing ever seemed quite right. So I continued to navigate life, forever questioning my desires.\n\nMy days at home were usually a tranquil oasis, a refuge from the world outside. My parents were a picture of serenity, rarely arguing with each other, and even less so with me. They did, however, occasionally clash with my independent streak, which they saw as a desirable but occasionally troublesome trait. I suppose it's no surprise, given their calm nature, that I, on the other hand, was a whirlwind of energy and curiosity, a combination that made me likable and endearing to those around me.\n\nBut today was different. As I wandered from room to room, searching for inspiration, I was jolted by the sound of my mother's anguished cry from the kitchen. I rushed in, panic rising as I asked, \"Mom?! What's wrong?!\" I saw her lying on the floor, writhing in pain, her voice strained as she gasped, \"Ow...sweetie, I...need you to take me to the hospital.\" I rushed to her side, putting a reassuring hand on her shoulder. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to pick you up.\" My mother directed me, her words clipped and urgent, and I could sense the severity of her pain. With my training in self-defense, I scooped her up, placing her gently in the backseat, and drove her to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital's antiseptic smell and air of concern were a far cry from the peaceful atmosphere I was used to, but I was too preoccupied with my mother's well-being to notice. I helped her onto the examination table, called out for the doctors, and watched anxiously as a team of professionals swarmed around us. My mother had taken a tumble off a step stool while reaching for a vase in the high cabinet.",
            "This study aimed to explore the relationship between adherence to the \"Mediterranean Diet\" - specifically the \"alternate Mediterranean diet score\" - and the risk of chronic heart disease and stroke.  The alternate Mediterranean diet is an offshoot of the Mediterranean diet, characterized by higher intake of plant-based foods, monounsaturated fats, and fish, along with lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate amounts of alcohol are also permitted.\n\nPast studies have shown that sticking to the Mediterranean diet reduces overall and cardiovascular mortality risk, and an intervention trial demonstrated that it's more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering bad cholesterol levels in obese individuals. However, these studies focused on mortality and weight loss, not specifically on stroke risk.\n\nThis epidemiological study tracked 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, who were part of the Nurses' Health Study - a long-term study of over 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. The researchers computed an alternate Mediterranean diet score six times between 1984 and 2004, using self-reported food frequency questionnaires that assessed participants' nutrient intake over the past year. An impressive 95% of the nurses remained in the study for the full 20 years. The diet scores were validated through various studies and verified against medical records, hospital reports, and death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, cases were considered \"probable\" and included - about 17% of all strokes and 24% of non-fatal heart attacks were classified this way.\n\nOther factors, such as body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use, were also calculated for each food frequency questionnaire. Starting in 1986, participants' leisure-time physical activity was also assessed.\n\nTo minimize random variation and better reflect long-term dietary habits, the researchers averaged the alternate Mediterranean diet scores over two prior years. Adjustments were made for potential confounders like age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing Cox proportional-hazard modeling, the researchers examined the link between the alternate Mediterranean diet score and the risk of heart disease and stroke, with separate models for fatal and non-fatal cases. The results showed that higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher alternate Mediterranean diet score, was associated with a lower risk of heart disease and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, there were 2391 cases of heart disease, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular deaths (fatal heart disease and strokes combined). Women in the top alternate Mediterranean diet quintile had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "The year 2007 marked the beginning of a severe economic downturn in the United States, with unemployment on the rise, the housing market in shambles, and several of America's largest corporations left reeling. The aftermath of this crisis still lingers, prompting a pressing question: what led to this calamity and how can we prevent it from happening again?  At its core, the financial disaster was born from a catastrophic mix of shortsighted and naive policy decisions that coerced banks and financial institutions into dooming themselves with reckless sub-prime lending. This reckless lending was fueled by a woefully underdeveloped financial infrastructure, which was further exacerbated by the government's pressure on Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) to take on these flawed mortgages and repackage them into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the destructive cycle began, with banks and financial institutions transferring the chaos onto the very mortgages they had sold, and ultimately, onto the entire economy.\n\nLooking back to the Clinton era of 1999, the roots of this crisis began to take shape. President Clinton sought to bolster his popularity ahead of his re-election by easing lending restrictions, thereby setting the stage for the sub-prime crisis that would unfold seven years later. In a 1999 New York Times article, Steven Holmes astutely noted, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, was under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand its mortgage lending to low- and moderate-income individuals, while also pushing to maintain its impressive growth in profits.\" Holmes's warning was eerily prescient: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may struggle in times of economic downturn, necessitating a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As we now know, this ill-conceived lending strategy would ultimately lead to the economic meltdown.\n\nSeveral factors converged to send the economy into a tailspin, including the proliferation of complex mortgage structures such as adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These innovations served to further entangle various sectors of the economy with the housing market, leaving U.S. households and financial markets precariously exposed to even minor fluctuations in housing prices. The housing bubble inevitably burst, leaving financial institutions that had invested in mortgage-backed securities reeling. By 2007, the top five U.S. investment banks collectively held an astonishing $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, accounting for approximately 30% of the country's GDP. The aftermath was brutal: Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at fire-sale prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to adapt to a life of intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie, staggering under $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, the infamous exposition - that pesky chapter in your story where you take a deep breath, stretch your writing wings, and either dazzle or bore your readers to tears.  Dr. Merlin has been known to let out a frustrated groan at her computer screen when she finds herself lost in a sea of unnecessary details, and not the exciting kind either.\n\nExposition isn't exactly your best friend.\n\nYou've likely heard the age-old writing tip: \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still falls into the trap of lengthy passages that leave the reader wondering when the actual story will start.  Exposition is that nagging voice in your ear, urging you to get the backstory out of the way so you can move on to the juicy parts (not to be confused with the other voice whispering in your ear to share every single detail about each character's childhood).\n\nIn its simplest form, exposition is when you spell out the details of what happened, often in a straightforward style.  In film, it's the scene where one character spews out a bunch of information to another, à la \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, it's often the author doing the telling.\n\nLet's examine an example.  Imagine you're reading a story where you're told that the heroine met her beloved at a certain time and place, they had a lavish wedding, and her husband was tragically murdered before her eyes.  You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to take up two pages, with only a couple of lines of dialogue from each of them.  You'd expect the author to delve deeper into the husband's character, showcasing his devotion through his words and actions, and you'd also expect to see the heroine's transformation through small, telling moments that reveal how much his presence enriched her life.  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally invested in his fate and gain insight into the heroine's character: what drew her to him, the depth of their connection, and clues about her thoughts, values, and dreams as reflected through his eyes.  You'd mourn his loss alongside her, deepening your connection to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you'd want more substance behind the bare bones of the plot: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, it's your job to provide that depth.  Sometimes, it's tempting to rush past certain things.  You might introduce a new character, mentioning that he used to be in the Air Force, works as the night manager of a gas station, has been married twice, has no kids, enjoys fishing on weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I tuned into the local news from Columbus, Ohio, watching the NBC 4 broadcast on August 13, 2011. The morning's lead story was a live report about a disturbing incident in Ashley, Ohio, where a man named Shad Hostettler had allegedly stabbed his wife. Although her name wasn't mentioned, I was shocked by his mug shot, which seemed to convey an aura of malevolence. The news team devoted a relatively brief two minutes to this developing story, providing only the bare essentials – multiple stab wounds and an arrest. I think they struck the right balance.\n\nThe next story covered an early morning shooting in the Sharon Woods area, which had left 18-year-old Travis Buyers critically injured. The SWAT Team was investigating, but no arrests had been made, and no suspects were identified. This report felt truncated, and I couldn't help but speculate that the reason might have been the victim's racial background. I've noticed this phenomenon before – that the media often glosses over crimes committed against minorities. In contrast, when a white child or adult is a victim, the news coverage is inevitably more extensive. \n\nThe news then shifted to the discovery of a gunshot hole in a Med-Flight helicopter. Details were provided about the estimated location of the incident, and it was determined that a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle was responsible. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for any information leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nI was also treated to a brief weather forecast, which warned of rain and thunderstorms on Saturday afternoon. Although the temperatures were expected to remain in the mid-to-low eighties for the weekend, the report felt rushed, almost like a teaser to keep viewers engaged.\n\nThe news also covered a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The perpetrator was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt, standing at around six feet tall and weighing approximately 150 pounds. I found it striking that the news team spent an unusual amount of time emphasizing his racial characteristics and skin tone.\n\nFinally, I came across a story about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin who had been found guilty of conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. What caught my attention was the unusual way the news team presented his sentence – 300 months rather than 25 years. I'm not sure if they thought this sounded more severe or if it was just a stylistic choice. They also highlighted Rodriguez's Hispanic heritage, which seemed inconsequential to the story itself.",
            "There's an unshakeable connection between brothers – a bond that's both beautiful and brutal, full of contradictions. This complicated link is woven with threads of love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. Brothers have a unique understanding of one another, a sense of kinship that surpasses all other relationships. When they gaze at each other, they catch glimpses of themselves, unfiltered and raw. It's during life's darkest moments that the true nature of this bond is laid bare, revealing both its beauty and ugliness. The consequences of this complex web of emotions can be overwhelming, but they're an essential part of the fraternal experience. When you lock eyes with a brother and see your own reflection staring back, you're confronted with the truth – not the way others see you, but the truth of who you are. It's in the actions you take and the repercussions that follow that your character is truly revealed.\n\nIn James Hurst's poignant short story, \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" we're given a glimpse into this intricate bond between two brothers. Set against the vibrant backdrop of a lush landscape, their doomed journey unfolds, marked by the clash of bitter disappointment and intense pride in a pivotal moment. Only one brother emerges alive, leaving behind a trail of questions and reflections. Through the protagonist's characterization and his interactions with his brother, Doodle, as well as the narrator's insightful perspective, we're shown the depth of their emotions and the world around them. These factors heavily influence the protagonist's actions, driving him towards a tragic fate.\n\nAt the heart of the story lies the protagonist's all-consuming pride. From the moment he begins to take his little brother on adventures to their fateful, final excursion, he's harbored a deep-seated resentment towards Doodle. He'd envisioned a brother who could keep up with him, sharing in the joys of physical activities like holding his breath, running, and climbing vines in the swamp. He wanted a partner to explore the world with, someone to share in the excitement of racing to the landing and perching in the top of the pine tree. But Doodle's fragile heart made these dreams impossible, leaving the protagonist with a crushing sense of disappointment. He even entertains the thought of suffocating his brother, a revelation that speaks to the complexities of his own psyche. Yet, his resolve crumbles when Doodle smiles at him, revealing a glimmer of love that's been lurking beneath the surface all along. This tender moment humanizes the protagonist, showing that his conviction wasn't as strong as he thought.",
            "Our minds are incredibly complex, information-processing machines. Over time, our understanding of the brain has evolved, and so have the metaphors used to describe it. We used to compare it to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, a book, and most recently, a computer. But as we delve deeper, we realize that these comparisons have limitations, and could lead us down a path of misconceptions.\n\nInformation trickles into our brains through our senses, transformed from physical stimuli like touch, heat, light, and sound into electrical signals. As this information bounces around in our brains, it's processed in two distinct ways: bottom-up and top-down. When I look at a picture of a black box on a white background, my brain starts by identifying the simple details, like color and orientation, and builds from there to conclude I'm looking at a box. But then, my brain uses its prior knowledge to speed up the process, identifying it as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole.\n\nOnce our brains have processed information to some extent, we have to decide what's important and what can be ignored. An attention filter kicks in, prioritizing signals and deciding which cognitive processes get access to the information. For instance, I can process every blade of grass when I'm looking down, but a healthy attention filter keeps me from noticing them individually. On the other hand, I can pick out my own name in a noisy room, even if it's not the loudest sound.\n\nThere are multiple stages to information processing, and our brains modulate the results at each stage, using attention to refine and prioritize. Before our brains can process information, it first needs to be stored. There are three main types of memory: sensory, working, and long-term. When information enters our brains, it's encoded, a process that varies depending on the type of sensory input. For written words, this might involve analyzing their structure, sound, or meaning.\n\nOnce information is stored, it needs to be maintained. Research on animals suggests that working memory, which stores information for about 20 seconds, relies on an electrical signal looping through specific neurons for a short period. Long-term memory, on the other hand, is thought to be stored in the structure of proteins.\n\nDifferent theories exist about how our brains organize knowledge, each drawing from psychology, computer science, and neurophysiology. One such model, the semantic network, proposes that concepts are represented by nodes, linked together based on their relatedness. For example, if I think of a chair, it might be connected to the concept of a table, which could be linked to wood, and so forth.",
            "Aldous Huxley's dystopian novel Brave New World paints a stark picture of a world where technology and a capitalistic system have created a society where individuality is suffocated and people are conditioned to prioritize immediate gratification above all else. The community takes precedence over the individual, with citizens molded from birth to crave instant happiness and obedience. But scratch beneath the surface, and you'll find that these people are mere pawns in a larger game, their lives dictated by the World Controller's iron-fisted ideology. A Marxist lens reveals Huxley's deep-seated suspicions about the impending dangers of these systems, with terms like homogeny and reification echoing through his narrative like a warning bell.\n\nThrough the lens of Marxist theory, particularly the concept of false consciousness, Huxley skewers capitalism's manipulation of the common folk. People are kept in the dark about their true place in the economic hierarchy, too busy chasing their own self-interest to notice the strings being pulled from above. The lower classes, Delta, Gamma, and so on, are conditioned to crave, consume, and indulge, their willpower subverted by the hypnotic power of hypnopædia. The World Controller pulls the strings, orchestrating this spectacle of consumerism with an iron fist. Hegemony, the notion that certain groups dominate others, is writ large in this dystopian world, where the lower classes are oblivious to their exploitation, buying into an ideology that reinforces their oppression. The upper classes, meanwhile, are either born with the knowledge or acquire it early on, but they do little to challenge the status quo, content to occupy their place in the hierarchy.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships between individuals are shallow and superficial. Characters lack depth, and even among the main characters, their interactions are one-dimensional. Huxley may be suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism has drained humanity of its free will and emotional expression. Love, passion, and genuine human connection are absent, replaced by surface-level interactions that reduce people to mere objects of desire. The societal classes' complacency with their roles in the hierarchy is a testament to the effects of capitalism, where people are told they're superior as long as they consume, obey, and conform to the norms of their peers.",
            "It's been nearly three years since I enrolled at University Park, and I've found that navigating the campus has become a major challenge. For many of us, including myself, getting from one place to another can be a real headache. My freshman year, I was stuck in an East Halls dorm room - the farthest outpost on campus, with the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center being the only structures beyond it. With classes scattered throughout the campus, including far-flung spots like the Willard building near the center, traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to those destinations could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially when the weather turned nasty. I recently spoke to a fellow alum who's not much older than me, and they shared that not too long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the university by vast tracts of undeveloped land. That vacant space has since been transformed into sports fields, sleek new buildings like the Creamery and health services building, and apartment complexes. As the campus continues to expand, it's getting increasingly difficult to get from one place to another.\n\nI had a conversation with a friend who'd recently dusted off their bike after a several-year hiatus, and they expressed their surprise at how much they'd missed it. \"Bikes are the way to go,\" they said. \"For a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Not only is bicycling great exercise, but it's also the most efficient way to travel. You can cover 30 miles or more with just a bowl of oatmeal and some physical exertion. I've since moved off campus, just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I made this year was buying a bike. With classes in Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from my home, bike-riding has shaved off 20 minutes from my daily commute. However, Pollock Road is the most direct route to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always the easiest road to navigate, bike or not. There are some advantages to walking, but personally, I'm too busy to walk every day. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option, and it would take about 30-40 minutes to get to Thomas building. That's over two and a half hours a week - a significant chunk of time I just can't afford to waste."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "I've always felt a deep desire to make a positive impact on the lives of others, particularly children who have been dealt a rough hand. As I pursue a degree in social work, I'm drawn to the Division of Family and Children Services, where I can be a source of comfort and support for those in need. At the heart of my approach are several core values: a commitment to service, respect for those I serve, and an unwavering dedication to ethics. I believe in striving to improve relationships between individuals and families, while also continually honing my skills to stay ahead in the field. These values aren't just professional ideals; they're deeply ingrained in my personal character.\n\nFor a long time, I was torn about my career path. I'd witness friends and classmates struggling with problems, and some would cope with unhealthy tactics. Those experiences led me to major in Psychology in college. Even with that degree, I still felt uncertain about my future. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break to figure things out. That's when my life took a dramatic turn. One summer, I visited a friend, and she introduced me to a 16-year-old boy who was visibly shaken. He was there to escape his abusive home life. The next day, I found out he'd called the police, and I decided to intervene. I drove to his parents' house, explained my concerns to the authorities, and shared my background as a recent Psychology graduate. The police asked me to speak with the parents, as they were at a loss for what to do. When I questioned the parents, they seemed evasive, making excuses for their son's actions. That encounter left a lasting impression on me, and I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help families resolve conflicts peacefully.\n\nSocial justice is another value that drives me in this field. We claim to value individuality, but our society often pressures people to conform. I've always been drawn to authenticity and self-expression. In high school and college, I made a point to challenge social norms: I dyed my hair bold colors, wore clothes that reflected my personality, got piercings that made a statement, joined the GSBA, and spoke out against racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it. I believe in fighting for what's right, and I'll continue to do so.",
            "As I delve into the realm of insomnia, I find myself entwined in the complex dance between biological and sociocultural models. The biological model peels back the layers, revealing the intricate web of genetic information and medical aspects that contribute to this sleep disorder. Conversely, the sociocultural model takes a step back, examining the environmental relationships that weave together race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review embarks on a journey to dissect these models, scrutinizing research that sheds light on the intricacies of insomnia and its underlying causes.\n\nInsomnia can be categorized into three distinct umbrellas: primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders tied to mental health, and sleep disorders linked to medical complications or substance intake. The primary sleep disorders are either Dyssonmias or Parasomnias. Dyssonmias, which include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, and others, are characterized by difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep. Conversely, Parasomnias, such as Nightmare Disorder and Sleep Terror Disorder, are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and physiological occurrences.\n\nAs I navigate the labyrinth of sleep disorders, I find myself questioning the role of genetics and physiology in the development of insomnia. Research has shown that neurons in the hypothalamus, specifically those containing orexin, play a pivotal role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice revealed that phenotypic GABAB receptors on these neurons are responsible for sleep-wake states. When the GABAA receptor is activated, it induces responses that promote sleep, while its inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and induced sleep. The findings suggest that the genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans may be linked to sleep regulation, and alterations in this receptor could disrupt sleep patterns. The sociocultural implications of this discovery are profound, highlighting the potential for inherited phenotypes to regulate sleep and the subsequent impact on daily life.",
            "Digging into Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), I found myself navigating three main areas: first, understanding the disorder itself; second, the process of diagnosis; and third, what teachers in a mainstreamed classroom can do to support students with CAPD.\n\n CAPD, or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is basically about the brain's ability to process what we hear. It's not about hearing loss, but rather the brain's challenge in deciphering, separating, and making sense of sound. People with CAPD can hear just fine, but their brain's internal messaging system, the central nervous system (CNS), can't quite keep up. They might pick up on individual sounds, but struggle to distinguish between different voices, conversations, or background noise.\n\nI stumbled upon the term \"auditory imperception\" in the 1950s, when researchers first identified it as a potential issue in kids with communication disorders. Since then, tests have been developed to help diagnose and understand CAPD. Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari started testing kids in 1954, and by 1961, Kimura introduced a new way of evaluating CAPD through dichotic testing. This sparked a wave of research, culminating in a national conference in 1977.\n\nCAPD presents itself in various ways. For some, it's difficulty pinpointing where sounds are coming from or distinguishing between multiple sounds. Others might struggle to recognize patterns or detect changes in speech, such as sarcasm. They might also get interrupted by one sound blocking another or struggle to piece together sound clues to make sense of them. Then there's the challenge of following the sequence of sounds.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD requires a thorough evaluation, often involving observation and tests administered by experts like audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and others. This might include questionnaires, surveys, and observing how the person responds to different sounds. There's no single, magic test that gets it right every time, and sadly, we still don't know what causes CAPD. Tests often involve presenting multiple sounds simultaneously and asking the individual to pick out specific items, like words or numbers. Some more advanced tests record sound waves within the ear and measure the brain's response.",
            "The play Twelfth Night suggests that donning a disguise can be an effective way to deceive others, but ultimately, it's a precarious game that can lead to losing oneself in the process. The problem with dropping a disguise is that it can lead to feelings of alienation, as one must then confront the consequences of their deception. This raises a difficult question: is it better to prioritize one's own self-preservation or the preservation of relationships with those around them? While some people might respond with indifference to being tricked, others may not take kindly to the deception, and their reaction can be anything but pleasant.\n\nThe idea of deception through gender role reversal is particularly complex, as it brings up a multitude of questions. One of the most pressing ones is, what drives someone to hide their true identity and adopt a disguise of the opposite sex? In the case of Viola, her decision is a desperate attempt to protect herself from harm: \"I'll take you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249). As a foreigner in a new land, Viola feels compelled to disguise herself as a man to avoid becoming a target. However, this ruse ultimately isolates her from the women around her, depriving her of a vital support system.\n\nViola's disguise is so convincing that Olivia becomes smitten with her, mistaking her for Sebastian: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138). Furthermore, Viola is forced to navigate her own suppressed desires for Orsino: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1.260-261). While this might seem like a progressive attitude to some, Twelfth Night can also be seen as a portrayal of how deception can facilitate the revelation of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages suggest that these characters may have unexpressed desires that are brought to the surface by Viola's disguise. For instance, is Olivia drawn to Cesario because of his masculine appearance, or does she secretly harbor feelings for women? Although it's unlikely that Olivia is genuinely attracted to women, her character can be seen as a satire of those who judge others based on appearance alone.\n\nThis is evident in the ease with which Olivia shifts her affections from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a romantic interest: \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315)",
            "The brutal nature of German colonial rule has been a subject of much discussion, particularly with regards to the atrocities committed against the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa.  But let's not get too hasty – the German colonial empire was a multifaceted beast with an array of policies and ruling styles as diverse as its geography. Educational provision across the colonies was equally varied, reflecting the complexities of this complex system. When the British took over German East Africa (now Tanganyika) in 1919, they encountered a surprisingly large population of educated and literate Africans, a stark contrast to the story of German colonial efforts elsewhere.\n\nIn particular, the situation in South West Africa – present-day Namibia – stands out as a jarring exception. Unlike East Africa, where the government took an active role in educating the native population, in South West Africa this responsibility fell largely to missionary societies, which received meager support from the government. Meanwhile, the government lavished significant resources on the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing a system of state schools and heavily subsidizing and regulating missionary schools. The effects of these policies persisted long after German rule had ended, leaving a lasting impact on South West Africa. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, here the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\n\nSo what explains this divergent experience of South West Africa? A range of social, economic, and political factors played a role, and I aim to shed more light on these in this paper. I'll focus particularly on fresh research into the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans, a topic that's been under-explored.\n\nThere's no shortage of literature on education in the German colonial empire, with much of it written in German during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. These early works tend to focus on describing the features of educational systems in the various colonies. Later studies, written in English, took a more comparative approach, examining education in the different German colonies and delving deeper into specific aspects of education. These studies revealed significant disparities in the educational systems of different colonies, with each one having its own unique flavor. One of the most influential works on this topic is Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies, highlighting the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa was a major factor in shaping the colony's educational system.\n\nThe German colonial territories in Africa presented a stark contrast in terms of climate, with South West Africa boasting a relatively mild climate, albeit with large expanses of arid desert. This relatively hospitable environment drew a significant number of European settlers – by 1913, nearly 15,000 whites called South West Africa home, compared to just 5,336 in East Africa, which had the next largest settler population.",
            "Over the last century, the landscape of popular music has undergone a seismic shift, branching into an array of genres that's become increasingly difficult to catalog. To make matters more complex, most, if not all, genres - think rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, and the like - have spawned a multitude of sub and sub-sub genres, each with its own distinct flavor. One genre that stands out as particularly diverse and expressive is Heavy Metal, which has evolved dramatically over the past 40 years to encompass a kaleidoscope of emotions, predominantly leaning towards the darker end of the emotional spectrum.\n\nHeavy Metal's flexibility has always been its defining trait, allowing artists to experiment and create their own sub-genres, which in turn have spawned an array of sub-sub-genres. As a result, the genre has become so diverse that it's challenging to pinpoint exactly what Heavy Metal is. It's a genre that has incorporated elements from other styles, yet its roots can be traced back to a singular movement.\n\nAt its core, Heavy Metal is a movement defined by its affinity for the darker aspects of life. It's a music of excess - more bass, more volume, more aggression, and more theatrics. Heavy Metal musicians are known for their technical prowess, evident in the complexity of their playing. Additionally, the genre has a long history of being closely tied to substance abuse, particularly in the 1970s, when a psychedelic drug boom led to the creation of unconventional, otherworldly music. The genre's visceral qualities, which often explored the darker side of the emotional spectrum, were a refreshing departure from the more lighthearted popular music of the time. Later generations of metal artists drew inspiration from the Romantic Era's dark, intense qualities, reflecting the genre's ongoing exploration of the human experience.\n\nLyrics like those found in Helter Skelter, a song often cited as one of the first Heavy Metal songs, exemplify the genre's affinity for the darker side of human nature. This song, penned by John Lennon, is a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier, darker sound, showcasing the Beatles' ability to create music that's just as intense. It's a testament to the genre's willingness to push boundaries and challenge conventions.",
            "Before the Surrealist artists set brush to canvas, painting their dreamlike masterpieces, the talented Henri Rousseau was crafting his own visions, quite literally. His 1910 work, The Dream, is a painting that's more than just a woman's enchantment with the wonders of a fantastical land - it's also a reflection of Rousseau's own dreams and aspirations as an artist. For years, he yearned for recognition, acceptance, and praise from his peers and art enthusiasts alike, but this desire came with a daunting challenge: should he conform to the art world's expectations or forge his own path and risk being unconventional?\n\nTo truly grasp the significance of The Dream, one needs to delve into Rousseau's remarkable life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in the French town of Laval, Rousseau's father was a prosperous businessman who enjoyed a comfortable lifestyle. Despite his comfortable upbringing, Rousseau himself received no formal art training, instead working as an employee of the municipal toll service until he was forty. He earned the nickname douanier, or customs inspector, but this moniker didn't capture the full extent of his talents. The loss of his first wife and eight infant children left Rousseau with only one child and a deep sense of sorrow, which he attempted to alleviate through painting. Unlike his contemporaries, who often romanticized the peasant in their art, Rousseau was a folk painter, driven by the hopes and dreams of the ordinary man.\n\nRousseau's obsession with being accepted by the art world was understandable, especially considering his late start and lack of formal training. He was producing art alongside some of the most talented and renowned modern artists of his time. It wasn't until around the same period that Matisse began building his reputation as an artist that Rousseau finally received the recognition he so desperately sought. Author Jan Gordon aptly pointed out the contrast between the two artists, noting that while Matisse aimed to avoid triteness in his work, Rousseau's goal was to create something so conventional that it would earn him acceptance into the Artiste Français.",
            "It's no secret that philosophers have long been fascinated by the intricate connection between ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. I firmly believe that there's a reason for this profound link. As John Keats beautifully puts it in his iconic poem \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty – That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Our understanding of the world is largely shaped by education and experience, but our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics seems to transcend these conventional paths. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe, rather than dictate. Our studies of morality and beauty are efforts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful or why an action is moral, rather than providing a set of rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nIn essence, criticism of art or morals can never fully capture the essence of what's great or beautiful. Analyzing the value of the Mona Lisa, for instance, might delve into aspects like composition, contrast, or cultural context, but these don't encapsulate why it's considered a masterpiece. When people discuss their favorite work of art or literature, they often start with a phrase like, \"There's just something about it,\" followed by a more in-depth explanation. I believe that both art and morals can't be reduced to a description of their qualities alone. As the inimitable Flannery O'Connor astutely observed, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way...You tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we examine the properties of a work of literature, there's an intangible quality that remains. I'm convinced that ethics shares this same property. As Wittgenstein insightfully notes, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" This \"something\" – this je ne sais quoi – is, in my opinion, the most powerful attribute of art and morality, and it provides a common ground between them.\n\nI believe that morality and art are deeply connected because we experience both at a profoundly personal level, to use a Kantian term. They impact us in ways that can be felt, but not fully explained. This connection is even more pronounced when it comes to literature. As McKean so eloquently puts it, \"What most distinguishes literature from other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values...Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "The Germany we know today is a powerhouse, a unified nation with its own unique cultural identity, spanning from the Alpine shadows of München to the Baltic Sea's shores in Kiel. The cultural thread that weaves through this vast land can be traced from Köln on the Rhine, through the heart of Germany, all the way to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. Given its rich heritage, it's no surprise that modern-day Germany has roots from a tapestry of different sources and tribes.\n\nThe cradle of Germanic culture is known as Germania, but the true origins of its name are shrouded in mystery. Some scholars point to the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe, as the source, while others suggest that the name might have derived from the Gauls' term for their neighbor. I find it fascinating to learn about the various theories surrounding the name's etymology. Julius Caesar's writings on the Gallic Wars offer a glimpse into the early use of the term \"Germanus,\" which he borrowed from the Gauls to distinguish between the conquered and unconquered tribes. In his commentary, Caesar notes, \"The Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they are continually waging war... They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC)\n\nWhile the name's true meaning remains uncertain, some theories propose that it might be related to the spear used in warfare, known as a \"ger,\" or the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" which could imply that the Germans were known for their loud and boisterous nature. The Roman historian Tacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" offers a captivating account of the Germans' origins, describing them as a people untouched by other cultures, with a unique identity that was not shaped by immigration or external influences. According to Tacitus, \"Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\" (Tacitus, 98)\n\nIt's intriguing to consider why the Romans, despite their conquests, never fully settled in Germania. Instead, they traded with the Germanic tribes, who offered their goods and skills in exchange for Roman hospitality. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they lived on the fringes of the Roman Empire, exchanging their wares and expertise for a place within the Roman army's ranks. This complex web of cultural exchange and trade laid the foundation for the Germany we know today, a nation with a rich tapestry of influences and a distinct cultural identity.",
            "As I stood there, my mind went blank, unable to grasp the scene unfolding before me. I stared unemotionally, disconnected from the moment, observing the world around me with a practiced detachment. Thoughts flitted through my mind, only to vanish as quickly as they appeared, leaving me with a sense of disconnection from my own thoughts. My consciousness was a smooth, unbroken flow, like a serene stream, with no distinct thoughts of my own, just a fluid experience of the world around me.\n\nI recall purchasing an art instruction book, 'The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,' after getting advice from a fellow artist. I'd always been fascinated by drawing since I was six, and this book promised to teach me the basics, from understanding the humble pencil to grasping how our brains interpret lines. One technique caught my eye: placing a frame around any picture to simplify its complexity. By doing so, a chaotic scene, like a still life of fruit on a table, could be reduced to a manageable, two-dimensional image.\n\nAt that moment, gazing down at the offending object in front of me, I couldn't mentally impose that frame. I was overwhelmed, awed, and unable to process the situation. If I had any aspirations of being an artist, this was the beginning of my masterpiece, the start of my story, titled 'Work in Brown.'\n\nMy hand instinctively reached for my tool of art, and I felt a surge of creative energy. Water flowed smoothly, crystal clear, and serene. Flakes of matter broke away, carried off into nothingness. But as my hand moved, muscles tensed and spasmed, and my hand struck the toilet handle for the second time. The stubborn, brown, unwanted package refused to budge, stuck like a slug on the toilet bowl.\n\nMop in hand, feet apart, and a green tie strangling my neck, I frowned, staring at the offending bundle left for the unsuspecting janitor at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more moments of introspection, and my hand reached for the toilet paper roll, began to wrap itself in toilet paper until it resembled a makeshift oven mitt. Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, I slowly dipped my hand into the bowl, a slow, deliberate movement like a mother preparing to retrieve the Thanksgiving turkey from the oven.",
            "The alarming statistics on teenage driving fatalities paint a somber picture - a deadly vector that's claiming lives behind the wheel. Several factors contribute to this disturbing trend, but one crucial aspect is the developmental stage of the teen brain, which is simply not equipped to handle the perils of driving. Inexperience is another major factor, not only leading to tragic accidents but also higher rates of rollover crashes, speeding, and driving off the road.\n\nThe teenage tendency to drive with peers is a recipe for disaster, and studies have consistently shown a correlation between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents. California and other states have tried to mitigate this issue by introducing temporary provisional licenses that restrict the number of hours teens can drive and prohibit minors as passengers. However, these measures are, in my opinion, mere Band-Aids on a festering wound.\n\nThe real issue lies in the fact that, statistically speaking, young drivers are not capable of adequately handling the risks and responsibilities associated with driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman has conducted research suggesting that even 18 is too young for a full driver's license, citing a common desire among those under 19-20 to engage in thrill-seeking behavior. It's logical, then, to delay driving until this tendency has subsided. If we continue to issue licenses to young teens, we risk seeing a devastating spike in fatalities, with potentially disastrous consequences by 2010 when the Baby Boomer generation's children will be hitting the roads.\n\nA relatively straightforward legislative solution exists. Schools could continue to offer driver's education classes to initiate the learning process, but no one under 18 should be allowed to operate a vehicle. A provisional permit could still be granted before a full license is issued, accompanied by a set number of practical training hours. The hours required could be based on existing state regulations, such as California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult. Uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable and effective means of protecting young drivers across the nation.\n\nThis proposal is not a novel idea, but it's a necessary step towards mitigating the staggering statistics on teenage driving fatalities.",
            "Browsing through the Library of Congress's archives of early Edison films, I stumbled upon a trove of trick films from 1895 to 1901, a total of fifteen mind-bending masterpieces. These films playfully exploit creative editing to create illusions that deceive and delight. My film study delved into the poetic elements that make trick films tick and analyzed the innovative leaps forward in a few of the later ones. At the turn of the century, trick films typically played out within the confines of a set-bound, frontal proscenium, featuring static cameras and sticking to a strict one-shot-per-film rule. However, as the century progressed, some filmmakers began to break free from these constraints by introducing novel techniques like multiple shots.\n\nOne striking commonality among trick films is their tendency to be set within the confines of a single interior scene, framed by a frontal proscenium. The camera remains steadfast in its position, refusing to follow figures or objects as they move. This composition, a staple of early cinema, drew its roots from the world of theatre and the vaudeville and magic acts that inspired it. The limitations of the stage-based setup resulted in figures moving horizontally within the frame, never venturing closer or further away from the lens. Take, for instance, the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where the actors enter from the right, moving back and forth along the horizontal axis, never straying beyond the camera's fixed frame.\n\nThe use of the frontal proscenium also led to a preponderance of long shots and, occasionally, medium shots, with close-ups being a rare sight. This adherence to traditional theatre and vaudeville conventions meant that the audience would see the entire performance at a given time, framed by the borders of the stage. In early films, actors rarely moved towards or away from the camera, making close-ups a non-existent phenomenon. Most trick films from the Edison catalog conform to the one-conceptual-shot-equals-one-film rule, restricting their length to approximately a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. This also limited the narrative and dramatic potential of these films, which generally focused on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic and disappearing acts, with little story to speak of. However, upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that one conceptual shot can be comprised of multiple physical shots, cleverly joined together to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance. The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) is a prime example, where a thorough examination reveals the precise moment where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the film is conceptually one shot in the viewer's eyes.",
            "I've always been intrigued by the story of John Taylor of Caroline, a man who embodied the spirit of Republicanism in its early days. As an agriculturalist by profession, his passion for the land and the values it represented shaped his views on personal freedom and government. His strong convictions on preserving the agrarian system underpinned his arguments on sovereignty, the Constitution, and the judicial system, often making him a vocal advocate for limited government and individual rights.\n\nTaylor believed that the United States had a unique opportunity to create a truly exceptional system of government, free from the constraints of traditional institutions. He was convinced that the declaration of natural rights, which he saw as interconnected and mutually dependent, should be beyond the reach of government. In his view, a government should acknowledge and balance the inherent duality of human nature, with its virtues and vices. He famously argued that, as government is exercised by humans, all its virtues and vices must be human as well.\n\nTo create an ideal society, Taylor proposed a government that would protect private property, promote agriculture, and discourage unchecked capitalism. He saw a well-founded government as one that would function equitably, despite the inevitable presence of self-interest and avarice in its administration. He believed that self-interest was a fundamental human drive, but it only became a problem when it led to the exploitation of others. A good government, he thought, was necessary to contain humanity's darker aspects and prevent the spread of bad principles.\n\nAs a staunch Republican, Taylor championed a strict construction of the Constitution, advocating for a limited federal government with only explicitly stated powers. He recognized that an expansive federal government was likely to be costly and tyrannical, yet he cautioned against a simplistic, literal interpretation of the Constitution, which could lead to corruption. For Taylor, the Declaration of Independence served as the true charter of the United States, providing a clearer vision of the country as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Looking back at Figure 17, I noticed a sudden and alarming drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. It was a bit disheartening and left me wondering what could have caused it. As the winter months rolled in at our New England campus, it's not a stretch to assume that the decrease in foot and bike traffic contributed to the decline. The end of the fall semester in December also brought a flurry of activity - students were finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and were probably too busy to bother with logging their commutes. The holiday season and subsequent month-long break didn't help, either - many students and faculty were on vacation, and the campus was eerily quiet. It wasn't until late January, with the start of the spring semester, that things picked up again, but even that didn't explain the low numbers for February. We had hypothesized that our project might experience a natural ebb in enthusiasm after the initial excitement wore off, and the Carpool Challenge Week campaign we launched in March was designed to combat this by injecting a burst of energy and enthusiasm. It worked, at least temporarily, as log submissions increased during that month. However, the bigger challenge we faced was how to maintain momentum amidst the natural fluctuations in engagement caused by semester breaks and holidays.\n\nAnother hurdle we encountered was the deeply ingrained cultural preference for driving one's own car. People love their independence and flexibility, and it's no wonder many were hesitant to give up their keys. To combat this, we tried offering prizes - gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, and bookstores - but it would have been interesting to see how bigger, more enticing prizes would have affected participation. For instance, giving away a brand new bike, hybrid car, or electric car might have been just the thing to boost engagement and combat that initial decline. We stuck with the same prize structure throughout the project, but if we had gradually increased the value of the prizes - announcing bigger and better prizes each month - it might have helped keep people engaged and motivated.",
            "I've recently found myself pondering the mystique of ETFs, or exchange-traded funds, and the benefits that come with them. Essentially, an ETF is a security that mirrors an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets, much like an index fund. But unlike its more rigid counterpart, an ETF offers flexibility and trades on an exchange like a stock, giving you the best of both worlds. On one hand, an ETF provides the diversification of an index fund and the perks of single stock ownership, such as the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and even purchase a single share in a transaction. However, these benefits come with a catch – the expense ratios of ETFs tend to be significantly lower than those of the average mutual fund.\n\nWhile ETFs may seem like the holy grail of investing, there are some downsides to consider. For instance, you'll need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just like you would on a stock order. Not to mention the overwhelming array of funds available, which can make it challenging to determine whether the benefits you're promised actually pan out. As a savvy investor, it's essential to scrutinize the benefits, such as diversification, and evaluate their true extent. In this investigation, we'll be taking a closer look at the ETF IHF and comparing it to its top 10 holdings to see if the benefits of owning a single ETF come close to replicating the benefits of a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks.\n\nTo simplify our analysis, we'll focus on the top 10 holdings, which account for a substantial 63.58% of the ETF's assets. By examining these holdings, we can gain a better understanding of how well they represent the ETF as a whole. To do this, we can calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming a portfolio composed entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportions established by the ETF. The results of these calculations are presented in the chart below.\n\nA quick glance at the chart reveals that a portfolio consisting only of the top 10 holdings would yield a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Moreover, the Beta of the top 10 holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF as a whole, suggesting that this portfolio may offer a higher return with a lower risk. However, it's essential to note that these results may not be statistically significant, and further analysis is needed to confirm our findings.\n\nTo determine whether these portfolios are statistically distinct, we'll examine the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100% for comparison with the ETF IHF's accumulated standard deviation. This will give us a better understanding of the level of risk associated with each portfolio and help us determine whether the differences we've observed are statistically meaningful.",
            "In the realm of Edgar Allan Poe's literary masterpieces, \"Dream-Land\" stands out as one of his personal favorites. This poem is a testament to Poe's fascination with the concept of Thulé, which he references twice in the work. Interestingly, the term \"Thulé\" was first introduced by the ancient Greek poet Virgil, who used it to describe an island located beyond the edge of the known world. However, there's another source that deserves recognition - Poe's affinity for German authors. Poe's admiration for the works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe is well-documented, and it's likely that he drew inspiration from Goethe's writing.\n\nThe connection between Poe and Goethe is significant, as it highlights their shared themes and ideas. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" notes the striking similarities between their works, suggesting that Poe may have been influenced by Goethe's poetry. The Oxford Companion to English Literature sheds more light on Goethe's works, including his celebrated poetic drama \"Faust,\" which was published in two parts in 1808 and 1832, respectively. Within the second part of \"Faust,\" there's a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé,\" which tells the story of a king who, after losing his wife, succumbs to grief and eventually dies.\n\nThe parallels between the King of Thulé and the narrator in \"Dream-Land\" are striking, with both characters grappling with loss and despair. Poe's use of Thulé as a recurring theme in his works, including \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" suggests a deeper exploration of the human experience. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe describes Thulé as a desolate and colorless world, haunted by the memories of the past. This eerie landscape echoes the King of Thulé's own desolate existence, as he mourns the loss of his beloved wife.\n\nGoethe's influence on Poe's work is further solidified by their shared connections to other notable authors, such as Alfred, Lord Tennyson. Poe's admiration for Tennyson is well-documented, and it's likely that he was exposed to Goethe's works through various reproductions and translations that were widely available after the original publication. The relationship between Poe and Goethe serves as a testament to the cross-pollination of ideas and influences that shaped the literary landscape of the 19th century.",
            "Can a customer who slipped and fell on an applesauce spill in a grocery store in California potentially win punitive damages if the store manager ignored two warnings to clean the spill and didn't act for half an hour because he was eating dinner?  It's likely that a judge won't dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim out of hand. To justify punitive damages, a plaintiff must show that the defendant's actions were a reckless disregard for the harm they could cause, and were truly despicable. Palmer can argue that the store manager, Martin, should have known the spill was a hazard because six people had slipped and fallen in the store in the months leading up to her accident, and still he didn't act. That's a pretty weak argument, but it's not entirely implausible given that Martin was informed about the spill twice, and still chose to ignore it while he had dinner.\n\nThe details of the case are pretty disturbing. On October 13th, an employee, Rich Wayne, told Martin about the spill at 5:00 pm, but Martin said he was too busy to deal with it. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary Haddigan, also warned Martin about the spill, but he still blew her off. It wasn't until 5:30 pm, when Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, that someone finally took action. It's not just this incident that suggests Martin didn't care about safety – five other people had slipped and fallen in the store in the same year. Palmer is now suing D&D for the injuries she sustained, and we're considering whether to ask the court to dismiss the claim for punitive damages.\n\nIn California, punitive damages are only available if a defendant has acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" The law defines malice as conduct that's meant to cause harm, or if not, conduct that's so despicable it shows a willful disregard for the rights and safety of others. A court has ruled that conduct is malicious if it shows a conscious disregard for the plaintiff's rights, especially when the defendant knows the harm that's likely to result from their actions. In this case, it seems like Martin knew the probable consequences of leaving the spill uncleaned, but chose to ignore them. That's not exactly the kind of behavior you'd expect from a store manager.",
            "It's been just shy of four years since I enrolled in a course on Islam at CBC. One question that consistently sparked heated debates in class was whether Islam is, in fact, a hostile religion. I think this topic has taken on even greater relevance in the years following 9/11. In retrospect, I've observed a shift in the way mass media portrays Islam, veering from an overwhelmingly negative stance to an extreme show of tolerance towards the faith in America. It's astonishing to consider that, in 2001, a presidential candidate with an obvious Muslim background, such as Barack Obama, would have been unimaginable.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad has piqued my interest due to the apparent disconnect between his historical persona and the character depicted in the biography. From what I've learned, I always thought Muhammad forced conversions to Islam, conquering tribes and imposing the faith upon them. However, the biography paints a very different picture of Muhammad, portraying him as a misunderstood martyr who humbled himself to others and patiently waited for people to seek him out after witnessing the \"truth\" in his teachings.\n\nWhat's striking to me is the uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the reported \"miracles\" of Muhammad. One notable example is the story of Muhammad multiplying mutton and milk to feed a group of forty men. The writing style used in these accounts makes me believe the authors were attempting to portray Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove anything, simply living in truth and experiencing miracles. This downplays the significance of Jesus' life and miracles, making it seem as though the authors are attempting to co-opt and profit from Jesus' legacy through Muhammad.\n\nFurthermore, many stories in the biography seem to be included to provide \"proof\" of the \"witness\" or the spontaneous conversion of people to Islam. However, I found this approach problematic, as a lot of these stories come from third-party accounts, often through a series of hearsay. This diminishes the stories and makes them seem even more suspicious.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this work is the attempted deification of Muhammad as a gentle, humble, wise, and endearing figure. Yet, historical records contradict this image, and I can't help but wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true history behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "As we look back at the foundation of Christianity, it's striking to see how quickly the teachings of Jesus were set aside in favor of the evolving ideas that shaped the faith after his time.  Taking a broad view of history, it becomes clear that Christianity has been gradually moving further and further away from its roots.  Yet, there's a growing sense of awareness and a progressive shift in today's world, which may signal a turning point.  While traditionalists will likely resist exploring beyond the established norms, their influence may wane as a more open-minded segment of the population gains traction.  In the years to come, Christians will increasingly seek a deeper understanding of their faith, distinguishing between the original intent of Jesus' message and the doctrines that have accumulated over time.  It's a process that may take centuries, but eventually, it's inevitable:  The trend of Christian history will reverse, and the faith will return to its original form.  A movement will emerge, peeling away the layers of dogma, layer by layer, as if the clock were rewinding, leaving only the essence of Jesus' teachings that he brought to humanity through God, untainted by the influences of later thinkers.  As this shift gains momentum in the United States and Europe, masses will be inspired to worship in a more authentic, unadulterated way, as if they were living in Jesus' time, following his ideas alone.  The church, as an institution, will remain a guiding force, but its teachings will become more uniform and less diverse, as differences between regions, denominations, and factions begin to fade.  History is replete with examples of reversals, like the transformation of the Roman Empire from a persecutor of Christians to a Christian institution, or the transition from African-American slavery to leadership.  The next great reversal will unfold within Christianity, a journey back to the source, where diversity is lost in the process.  A crucial aspect of this process will be to interpret Jesus' words as metaphors rather than literal statements.  So, let's examine the roots of Christianity:  If we dig deep into history, we find Judaism, the theological wellspring of the Christian faith.  By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were already central to Jewish thought.  Yet, the Jewish people were far from united, splintering into groups like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and ordinary folk.",
            "I believe that Upton Sinclair's The Jungle reveals the inherent self-interest and narcissism that lies within human nature. People are primarily driven by their own desires to improve their lives, without much concern for those around them. The novel masterfully illustrates this concept in various ways. The greedy factory owners and managers are the most obvious example. Their sole ambition is to expand their businesses and accumulate wealth, without regard for the consequences or any obstacles that may come their way. They carelessly disregard the harm caused by pollution, as evident in Sinclair's vivid description of the factories' pollution: \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". This potent imagery conveys the devastating impact of their actions on the environment and the people living nearby, who are exposed to the noxious fumes and unsanitary conditions of the factories.\n\nThe owners' disregard for their employees is equally appalling. They prioritize profits over people, as Sinclair notes, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They exploit their workers, forcing them to work long hours with little notice and zero compensation, and then cast them aside without a second thought when they're no longer needed. During the time period in which the novel is set, workers had little to no protection under the law, allowing the factory owners to run amok, pushing their employees to work faster and under harsh conditions. The novel implies that the workers were expected to accept these conditions without complaint, as there were no organizations or resources available to support them. Even the unions formed to represent the workers often ended up harming them more than helping, profiting off the misery of the poor. The workers were essentially treated as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "When weaving a narrative, authors often employ techniques to evoke a specific emotional response from their readers. Some methods prove more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald masterfully employs a variety of techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. He frequently pairs adjectives with nouns in unconventional ways to create an aura around a subject. At other times, he imbues a symbol with meaning, only to reuse it to convey a similar sentiment. Fitzgerald employs the latter technique with several colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, he builds associations for the colors white/gray, then later uses these connections to evoke a particular feeling in the reader when describing a significant object.\n\nFitzgerald skillfully constructs meaning for the colors white/gray, with white being associated with a more refined and upper-class tone, while gray is linked to something older and faded. He establishes this meaning early on in the novel by consistently using both colors. The characters of Daisy and Jordan are often \"in white\" (8), and, in fact, white is a ubiquitous color: Nick dons \"white flannels\" (41) to Gatsby's party, while Tom sports a \"white shirt\" (36) when he meets Myrtle. Catherine is even described as \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only exception to this is when Nick is describing his impressions of Gatsby's party: \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further reinforces these color associations by applying them to everyday, unremarkable subjects: when Nick commutes to work, he navigates \"the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the names of people at Gatsby's parties are now \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's schedule, and Catherine's apartment is likened to \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\" – a sense of uniformity (28). He also uses white or gray to describe ordinary people or places: Jordan and Daisy shared a \"white girlhood\" (19), there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" in the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nAfter establishing a strong connection between white/gray and uniformity/unimportance, Fitzgerald employs this color symbolism to convey a similar message about certain subjects. This begins with Daisy. Following a period of minimal use of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster\" (74), and readers start to perceive her as more of a uniform, almost interchangeable element, something Gatsby desires and longs for. Fitzgerald uses this technique repeatedly around Daisy to reinforce the idea that she is a more uniform addition, as seen in the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18) and her appearance in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County is the perfect place for a thriving agricultural operation, thanks to its incredibly mild and sunny climate. The region's rich soil and favorable weather conditions make it an ideal location for growing a diverse array of crops, including juicy tomatoes, succulent citrus fruits, leafy greens, squashes, broccoli, fragrant herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, luscious berries, sweet honey, and spicy peppers. With a growing demand for organic community-supported agriculture (CSA) programs, local farmers have a lucrative market to tap into, and many have lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also highly sought after, and innovative farmers are capitalizing on this trend. \n\nIn addition to the financial benefits, organic farming has a profound impact on the environment. By avoiding harsh chemicals, these farms become wildlife sanctuaries, boasting vibrant biodiversity and a healthier ecosystem. However, there are some trade-offs to consider. Organic farming requires more labor and management to maintain the soil and water quality without relying on chemicals, which can lead to higher costs and potential losses. Small organic farms also struggle with efficiency, lacking the scale of large industrial operations. To mitigate these challenges, landowners may seek financial assistance or expert guidance to maximize both profits and habitat quality.\n\nFor this hypothetical scenario, I've chosen a 160-acre property in unincorporated San Diego County, near the town of Potrero. This land is a unique blend of chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, situated next to the Cleveland National Forest. It falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which aims to protect over 100 species of plants and animals. Unfortunately, many of these species are endangered or declining, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher.\n\nThis land has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. The property was part of an original homestead patent, which likely meant it was used for grazing and/or wood production for many decades.\n\nTo better understand the possibilities and challenges of farming this land, I selected a real estate listing and researched government programs that could help mitigate costs and preserve wildlife-friendly operations. As a model for a small farmer in this area, I looked at an existing organic farm in the same region, striving to balance the needs of both people and the planet.",
            "The intricate dance of culture plays a pivotal role in any negotiation. But what exactly is culture? It's a complex entity that can be defined by what it's not as much as what it is, and what it signifies. Culture is not monolithic, nor is it a single, uniform thing. Reducing it to broad generalizations, such as \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating,\" can be misleading and overly simplistic. While understanding a culture's general characteristics can be helpful, it's far more productive to grasp the significance of that culture in the context of the negotiation and how it will shape the discussion. When navigating a foreign culture, we inevitably compare it to our own, and this can lead to a deeper understanding.\n\nDelving into a foreign culture or mindset requires a willingness to study its history, acknowledge its biases, and accept it for what it is. Rather than trying to change or judge a culture, it's essential to work within its boundaries, especially during negotiations, particularly when you're in a weaker bargaining position. When operating on \"away\" territory, respecting local traditions and beliefs can help break down cultural barriers and facilitate progress in the negotiation.\n\nCulture's scope extends beyond national or international boundaries. Companies within a country often establish their own distinct corporate culture, which can vary greatly. For instance, some companies value long working hours, while others prioritize a more relaxed schedule. This corporate culture is reflected in employee attire, communication styles, delegation of tasks, and hiring practices. Even within the United States, corporate culture differs significantly from company to company, and within companies, there's diversity from region to region and city to city.\n\nValues are crucial to grasp, as they provide the underlying motivations behind a culture. If saving face or maintaining communal harmony is a core value, a negotiator won't risk publicly embarrassing their company or superior. Conversely, a negotiator from a culture prioritizing hard-driven deals won't necessarily be eager to settle quickly. Considering these generalities is vital before sitting at the negotiation table, but it's also essential to learn about your opponent on a personal level to make the negotiation effective.",
            "A phrase often attributed to the Bible, \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God,'\" initially appears in Psalm 14, and it's also central to St. Anselm's argument on the existence of God. Thomas Aquinas shares a similar conviction. Since their arguments both defend the same concept, and our task is to determine which one is more compelling, we'll assume, for the sake of keeping things concise, that they're both correct in their faith in the God of the Bible. If we were to allow for a different conception of God, it would distort the comparison between their two arguments, as they're essentially in defense of a specific deity. \n\nLet's cut to the chase: both St. Anselm and St. Thomas Aquinas present valid points, but neither provides a comprehensive foundation for believing in God. To illustrate this point, let's dive into the core of St. Anselm's argument. In his writing, Anselm embarks on a journey of discovery through faith, seeking proof of God within one's own self. He posits that because we can't fully grasp the concept of God's nonexistence, it implies that God must exist within our understanding. While his explanation can be a bit convoluted, his basic idea is that the proof for God lies within our own minds. Anselm suggests that we don't need to look beyond our own souls for truth about God; instead, the existence of this being is self-evident. In essence, he's saying that we can't dismiss the notion of God without evidence, as it's a fundamental aspect of our inner selves. This concept of trusting in the unproven is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\nOn the other hand, St. Thomas Aquinas takes a more empirical approach. He proposes that the existence of God can be proven using reason and evidence, eliminating the need for faith altogether. This idea would be beneficial for Christian evangelism, as it would allow new converts to be won over by logic rather than by blind faith. Aquinas develops five distinct logical arguments in support of God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Through each, he demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the inherent logic of his existence.

            "About 2,500 years ago, a young prince who would eventually be known as the Buddha was born. As his life unfolded, he chose a path that led him away from the world and into enlightenment. His teachings then gave rise to Buddhism, the foundation of which is Theravada Buddhism, the most traditional of its kind. Over time, Buddhism has evolved, transforming in both its surface-level practices and its core principles. This evolution is evident in countries like Sri Lanka, where the Theravada community observes the water-cutting ceremony. This annual event, which has acquired significant spiritual meaning, was never explicitly mentioned by the Buddha. Differences like this permeate Buddhism, extending from its external rituals to its fundamental teachings. Both within the monasteries and outside, the Theravada community has had to adapt its doctrine to changing circumstances. This has been influenced by a mix of both internal and external forces, some of which are benevolent, while others are hostile.\n\nBefore we dive deeper, let's clarify some key terms. Throughout this discussion, we'll refer to internal forces as those originating from within the Buddhist community, regardless of the individual's monastic status. External forces, on the other hand, come from outside the community. A hostile force is one that seeks to harm or undermine Buddhism, while a benign force is one that does not intend to cause harm but may inadvertently do so. These definitions will be crucial as we explore the complexities of Theravada Buddhism.\n\nTo better understand the core of this ancient faith, let's examine its fundamental principles. Buddhists seek refuge in the three jewels of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is comprised of the Tripitaka – the three baskets of sacred texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. These concepts include Anatta (no eternal self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these principles is key to escaping the cycle of death and rebirth, known as Sansara, and ultimately breaking free from the bonds of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka provides a set of guidelines for living, including the five precepts for laypeople (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not engage in immoral behavior, and I shall not consume intoxicating substances). Monks, on the other hand, must adhere to a more extensive set of rules. At the heart of Buddhism lies the four noble truths: Dukkha (life is suffering), the root cause of suffering is attachment, and suffering can be overcome.",
            "It's hard to believe it's been over a century and a half since the United States and Mexico were locked in an epic rivalry that lasted for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893.  The turning point of this longstanding feud was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the US came out on top, claiming Texas and the American Southwest as its own.  The conflict was a series of back-and-forth battles that didn't subside until just before World War I.\n\nAt the heart of this rivalry were deep-seated differences over faith, culture, and tradition.  As David M. Pletcher pointed out, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting American diplomatic headaches\" (1977, p. 41).  Our southern neighbors may have been the only two countries to consistently give the US a hard time, thanks to their proximity and the complex history between our nations.  In fact, other Latin American countries have generally enjoyed a more harmonious relationship with the US.\n\nThe issue of religion played a significant role in the rift between the US and Mexico, much like it has throughout history.  As Sally Frahm noted, \"If Americans opposed fascism and communism in the 20th century, they opposed Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries\" (2001, p. 86).  This wasn't just about differing ideologies; it was also about competing interests, with the two nations vying for what each deemed essential.  We inherited a legacy of distrust from our colonial past, and that made it tough to establish a smooth relationship between the US and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) counted no fewer than 17 disputes between the two nations during the 57-year rivalry period.  Most of these disputes revolved around territorial issues, including cross-border raids and frontier problems.  Border towns were plagued by bandits and outlaws, and it wasn't until both countries took a firmer stance on their borders that these problems started to subside.\n\nAs Schmitt (1974) explained, the rivalry slowly dissipated as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the US, and the US's goals shifted from expansion to economic intervention in Mexico.  And that's when the rivalry finally began to fade away.",
            "It's been fifteen years since my life took an unexpected turn due to an illness I had never heard of before. I was a nurse at the time, but it wasn't a career I had always dreamed of. Growing up, I was driven by the need for security and stability, hearing phrases like \"You'll always find work; people will always get sick\" echoing in my mind. So, I put aside aspirations of being a scientist or journalist to pursue a safer path. \n\nNow, at 46, I'm single, with little savings and unable to work, relying on Social Security Disability for survival. That's the reality I've faced for over a decade, with each passing day being a struggle to maintain security, safety, and self-respect. The one thing I'm certain of is that without the unwavering support of my family and close friends, I wouldn't be here today. When disaster strikes, it's not about being strong; it's about having people to rely on. \n\nMy point is that life is full of emergencies, big and small, and no matter how prepared we think we are, some challenges are too great to overcome alone. I agree that we need to stop putting all our trust in a faltering government, but I believe Americans should learn to trust and support one another instead of trying to go it alone. \n\nThe idea of rugged individualism, touted by Conservatives, is a myth. It was actually compassion, mutual respect, and sharing resources that helped our ancestors persevere in hard times. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies didn't make it to the coast by relying solely on themselves. \n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I've got a disaster kit stocked with essentials like first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and emergency materials. But while that's crucial, it's equally important to know your neighbors and build a support network. If you have the means, consider starting a small farm or investing in a wood stove, but don't forget the value of community.",
            "The age-old question persists: what drives organisms to evolve in the way they do? Are there underlying forces or constraints that steer the direction of evolutionary change? Despite D'Arcy Thompson's assertion in 1917 that even the simplest organic forms remained a mystery to mathematicize, we're still struggling to define them today. In recent years, researchers have begun to harness the power of mathematical modeling to shed light on the intricacies of mollusk skeletogenesis, exploring both ontogeny and phylogeny (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our study delves into how mathematical modeling, combined with experimental studies, can unravel the mechanisms governing the trajectory of evolutionary-developmental change in Prunum.\n\nTo achieve this, we've used X-radiographic images to identify quantifiable parameters that can be fed into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). These parameters have enabled us to create hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies, which we're now using to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. By integrating these results with experimental and descriptive studies, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying forces driving macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nWhen we consider a shell, we can think of it as a tube that navigates through 360 degrees of space over time. The individual coils or whorls of the shell are what give it its unique shape, spiraling around an imaginary central axis known as the columella. The rate at which these whorls expand can vary, and each one is separated by a continuous line called a suture. In most shells, the last whorl, or body whorl, is the largest, while the spire consists of all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire, and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal exits the shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed from various perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural (the latter orientation, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards, is often considered the standard view). A method for counting whorls involves viewing the shell from the apical perspective and identifying the first suture, which serves as a dividing line. Whorls are then counted from this line, with estimates made to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nBy tracing the path of the aperture through space and time, we can chart the trajectory of the shell's growth. This path can be graphically and mathematically represented, allowing us to manipulate the parameters and modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis. By exploring the intricacies of this process, we hope to shed light on the underlying mechanisms driving the evolution of Prunum.",
            "For the past decade, Indonesia has been stuck in a rut when it comes to neonatal and infant mortality rates.  Despite being on track to meet some of the Millennium Development Goals, such as water and sanitation targets, the country's progress in child and maternal health has been woefully inadequate.  The reasons for this stagnation are complex, but they point to a need to overhaul the entire health system rather than just implementing more programs.\n\nOne glimmer of hope is that Indonesia has made some progress in getting skilled healthcare workers to more births.  Now, 72% of births take place with a skilled professional present, which sounds impressive, but it's a mixed bag.  Many of these skilled workers are traditional midwives who lack the training to handle complications during delivery, which is a leading cause of maternal deaths.  In other words, these statistics are somewhat misleading and there's still a lot of work to be done.  Furthermore, there's been a disturbing trend of fewer children under five receiving medical treatment for diarrheal illnesses.  And to make matters worse, data on postnatal care is spotty and reveals a pressing concern, with low rates across the board.\n\nThe country's cesarian-section rates are also a concern, hovering around 4%.  What's even more alarming is that this rate is significantly lower in rural areas, where it's a mere 2%.  This disparity highlights the problem of unequal access to healthcare services, with urban areas getting the lion's share of care.  The issue of access isn't just limited to geographic disparities; there's also a significant gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest households, with a whopping 27% difference.  It's clear that the poor are already at a disadvantage when it comes to accessing healthcare due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nSo, what's the next step towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators?  The question is whether Indonesia should focus on developing program-specific approaches or strengthen its overall health system without prioritizing pre- and post-pregnancy care for mothers and babies.  While programmatic approaches may seem attractive, with their clear objectives and faster results, they come with some significant drawbacks.  One major concern is that investing heavily in one area can divert resources away from other critical areas, leading to a brain drain of human resources and duplication of services.  For instance, the influx of international funding for HIV/AIDS has actually hurt the family planning sector, highlighting the need to think about the broader health system rather than just tackling individual problems in isolation.",
            "Victorian novels are infamous for their meticulous attention to period-specific detail and aristocratic settings. However, two novels that deviate from this norm are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These works seamlessly blend mystery and the bizarre, traits uncommon in the period, thereby enriching their characters and offering profound insights into their motivations and emotions. This departure from the traditional Victorian formula adds depth to the narratives, making them more relatable and engaging.\n\nAs the narrative unfolds, the lines between reality and fantasy become increasingly blurred. In Oliver Twist, for instance, the protagonist's experiences are frequently presented through dreamlike sequences, which serve as a window into his inner world. These visions reveal Oliver's inner turmoil, his emotional pain, and his growing understanding of the harsh realities surrounding him. The infamous shooting scene in chapter 28 is a prime example of this. Oliver's vivid recollection of the event is more akin to a dream than a recollection, highlighting his loss of control over the events unfolding around him. The overwhelming pain and fear he endures are a testament to the dire circumstances he faces, leaving the reader to ponder whose hands are behind his misfortune. This raises questions about Oliver's agency and whether he's capable of controlling his own fate. As his sense of defeat grows, it becomes apparent that the influence of his harsh environment, particularly the manipulative Fagin, has taken its toll, rendering him powerless to act.\n\nIn a similar vein, Wuthering Heights employs dream sequences to explore the complexities of its characters. The passage from Dickens (220) illustrates the disorienting effect of these visions, where the boundaries between reality and fantasy are constantly shifting. The protagonist's perception of time becomes distorted, with days passing in an instant, and nights dragging on interminably. This blurred sense of time serves to heighten the sense of unease and desperation, leaving the reader questioning the nature of reality and the characters' place within it.",
            "‎ It was only a couple of years ago that I found myself in a peculiar situation as an after-school tutor for elementary school students. I was tasked with helping them excel in whatever subject they struggled with, but my strengths lay in English and reading. One student in particular, a boy named Adrian, caught my attention. He was in third or fourth grade, and his reading troubles were quite puzzling. Some letters he could pronounce with ease, while others not at all - it was as if he was speaking a different language. Given his Latino background, I initially assumed he might be struggling with the language barrier, but he spoke perfect English. As I tried to assist him, it dawned on me that something was amiss. That's when his mother walked in, and I realized the truth: Adrian's problem was not with speaking English, but with understanding the English alphabet. We communicated in broken Spanish, with my own limited proficiency, but the moment of clarity hit me like a ton of bricks - the boy could read just fine, but was struggling with the fundamentals of the English language.\n\nI share this story to highlight the often-overlooked issue of the language barrier in schools, particularly in California. It serves as a reminder that the problem is not always as straightforward as we assume. Even for a child who speaks perfect English, reading can be a daunting task. It's an issue that everyone acknowledges, but the real question is: what can we do about it?\n\nAdrian's case was relatively simple to address - he needed additional tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for the many children who barely speak English, the solution is far more complex. No single approach will suffice - not dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutors, or ESL classes alone. Instead, the key lies in combining these methods to create a comprehensive solution.\n\nThe dual language system is an excellent approach not only for children whose first language is Spanish but for all students. Research has shown that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Many people fear that this approach is a waste of resources and that most students won't benefit, but this is a misconception. If implemented as the norm, rather than the exception, all students would benefit from it. So, how can we make this a reality? Do we expect every teacher to be bilingual? No, that's unrealistic and impractical. However, we can have bilingual assistants, tutors, or aides to support students and teachers alike.",
            "We're often told from a young age that there's something greater than us, something we can't fully grasp. While some of us attend Sunday school or temple, others search within themselves for answers. Many accept the faiths passed down by our parents, but some reject them entirely, believing our personal universe is all that exists. We navigate our way to self-discovery through our unique perspectives on spirituality, desperately seeking a guiding light in the darkness. \n\nMy dad and I sat on the porch, listening to the rain, as he gazed into the downpour. His thin frame and sparse hair made him seem almost fragile, and his distant stare made me feel alone. I couldn't bring myself to talk about how much I'd miss him, fearing it would make the reality even more painful for both of us. I hugged him, moved closer, and shared his silence as we watched the rain fall.\n\nMy dad passed away in December, five days after my 22nd birthday, despite the chemo and radiation treatments that prolonged his suffering. I couldn't understand the point of it all. In that dark night, I didn't pray; I'd lost faith in a God who seemed to have stopped listening a long time ago. \n\nI didn't want to witness his final moments, so I avoided it. I chose to remember my dad for the person he was, not the way he left. I knew him better than anyone, and I was certain he wouldn't have wanted me to watch him die. For three days, I curled up in my bed, waiting for the news in silence. But no one called.",
            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" is often considered a paradox, a blend of the old and the new, as Ian Watt so aptly described it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been simultaneously praised and criticized, accused of lacking depth and yet admired for its ability to evoke the 'terrible sublime' (Burke). At its inception, the \"Gothic Novel\" genre was a fusion of elements from both 'ancient' and 'modern' romances, as Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto so cleverly demonstrated. Walpole's innovative work combined outdated theatrical elements with the modern novel's emphasis on character psychology, creating a unique literary style he dubbed \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre drew heavily from medieval theatre, architecture, and traditions, often incorporating them in unexpected ways. When The Castle of Otranto was first published, the term 'gothic' was already used to describe various styles, periods, and cultures, often with negative connotations – seen as old-fashioned or unsophisticated in comparison to the modern era. The marriage of these contrasting elements is what allowed the Gothic genre to endure and remain both nostalgic and fresh to readers across time.\n\nOne of the key ideas driving the Gothic Novel is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval ideals of knighthood, as exemplified by the process of training a knight, were not only retained but also reinterpreted in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry held significant importance for Gothic writers like Walpole because it represented a timeless ideal: the brave, honorable, and competent knight. Through the use of chivalric themes and language, the 'gothic past' became an idealized and romanticized era, hinting at the future evolution of Gothic into Romanticism. This nostalgia was likely a reflection of Walpole's own experiences during a time of social and political turmoil. As he wrote The Castle of Otranto, he was immersed in the turmoil and likely felt a sense of disillusionment with the present society, perceiving it as lacking the moral values and goodness of the 'gothic era.' This sentiment is evident in characters like Frederic, who embodies the chivalric ideals: he's a prince, a figure of tragedy, and a supposed hero, all of which are conventionally chivalric images. However, Frederic's character also showcases an excessive, exaggerated version of the gallant knight, introducing the trope of excess that would become a hallmark of the Gothic genre (66).",
            "We've all seen the intricate web of the supply chain unfold before our eyes, a complex dance of goods moving from customer demand to raw materials, production, and distribution. The term \"supply chain management\" was first coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who described it as the master plan of planning, implementing, and controlling each step to deliver what customers want, exactly when they want it. At its core, supply chain management is a delicate balancing act - a symphony of processes that require precision and timing to keep the customer satisfied.\n\nThere are six key players in this grand symphony: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Skilled managers use these elements to create a harmonious flow of goods, ensuring that customers receive the best possible service. Each step in the supply chain is crucial, and one misstep can lead to chaos.\n\nProduction is the foundation upon which the entire supply chain is built. It's where the \"when, why, where, and how\" of product creation is decided. Managers must tap into the market to understand customer needs, and once they do, they can decide what products to produce, how many to produce, and where to produce them - all while keeping customer demand and satisfaction in mind. Every detail counts, from production scheduling to equipment maintenance, as even the smallest miscalculation can lead to costly delays or inefficiencies.\n\nFor instance, my own experiences working at retail giants like Wal-Mart and Target taught me the importance of having a clear, step-by-step approach to every aspect of the business. From employee uniforms to receiving shipments, having a solid plan in place helps prevent confusion and ensures a smooth operation.\n\nSupply is the second key element in the supply chain equation. It involves making strategic decisions about a company's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. This might involve deciding which divisions of production best suit which processes, or deciding to outsource work to other companies to achieve velocity - the ability to deliver high-quality products quickly and efficiently, all while keeping costs in check.",
            "The sign above Ellen Page's head reads a haunting truth: Hitler is alive in Burma. The film star stands alone on a street corner, the unsettling message scrawled on her makeshift sign in bold letters. The phrase is a powerful reminder of the struggles unfolding in Myanmar, a Southeast Asian country under the iron grip of a ruthless military junta. The regime seized power in 1962 through a coup d'état, and its authoritarian rule has been marked by brutal suppression of dissent.\n\nIn 2007, a wave of street protests shook the country, earning the name \"The Saffron Revolution\" due to the colorful robes worn by the Burmese monks who led the movement. While the initial protests were peaceful, the government's response escalated into a violent crackdown, with military forces invading and ransacking monasteries across the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned, and a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was tragically killed for simply witnessing a street protest. The official death toll was 13, but Colonel Hla Win, a former army officer, revealed a darker truth: \"Many more people have been killed in recent days than you've heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.\"\n\nThis is not a new phenomenon. Throughout history, governments have sought to maintain control over their citizens, crushing dissent and opposition with an iron fist. The early Roman emperors claimed divine right to rule, while Japanese emperors were believed to be gods, sent to guide their people to prosperity. Even our modern-day leaders have been known to engage in questionable practices, such as President George W. Bush's secret conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of a fringe group with a questionable agenda.\n\nWe see echoes of these tactics in infamous events like the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, where Chinese students and intellectuals were brutally suppressed, with estimated death tolls ranging from 200 to 3,000. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups and the government systematically killed thousands of Tutsis and moderates, is another stark example. And of course, there's the infamous \"Third Reich,\" where Hitler's regime perpetrated one of the most heinous crimes against humanity, targeting Jews and other minority groups.",
            "Duke Ellington’s enduring impact on jazz can be attributed in large part to his remarkable longevity and corresponding ability to shape his orchestra over time. Although his piano presence is subtle in many of the selected compositions, as a composer Ellington excelled at crafting intricate pieces that showcased the unique talents of each band member. He carefully constructed the framework for soloists to improvise within, while also writing tightly orchestrated passages that highlighted the distinctive styles of individual musicians. This approach allowed him to emphasize the overall tone of the orchestra, creating cohesive and original sounds for each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound and how they blended together in the ensemble enabled him to write some of the most groundbreaking and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\n\nA notable example of Ellington’s innovative approach is Creole Love Call, which showcases his use of voice as a jazz instrument throughout his career. This 12-bar blues piece, featuring six choruses, demonstrates Ellington’s ability to complement the styles of his soloists. The song begins with a smooth, melodic voice, gradually transitioning to a rougher sound towards the end. The following choruses feature a muted trumpet solo, a sweeping clarinet solo, and a full-band echo of the first chorus, each emphasizing different elements of the melody. The climactic final chorus features the reeds taking the lead, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections. The return to the first chorus structure in the final section sees the voice adopting the \"growl\" technique, soloing as an instrument. This innovative use of voice as a tone color adds a rich dimension to the piece.\n\nEllington’s use of voice in Creole Love Call is emblematic of a recurring stylistic trait throughout his work. In Hot and Bothered, he combines his skill in tight orchestration with his ear for tone color, achieving a rich and complementary sound through a call and response phrase between Bubber Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing. This approach is further explored in It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing), where Ellington utilizes Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "I'd been plagued by a nagging feeling for as long as I could remember - this maddening need for something that always seemed to elude me. It began when I was 14, at the height of my teenage angst. Three years later, at 17, the yearning was still there, only now it had evolved into a desire for connection, for someone to share my life with. Yet, despite the attention from various suitors, none of them had ever really captured my interest. I spent countless hours grappling with this enigma, trying to pinpoint the source of my unique affliction. Theories abounded, but nothing ever seemed quite right. So I continued to navigate life, forever questioning my desires.\n\nMy days at home were usually a tranquil oasis, a refuge from the world outside. My parents were a picture of serenity, rarely arguing with each other, and even less so with me. They did, however, occasionally clash with my independent streak, which they saw as a desirable but occasionally troublesome trait. I suppose it's no surprise, given their calm nature, that I, on the other hand, was a whirlwind of energy and curiosity, a combination that made me likable and endearing to those around me.\n\nBut today was different. As I wandered from room to room, searching for inspiration, I was jolted by the sound of my mother's anguished cry from the kitchen. I rushed in, panic rising as I asked, \"Mom?! What's wrong?!\" I saw her lying on the floor, writhing in pain, her voice strained as she gasped, \"Ow...sweetie, I...need you to take me to the hospital.\" I rushed to her side, putting a reassuring hand on her shoulder. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to pick you up.\" My mother directed me, her words clipped and urgent, and I could sense the severity of her pain. With my training in self-defense, I scooped her up, placing her gently in the backseat, and drove her to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital's antiseptic smell and air of concern were a far cry from the peaceful atmosphere I was used to, but I was too preoccupied with my mother's well-being to notice. I helped her onto the examination table, called out for the doctors, and watched anxiously as a team of professionals swarmed around us. My mother had taken a tumble off a step stool while reaching for a vase in the high cabinet.",
            "This study aimed to explore the relationship between adherence to the \"Mediterranean Diet\" - specifically the \"alternate Mediterranean diet score\" - and the risk of chronic heart disease and stroke.  The alternate Mediterranean diet is an offshoot of the Mediterranean diet, characterized by higher intake of plant-based foods, monounsaturated fats, and fish, along with lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate amounts of alcohol are also permitted.\n\nPast studies have shown that sticking to the Mediterranean diet reduces overall and cardiovascular mortality risk, and an intervention trial demonstrated that it's more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering bad cholesterol levels in obese individuals. However, these studies focused on mortality and weight loss, not specifically on stroke risk.\n\nThis epidemiological study tracked 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, who were part of the Nurses' Health Study - a long-term study of over 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. The researchers computed an alternate Mediterranean diet score six times between 1984 and 2004, using self-reported food frequency questionnaires that assessed participants' nutrient intake over the past year. An impressive 95% of the nurses remained in the study for the full 20 years. The diet scores were validated through various studies and verified against medical records, hospital reports, and death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, cases were considered \"probable\" and included - about 17% of all strokes and 24% of non-fatal heart attacks were classified this way.\n\nOther factors, such as body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use, were also calculated for each food frequency questionnaire. Starting in 1986, participants' leisure-time physical activity was also assessed.\n\nTo minimize random variation and better reflect long-term dietary habits, the researchers averaged the alternate Mediterranean diet scores over two prior years. Adjustments were made for potential confounders like age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing Cox proportional-hazard modeling, the researchers examined the link between the alternate Mediterranean diet score and the risk of heart disease and stroke, with separate models for fatal and non-fatal cases. The results showed that higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher alternate Mediterranean diet score, was associated with a lower risk of heart disease and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, there were 2391 cases of heart disease, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular deaths (fatal heart disease and strokes combined). Women in the top alternate Mediterranean diet quintile had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "The year 2007 marked the beginning of a severe economic downturn in the United States, with unemployment on the rise, the housing market in shambles, and several of America's largest corporations left reeling. The aftermath of this crisis still lingers, prompting a pressing question: what led to this calamity and how can we prevent it from happening again?  At its core, the financial disaster was born from a catastrophic mix of shortsighted and naive policy decisions that coerced banks and financial institutions into dooming themselves with reckless sub-prime lending. This reckless lending was fueled by a woefully underdeveloped financial infrastructure, which was further exacerbated by the government's pressure on Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) to take on these flawed mortgages and repackage them into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the destructive cycle began, with banks and financial institutions transferring the chaos onto the very mortgages they had sold, and ultimately, onto the entire economy.\n\nLooking back to the Clinton era of 1999, the roots of this crisis began to take shape. President Clinton sought to bolster his popularity ahead of his re-election by easing lending restrictions, thereby setting the stage for the sub-prime crisis that would unfold seven years later. In a 1999 New York Times article, Steven Holmes astutely noted, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, was under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand its mortgage lending to low- and moderate-income individuals, while also pushing to maintain its impressive growth in profits.\" Holmes's warning was eerily prescient: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may struggle in times of economic downturn, necessitating a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As we now know, this ill-conceived lending strategy would ultimately lead to the economic meltdown.\n\nSeveral factors converged to send the economy into a tailspin, including the proliferation of complex mortgage structures such as adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These innovations served to further entangle various sectors of the economy with the housing market, leaving U.S. households and financial markets precariously exposed to even minor fluctuations in housing prices. The housing bubble inevitably burst, leaving financial institutions that had invested in mortgage-backed securities reeling. By 2007, the top five U.S. investment banks collectively held an astonishing $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, accounting for approximately 30% of the country's GDP. The aftermath was brutal: Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at fire-sale prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to adapt to a life of intense regulation.

            "Ah, the infamous exposition - that pesky chapter in your story where you take a deep breath, stretch your writing wings, and either dazzle or bore your readers to tears.  Dr. Merlin has been known to let out a frustrated groan at her computer screen when she finds herself lost in a sea of unnecessary details, and not the exciting kind either.\n\nExposition isn't exactly your best friend.\n\nYou've likely heard the age-old writing tip: \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still falls into the trap of lengthy passages that leave the reader wondering when the actual story will start.  Exposition is that nagging voice in your ear, urging you to get the backstory out of the way so you can move on to the juicy parts (not to be confused with the other voice whispering in your ear to share every single detail about each character's childhood).\n\nIn its simplest form, exposition is when you spell out the details of what happened, often in a straightforward style.  In film, it's the scene where one character spews out a bunch of information to another, à la \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, it's often the author doing the telling.\n\nLet's examine an example.  Imagine you're reading a story where you're told that the heroine met her beloved at a certain time and place, they had a lavish wedding, and her husband was tragically murdered before her eyes.  You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to take up two pages, with only a couple of lines of dialogue from each of them.  You'd expect the author to delve deeper into the husband's character, showcasing his devotion through his words and actions, and you'd also expect to see the heroine's transformation through small, telling moments that reveal how much his presence enriched her life.  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally invested in his fate and gain insight into the heroine's character: what drew her to him, the depth of their connection, and clues about her thoughts, values, and dreams as reflected through his eyes.  You'd mourn his loss alongside her, deepening your connection to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you'd want more substance behind the bare bones of the plot: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, it's your job to provide that depth.  Sometimes, it's tempting to rush past certain things.  You might introduce a new character, mentioning that he used to be in the Air Force, works as the night manager of a gas station, has been married twice, has no kids, enjoys fishing on weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I tuned into the local news from Columbus, Ohio, watching the NBC 4 broadcast on August 13, 2011. The morning's lead story was a live report about a disturbing incident in Ashley, Ohio, where a man named Shad Hostettler had allegedly stabbed his wife. Although her name wasn't mentioned, I was shocked by his mug shot, which seemed to convey an aura of malevolence. The news team devoted a relatively brief two minutes to this developing story, providing only the bare essentials – multiple stab wounds and an arrest. I think they struck the right balance.\n\nThe next story covered an early morning shooting in the Sharon Woods area, which had left 18-year-old Travis Buyers critically injured. The SWAT Team was investigating, but no arrests had been made, and no suspects were identified. This report felt truncated, and I couldn't help but speculate that the reason might have been the victim's racial background. I've noticed this phenomenon before – that the media often glosses over crimes committed against minorities. In contrast, when a white child or adult is a victim, the news coverage is inevitably more extensive. \n\nThe news then shifted to the discovery of a gunshot hole in a Med-Flight helicopter. Details were provided about the estimated location of the incident, and it was determined that a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle was responsible. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for any information leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nI was also treated to a brief weather forecast, which warned of rain and thunderstorms on Saturday afternoon. Although the temperatures were expected to remain in the mid-to-low eighties for the weekend, the report felt rushed, almost like a teaser to keep viewers engaged.\n\nThe news also covered a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The perpetrator was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt, standing at around six feet tall and weighing approximately 150 pounds. I found it striking that the news team spent an unusual amount of time emphasizing his racial characteristics and skin tone.\n\nFinally, I came across a story about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin who had been found guilty of conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. What caught my attention was the unusual way the news team presented his sentence – 300 months rather than 25 years. I'm not sure if they thought this sounded more severe or if it was just a stylistic choice. They also highlighted Rodriguez's Hispanic heritage, which seemed inconsequential to the story itself.",
            "There's an unshakeable connection between brothers – a bond that's both beautiful and brutal, full of contradictions. This complicated link is woven with threads of love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. Brothers have a unique understanding of one another, a sense of kinship that surpasses all other relationships. When they gaze at each other, they catch glimpses of themselves, unfiltered and raw. It's during life's darkest moments that the true nature of this bond is laid bare, revealing both its beauty and ugliness. The consequences of this complex web of emotions can be overwhelming, but they're an essential part of the fraternal experience. When you lock eyes with a brother and see your own reflection staring back, you're confronted with the truth – not the way others see you, but the truth of who you are. It's in the actions you take and the repercussions that follow that your character is truly revealed.\n\nIn James Hurst's poignant short story, \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" we're given a glimpse into this intricate bond between two brothers. Set against the vibrant backdrop of a lush landscape, their doomed journey unfolds, marked by the clash of bitter disappointment and intense pride in a pivotal moment. Only one brother emerges alive, leaving behind a trail of questions and reflections. Through the protagonist's characterization and his interactions with his brother, Doodle, as well as the narrator's insightful perspective, we're shown the depth of their emotions and the world around them. These factors heavily influence the protagonist's actions, driving him towards a tragic fate.\n\nAt the heart of the story lies the protagonist's all-consuming pride. From the moment he begins to take his little brother on adventures to their fateful, final excursion, he's harbored a deep-seated resentment towards Doodle. He'd envisioned a brother who could keep up with him, sharing in the joys of physical activities like holding his breath, running, and climbing vines in the swamp. He wanted a partner to explore the world with, someone to share in the excitement of racing to the landing and perching in the top of the pine tree. But Doodle's fragile heart made these dreams impossible, leaving the protagonist with a crushing sense of disappointment. He even entertains the thought of suffocating his brother, a revelation that speaks to the complexities of his own psyche. Yet, his resolve crumbles when Doodle smiles at him, revealing a glimmer of love that's been lurking beneath the surface all along. This tender moment humanizes the protagonist, showing that his conviction wasn't as strong as he thought.",
            "Our minds are incredibly complex, information-processing machines. Over time, our understanding of the brain has evolved, and so have the metaphors used to describe it. We used to compare it to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, a book, and most recently, a computer. But as we delve deeper, we realize that these comparisons have limitations, and could lead us down a path of misconceptions.\n\nInformation trickles into our brains through our senses, transformed from physical stimuli like touch, heat, light, and sound into electrical signals. As this information bounces around in our brains, it's processed in two distinct ways: bottom-up and top-down. When I look at a picture of a black box on a white background, my brain starts by identifying the simple details, like color and orientation, and builds from there to conclude I'm looking at a box. But then, my brain uses its prior knowledge to speed up the process, identifying it as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole.\n\nOnce our brains have processed information to some extent, we have to decide what's important and what can be ignored. An attention filter kicks in, prioritizing signals and deciding which cognitive processes get access to the information. For instance, I can process every blade of grass when I'm looking down, but a healthy attention filter keeps me from noticing them individually. On the other hand, I can pick out my own name in a noisy room, even if it's not the loudest sound.\n\nThere are multiple stages to information processing, and our brains modulate the results at each stage, using attention to refine and prioritize. Before our brains can process information, it first needs to be stored. There are three main types of memory: sensory, working, and long-term. When information enters our brains, it's encoded, a process that varies depending on the type of sensory input. For written words, this might involve analyzing their structure, sound, or meaning.\n\nOnce information is stored, it needs to be maintained. Research on animals suggests that working memory, which stores information for about 20 seconds, relies on an electrical signal looping through specific neurons for a short period. Long-term memory, on the other hand, is thought to be stored in the structure of proteins.\n\nDifferent theories exist about how our brains organize knowledge, each drawing from psychology, computer science, and neurophysiology. One such model, the semantic network, proposes that concepts are represented by nodes, linked together based on their relatedness. For example, if I think of a chair, it might be connected to the concept of a table, which could be linked to wood, and so forth.",
            "Aldous Huxley's dystopian novel Brave New World paints a stark picture of a world where technology and a capitalistic system have created a society where individuality is suffocated and people are conditioned to prioritize immediate gratification above all else. The community takes precedence over the individual, with citizens molded from birth to crave instant happiness and obedience. But scratch beneath the surface, and you'll find that these people are mere pawns in a larger game, their lives dictated by the World Controller's iron-fisted ideology. A Marxist lens reveals Huxley's deep-seated suspicions about the impending dangers of these systems, with terms like homogeny and reification echoing through his narrative like a warning bell.\n\nThrough the lens of Marxist theory, particularly the concept of false consciousness, Huxley skewers capitalism's manipulation of the common folk. People are kept in the dark about their true place in the economic hierarchy, too busy chasing their own self-interest to notice the strings being pulled from above. The lower classes, Delta, Gamma, and so on, are conditioned to crave, consume, and indulge, their willpower subverted by the hypnotic power of hypnopædia. The World Controller pulls the strings, orchestrating this spectacle of consumerism with an iron fist. Hegemony, the notion that certain groups dominate others, is writ large in this dystopian world, where the lower classes are oblivious to their exploitation, buying into an ideology that reinforces their oppression. The upper classes, meanwhile, are either born with the knowledge or acquire it early on, but they do little to challenge the status quo, content to occupy their place in the hierarchy.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships between individuals are shallow and superficial. Characters lack depth, and even among the main characters, their interactions are one-dimensional. Huxley may be suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism has drained humanity of its free will and emotional expression. Love, passion, and genuine human connection are absent, replaced by surface-level interactions that reduce people to mere objects of desire. The societal classes' complacency with their roles in the hierarchy is a testament to the effects of capitalism, where people are told they're superior as long as they consume, obey, and conform to the norms of their peers.",
            "It's been nearly three years since I enrolled at University Park, and I've found that navigating the campus has become a major challenge. For many of us, including myself, getting from one place to another can be a real headache. My freshman year, I was stuck in an East Halls dorm room - the farthest outpost on campus, with the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center being the only structures beyond it. With classes scattered throughout the campus, including far-flung spots like the Willard building near the center, traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to those destinations could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially when the weather turned nasty. I recently spoke to a fellow alum who's not much older than me, and they shared that not too long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the university by vast tracts of undeveloped land. That vacant space has since been transformed into sports fields, sleek new buildings like the Creamery and health services building, and apartment complexes. As the campus continues to expand, it's getting increasingly difficult to get from one place to another.\n\nI had a conversation with a friend who'd recently dusted off their bike after a several-year hiatus, and they expressed their surprise at how much they'd missed it. \"Bikes are the way to go,\" they said. \"For a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Not only is bicycling great exercise, but it's also the most efficient way to travel. You can cover 30 miles or more with just a bowl of oatmeal and some physical exertion. I've since moved off campus, just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I made this year was buying a bike. With classes in Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from my home, bike-riding has shaved off 20 minutes from my daily commute. However, Pollock Road is the most direct route to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always the easiest road to navigate, bike or not. There are some advantages to walking, but personally, I'm too busy to walk every day. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option, and it would take about 30-40 minutes to get to Thomas building. That's over two and a half hours a week - a significant chunk of time I just can't afford to waste."
