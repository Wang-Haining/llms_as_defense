            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the course of my academic journey, I've come to realize that a career in social work is where my passions and values align. I'm drawn to the Division of Family and Children Services, where I can make a meaningful difference in the lives of kids who've been mistreated or neglected, and support families in turmoil. My personal values – service, respect, integrity, and a commitment to self-improvement – aren't just ideals for social workers; they're fundamental principles that guide me every day. For instance, I believe in serving others without expectation of reward, respecting the dignity of every individual, and upholding the highest standards of ethics. I'm also committed to helping people build stronger relationships and continually honing my skills to stay adaptable and effective in my role.\n\nWhile I've always wanted to make a positive impact, I wasn't sure how to channel my energy. Throughout high school and college, I watched as people around me struggled to cope with challenges in unhealthy ways. That's why I pursued a degree in Psychology, hoping to understand the complexities of human behavior. Although I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009, I still felt uncertain about my career path. Everything changed when I visited a friend who was hosting a vulnerable teenager seeking refuge from an abusive home life. The following day, I learned he'd called the authorities to intervene. To see if I could help, I went to his parents' house, where I discreetly shared my concerns with the police and mentioned my recent Psychology degree. They asked me to speak with the parents, as there wasn't much they could do. When I confronted them about their behavior, they seemed evasive and made excuses for their son's actions. That experience made me realize the need for social workers who can help families navigate conflicts and provide support.\n\nAnother essential aspect of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim to value individuality, but our actions often suggest otherwise. We idealize conformity and criticize those who break the mold. I've never been one to shy away from challenging these norms. Throughout my time in high school and college, I expressed my individuality through my appearance, hobbies, and activism. I've worn my hair in bold colors, pierced my ears in unconventional ways, and spoken out against racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it. I believe in fighting for social justice and will continue to do so in my career as a social worker.",
            "Sleepless nights can be a real puzzle, and the age-old question of why we can't seem to catch a wink has been a topic of interest for years. This paper dives into the two primary models that attempt to explain insomnia: the biological and sociocultural models. The biological model zeroes in on the genetic information we inherit, as well as the medical aspects of our overall health. On the other hand, the sociocultural model explores how environmental factors, like our cultural background, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status, contribute to our sleep patterns. By examining various studies related to these models, we aim to gain a better understanding of the intricate relationships between genetics, environment, and sleep.\n\nInsomnia can manifest in different ways - as a standalone disorder, linked to another mental health condition, or caused by external factors like medical complications or substance intake. The primary sleep disorders fall under two categories: Dyssonias and Parasomnias. Dyssonias, which include Primary Insomnia and Narcolepsy, primarily affect the ability to fall asleep or stay asleep. Parasomnias, such as Nightmare Disorder and Sleep Terror Disorder, are characterized by abnormal behaviors and physiological occurrences during sleep. Our focus lies in understanding the biological and sociocultural factors that contribute to insomnia, a sleep disorder that can significantly impact daily life.\n\nFrom a biological perspective, research suggests that our genes play a significant role in regulating our sleep-wake cycles. A study on mice discovered that neurons in the hypothalamus, containing orexin, are responsible for controlling our sleep patterns. The activation of the GABAB receptor, found on these neurons, promotes sleep, while its inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and improved sleep quality. A study using the GABAB agonist (baclofen) showed an increase in sleep time in mice, indicating a potential genetic basis for sleep regulation in humans. This finding implies that an alteration in the GABAB receptor could lead to sleep disturbances, negatively impacting daily life and tasks that require focus and attention.\n\nThe sociocultural implications of this study are profound. If the GABAB receptor is inherited, it could regulate sleep patterns, and any alteration to this receptor could naturally disrupt sleep, affecting various aspects of life. This highlights the complex interplay between genetics, environment, and sleep, suggesting that a deeper understanding of these factors is crucial in addressing insomnia.",
            "I still recall the first time I delved into the complex world of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD). It's a disorder where the central nervous system, the brain, has trouble processing auditory information, leaving individuals with normal hearing unable to properly decipher sounds, differentiate conversations from background noise, or separate words. The disorder's history dates back to the 1950s when researchers began identifying it as \"auditory imperception\" while studying children with communicative disorders.\n\nAs I continued to learn about CAPD, I discovered that it's a multifaceted condition, manifesting in various ways. Some individuals may struggle to localize sounds, differentiate between multiple acoustic events, or recognize sound patterns. Others may have difficulty detecting changes in speech, such as sarcasm, or interpreting sound clues. The disorder can also make it challenging for individuals to determine the sequence of auditory information presented to them.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD requires a systematic evaluation of listening behavior and performance on tests of auditory function. This may involve various professionals, including audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists, using a range of measures to assess auditory-related skills. No single tool or test has been proven to be consistently effective in diagnosing CAPD, and the underlying cause remains unknown. Tests may present individuals with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and ask them to differentiate certain items, such as words or numbers. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring responses to these signals.\n\nAs a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom, helping a student with CAPD requires a thoughtful and supportive approach. By understanding the disorder and its effects, educators can create a more inclusive and supportive environment for students with CAPD. This includes adapting teaching methods, providing additional support, and being patient with students who may struggle to process auditory information.",
            "We see in Twelfth Night that a disguise, though useful for pulling off an elaborate deception, ultimately forces the wearer to confront the consequences of their actions. Rejection of the disguise is inevitable, but this can lead to feelings of isolation, as one risks losing touch with their true self in the process. The trouble lies in deciding between preserving one's own identity and maintaining relationships with those around them. While some may take a deception lightly, others may be deeply offended by it, highlighting a delicate balance between self-preservation and connection with others.\n\nThe topic of deception in Twelfth Night, specifically through the lens of gender role reversal, raises more questions than answers. Why do characters like Viola feel the need to adopt a disguise, and what lies beneath this desire? For Viola, disguising herself as a man is a means of self-protection, as evidenced by her lines \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count.\" (5.1.247-249) Her plan succeeds, but it also cuts her off from the support of other women, leaving her isolated and struggling to navigate her suppressed emotions.\n\nAs a foreigner in a new land, Viola's disguise makes her so convincing that Olivia falls in love with her, mistaking her for her twin brother Sebastian. Meanwhile, Viola must also contend with her own unrequited love for Orsino, who seems to hold a deep affection for her as Cesario. This may seem progressive to modern readers, but Twelfth Night can also be seen as a exploration of how deception can reveal hidden desires, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages suggest that their attraction to Cesario may be a manifestation of unexpressed emotions, but it's also possible that Olivia's affection is a satirical commentary on the superficiality of her time, as she quickly switches her affections to Sebastian and regards Cesario/Viola as a sister rather than a love interest, as seen in her line \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315)",
            "The brutal nature of German colonial rule has been well-documented, with numerous observers highlighting the devastating impact on the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, the German colonial empire was a complex entity, with a diverse array of policies, styles, and geographies. Educational provision across its territories was similarly varied. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a surprisingly well-educated and literate African population. German efforts in Kamerun and other colonies had also been praised by contemporary authors, who acknowledged their successes in promoting education.\n\nBut South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast. Unlike East Africa, where the government invested heavily in state schools and education for locals, in South West Africa, the task of educating the native population fell largely to underfunded missionary societies. The government did, however, devote significant resources to educating Europeans, establishing state schools and closely regulating missionary institutions. This educational divide had long-lasting effects on South West Africa, even after German rule had ended. Other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, whereas in South West Africa, the vast majority of the population remained uneducated and illiterate.\n\nA multitude of social, political, and economic factors contributed to the divergent experience of South West Africa. To shed more light on this phenomenon, this paper aims to delve deeper into the underlying causes and scrutinize new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThe scholarly literature on German colonial education is vast, with many sources written in German during the early twentieth century. These early works focused on describing the features of educational systems in the colonies. Later studies, written in English, broadened the discussion by comparing education in different German colonies and providing in-depth analyses of specific aspects of education. Notably, Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa stands out for its comprehensive comparison of the two colonies and its identification of the key factors that drove their educational differences. According to Cohen, the presence of a large settler population in South West Africa was a major contributor to the colony's unique educational system.\n\nCompared to other German colonies, South West Africa had a relatively temperate climate, with arid desert regions making up a significant portion of the territory. This relatively hospitable environment drew a substantial European population to the area, with nearly 15,000 whites living in South West Africa by 1913. In contrast, East Africa, with its smaller settler population, had fewer than 5,400 European residents at the same time.",
            "The class of Popular Music has ballooned over the past 100 years, now boasting an impossibly long list of genres that seems impossible to catalogue. And if that weren't enough, many of these genres - rock, country, jazz, folk, and more - have spawned a dizzying array of sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, each branching off from the last. One genre that has arguably become the most adventurous and expressive of all is Heavy Metal, which has been expressing a wide range of emotions over the past 40 years, albeit with a clear lean towards the darker side of the emotional spectrum.\n\nHeavy Metal's flexibility has allowed it to incorporate diverse styles and themes from other genres, and people have jumped at the chance to create their own sub-genres, which in turn gave birth to even more sub-sub-genres. Fast-forward to today, and the Heavy Metal movement is so fragmented that it's hard to pin down exactly what Heavy Metal even is. To truly understand the dizzying array of metal music out there, you need to grasp what the metal movement is all about, and why it's so much more than just a genre.\n\nAt its core, Metal is a movement defined by its darkness, a music of excess - more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatrics. And yet, it's also a movement where musicians are all about showcasing their chops, pushing the limits of what's possible on their instruments. Metal's also inextricably linked to the world of psychedelics, with the mid-70s counterculture inspiring musicians to create music that was truly otherworldly. The result was a sound that was both visceral and deeply unsettling, a departure from the more upbeat, feel-good music that dominated the airwaves. Later generations of metal musicians drew inspiration from this darker, more primal energy, infusing it with the Gothic Romanticism of the era.\n\nLyrics like those found in Helter Skelter, a song often cited as one of the first Heavy Metal tracks, showcase the movement's penchant for the dark and the visceral. Written by the Beatles in response to the Rolling Stones' own darker offerings, Helter Skelter is a testament to the pioneering spirit of Heavy Metal, a genre that continues to evolve and branch out in all directions.",
            "It's only fitting that Henri Rousseau, the pioneering Post-Impressionist artist, should have been crafting his own dreamlike works years before the Surrealist movement even took off. His captivating 1910 painting, The Dream, not only depicts a woman marveling at the wonders of a fantastical land, but it's also a deeply personal reflection of Rousseau's own aspirations as an artist. Since embarking on his artistic journey, Rousseau had been driven by a burning desire for recognition, acceptance, and praise from his peers – a goal that ultimately led him to confront a daunting internal struggle. As he navigated his career, he found himself torn between conforming to established styles to gain acceptance from the art world he idolized, or forging his own path and embracing his unique voice.\n\nTo truly appreciate The Dream in this context, it's essential to delve into Rousseau's remarkable backstory. Born on May 21, 1844, in the charming town of Laval, northwest France, Henri Rousseau came from a relatively comfortable middle-class family, with his father working as a tinsmith and hardware dealer. Despite his comfortable upbringing, Rousseau never received formal art training, instead choosing to pursue a career in the municipal toll service, where he worked as a gabelou until the age of forty. The sobriquet 'douanier' – customs inspector – only added to his humble beginnings. The loss of his first wife, Clémence, and eight infant children left Rousseau heartbroken, and it was during this tumultuous time that he turned to painting as a source of comfort and rebirth. Unlike his contemporaries, who often romanticized the peasant class, Rousseau's folk art reflected the hopes and dreams of the common man.\n\nGiven his circumstances, Rousseau's quest for acceptance from the art world is more than understandable. As an uneducated artist who began his career at an older age, he was competing with some of the most talented and renowned modern artists of his time. It wasn't until around the same period that Matisse was establishing himself as an artist that Rousseau finally gained recognition. In her book Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon astutely observes that while both artists vied for recognition in the art world, their motivations and styles were vastly different: \"Matisse was driven by a fear of painting blandly, while Rousseau yearned to create something so conventional that he'd be welcomed into the Artiste Français.\"",
            "For centuries, philosophers have pondered an intriguing connection between ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. I firmly believe that at a fundamental level, there's a profound reason for this connection. As John Keats so eloquently puts it in his poem \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Our understanding of the world is largely shaped by education and experience, yet our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics seems to transcend these conventional paths of learning. Both ethics and aesthetics are more about describing the essence of something, rather than providing a set of strict guidelines.\n\nIn essence, our studies of morality and beauty are attempts to unpack why a piece of art or literature resonates with us, rather than a set of rigid rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior. Criticism of art or morals can never fully capture the essence of what makes something beautiful or right. Think of the countless debates about the Mona Lisa – they might revolve around concepts like composition, context, or cultural significance, but ultimately, these explanations fall short of describing why it's a masterpiece. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, we often hear a phrase like \"There's just something about it\" preceding a more in-depth analysis. I believe that both art and morals can never be reduced to a mere description of their qualities. As the brilliant Flannery O'Connor so astutely put it, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Similarly, ethics has this same elusive quality, as Ludwig Wittgenstein so eloquently stated, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\"\n\nI propose that it's this \"something\" – this je ne sais quoi – that is the most powerful attribute of both art and morality. This transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a common ground between them. I believe that morality and art are closely related because we experience both of them most profoundly at a level that can be felt, but not fully explained. This connection is especially strong when it comes to literature, as McKean so aptly observed, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany is a force to be reckoned with today - a unified country with a rich cultural tapestry woven from the threads of its alpine roots in München to the Baltic coast in Kiel.  This distinct cultural identity can be felt from the Rhine river town of Köln all the way to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. Given its unique cultural heritage, it's hardly surprising that modern Germany has its roots in the confluence of various tribes and influences. \n\nGermania, the ancestral homeland of the Germans, has a name shrouded in mystery. Scholars and historians are still debating its origins, with some pointing to a Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, whom Tacitus believed were previously known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and clashed with the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98). Others argue that Julius Caesar first coined the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, distinguishing between the Gauls he had conquered and the Germanic tribes he had yet to defeat. According to Caesar, the Gauls themselves used the term to refer to their neighbors, which he later adopted to describe the warring tribes beyond the Rhine (Caesar, 50-40 BC). Whether the term originated from the Gaulish language or derived from the spear used in warfare, known as a ger, or even the Old Irish word garim meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans were a vocal people, remains unclear. \n\nTacitus, an early Roman historian, penned his thoughts on the origins of the Germans in his 98 AD writing \"De Origine et situ Germanorum.\" In it, he described the Germans as an indigenous people, untouched by outside influences through immigration or trade. He quipped that who would choose to leave the warmth of Italy for the harsh climate and rugged landscape of Germany, unless it was their homeland? (Tacitus, 98) It's little wonder that the Romans, though they did launch conquests into Germania, rarely settled there, preferring to return to their sprawling empire. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the 1st century, they resided on the fringes of the Roman Empire, trading goods and skills acquired from their homeland for Roman patronage and military service (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).",
            "As I stood there, my mind was a blank slate, taking in the scene in front of me without any emotional response. It was as if I'd been trained to observe, but my brain refused to connect the dots, keeping my thoughts separate from any deeper understanding. My consciousness was in a state of pure observation, like a camera capturing the moment without interpretation. Thoughts flashed in and out of my mind, too fast to grasp, leaving my mental state eerily clear and uncluttered.\n\nI'd picked up 'The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain' on the advice of an artist I'd worked with, hoping to finally learn how to draw. That book explained the basics of art and how the brain processes lines, from understanding the tool to interpreting vision. One technique it taught was to surround a picture with a square frame, simplifying a complex scene into a manageable composition. At that moment, I stared at the unremarkable bowl of fruit in front of me, but my mind was too overwhelmed to apply that technique. I was frozen, mesmerized by the intricate details of the scene, unable to mentally impose the artist's frame.\n\nAs an aspiring artist, I felt like I was on the cusp of creating something special, like the start of my masterpiece, 'Work in Brown.' My hand instinctively reached for my drawing tool, my muscles tensing and relaxing as I prepared to bring my vision to life. But instead, my fingers landed on the toilet handle, and I was faced with an unwelcome reality. A stubborn brown package clung to the bottom of the toilet, defying my efforts to move it.\n\nHolding the mop loosely, I stood there, my green tie knotted uncomfortably around my neck, staring at the unpleasant surprise left for the janitorial staff at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more moments of introspection, and my hand moved towards the wall, gripped the toilet paper roll, and began wrapping itself in a makeshift mitten. I straightened up, bent down, and slowly inserted my hand into the bowl, like a parent checking the Thanksgiving turkey in the oven.",
            "Behind the wheel, a ticking time bomb. The alarming statistics of teenager fatalities have raised red flags, and it's not hard to see why. The National Institutes of Health shed light on a crucial aspect of the problem: the teen brain is still developing, making it ill-equipped to handle the risks of driving. Add to this inexperience, and you've got a deadly combination. The simple fact is, inexperienced teens are not only more likely to be involved in fatal accidents but also to be involved in rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road.\n\nAnd let's not forget the company they keep: teens are far more likely to be involved in accidents when they're driving with their friends. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that revealed a sobering correlation between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents. California and other states have introduced provisional licenses to limit the hours teens can drive and restrict passengers under a certain age, but I'm not convinced these measures go far enough.\n\nIn my opinion, the real issue lies in the fact that, as a group, the youngest drivers are statistically unable to handle the risks and responsibilities of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman's research suggests that even 18-year-olds are too young to handle the wheel, citing a common desire among young people to take risks for the thrill of it. It makes sense to delay driving until this tendency to thrill-seek has subsided. If we continue to issue licenses to young teens, we can expect the death toll to skyrocket – and by 2010, the Baby Boomers' offspring will be hitting the roads in droves, further exacerbating the problem.\n\nLegislation to address this issue wouldn't be complicated. Schools could continue to provide driver's education classes, but no one under 18 should be allowed to get behind the wheel. Provisional permits could still be issued, but only after a certain number of hours of practical training – say, the 6 hours and 50 hours of practice with an adult that California currently requires. Uniform national legislation would be a reasonable and effective way to protect teens across the country. And let's be clear: this idea is not new – it's a common-sense approach to a very real problem.",
            "Diving into the Library of Congress's vast collection of early Edison films, I decided to immerse myself in the realm of trick films, a total of fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These early masterpieces rely on creative editing to create illusions, and my film analysis focused on unraveling the poetic underpinnings of the majority of trick films and identifying the evolutionary outliers present in a few of the later ones. The trick films from this era generally adhere to a set of conventions: they're often set-bound, confined within a frontal proscenium, feature static camera angles, and stick to the one shot per film rule. However, a few daring early 20th-century films boldly break free from these rules, introducing innovative techniques like multiple shots.\n\nOne of the most striking features shared by these trick films is their rigid adherence to the frontal proscenium composition. The camera remains stationary, never deviating from its fixed position to follow characters or objects within the frame. This composition is a nod to the theatre and vaudeville traditions, which trick films drew inspiration from, particularly magic acts. The use of a stage as a setting inevitably restricts character movement to side-to-side, rather than forward or backward, as seen in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right and move along the horizontal axis, with the camera remaining steadfast, even as they exit the frame.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style also dictates that shots tend to be long and, occasionally, medium shots. Close-ups are a rarity in these early trick films, as they borrowed from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would witness the entire performance, framed by the borders of the stage. The actors generally remain grounded, never venturing towards the camera, thus rendering close-ups impossible.\n\nMost trick films adhere to the principle that one conceptual shot equals a film, limiting their length to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. This constraint restricts the narrative or dramatic scope of the trick films, which often focus on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearance, and switching acts, with minimal storytelling. However, as revealed in a closer examination of The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a single conceptual shot can be composed of multiple physical shots, expertly joined to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance.",
            "I've always been intrigued by John Taylor of Caroline, a true champion of Republicanism in the early days. As an agriculturalist and politician, he was known for his unwavering dedication to the cause of personal freedom and limited government. His passion for the agrarian way of life was at the heart of his views on governance, shaping his opinions on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the judicial system.\n\nTaylor believed that the United States had a unique opportunity to create a utopian system of government, untainted by traditional influences. This allowed him to envision a self-governing society where the natural rights of individuals were protected and respected. He firmly believed that these rights were interconnected and that denying one would undermine the value of all. These rights should, in his opinion, be beyond the reach of the government.\n\nTaylor argued that the concept of the \"state of nature\" suggested that those with physical strength and malicious intentions were often the ones who profited, but he believed this shouldn't be the case in a civilized society. To create an ideal society, he advocated for a government that acknowledged both the good and evil inherent in humanity. Taylor was unyielding in his conviction that a dualistic morality was essential, stating that governments, as they are shaped by human nature, would inevitably reflect both virtues and vices.\n\nAccording to Taylor, good principles were those that safeguarded private property, promoted agriculture, and discouraged capitalism. He believed a government founded on these principles would function fairly, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by self-interest. While self-interest was a fundamental human motivation, Taylor saw it as a problem only when it led to the creation of sub-societies that exploited others.\n\nA good government, in Taylor's view, was necessary to contain humanity's natural evil, and it must be closely monitored to prevent the introduction of corrupt principles. Like many fellow Republicans of his time, Taylor advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution, with a limited Federal government that only possessed the powers explicitly outlined in the document. He recognized that an expansive government would be costly and potentially tyrannical, but he also believed that a literal interpretation without consideration of the writers' intent could lead to corruption. Furthermore, Taylor considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it more explicitly described the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Going back to the data in Figure 17, we noticed a drastic decline in commuter log submissions during the third month of our project. It was a bit disheartening, and we couldn't quite put our finger on why this was happening. One factor that might have contributed to the decrease was the onset of winter at our New England campus, which tends to decrease the number of people commuting by bike or on foot. Additionally, December is a hectic time for students, with finals and grades to finish, making it easy for the commuter log to fall by the wayside. To make matters worse, December marks the start of the holiday season and a month-long break for students and faculty, leaving many without a reason to come to campus. Classes resumed in late January, but this didn't seem to translate into a significant increase in log submissions. We couldn't help but wonder if our project's initial excitement and momentum had naturally waned, much like a burst of energy that eventually fizzles out. To combat this trend, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a high-energy campaign that actually led to a spike in log submissions that month. However, we still struggled with maintaining project momentum in the face of the inevitable dip in engagement caused by semester breaks and holidays.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges we faced was the fact that people in our culture tend to love the independence and freedom that comes with driving their cars. To incentivize alternative modes of commuting, we offered a range of prizes, including gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, and bookstores. It would have been interesting to see how bigger prizes might have affected participation – perhaps a shiny new bike, a hybrid car, or an electric vehicle would have really gotten people excited and engaged. We stuck with the same prizes throughout the project, but if we had introduced more substantial rewards over time, we might have seen a different outcome. For instance, if we had announced a bicycle giveaway in December and a hybrid car in January, we could have potentially turned the trend around and seen an increase in participation instead of a decline.",
            "Imagine being able to invest in a security that combines the benefits of an index fund with the flexibility of a single stock, without the hefty price tag.  Enter the ETF, or exchange traded fund, a financial instrument designed to track a specific index, commodity, or basket of assets.  While it's true that ETFs offer diversification and the freedom to short sell, buy on margin, and even purchase a single share at a time - much like a traditional stock - they also come with a significantly lower expense ratio compared to the average mutual fund.  However, there are some trade-offs, such as the commission fees associated with buying and selling ETFs, just like stocks.\n\nOn the plus side, ETFs offer a dizzying array of investment options, giving investors a wide range to choose from.  But savvy investors know that it's essential to critically evaluate the benefits of any investment, including diversification, to ensure they truly deliver as promised.  In this analysis, we'll take a closer look at the ETF IHF and its top 10 holdings, which account for a staggering 63.58% of its total assets.  We'll examine whether investing in these top holdings can provide the same benefits as owning a diversified portfolio of the same stocks, and whether there are alternative configurations that could offer an even better return on investment.\n\nTo keep things manageable, we'll focus on the top 10 holdings, leaving out the smaller fish in the pond.  To get a better sense of how these stocks represent the ETF as a whole, we can use their current asset allocation to calculate their individual contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming a portfolio comprised solely of these 10 stocks in the same proportions as the ETF.  The results are enlightening, showing that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could deliver a whopping 16% higher return than the ETF, with a Beta that's a full 0.12 lower.\n\nBut can we be confident in these results?  To find out, we'll dive deeper by calculating the standard deviation of each top 10 stock and comparing it to the ETF's overall standard deviation.  Will our findings be statistically significant, or are they just a fluke?  Stay tuned to find out.",
            "I've often found myself pondering the literary works of Edgar Allan Poe, and 'Dream-Land' stands out as one of his notable poems. Poe himself considered it a personal standout. As I delved into the poem, I came across the term 'Thulé', which is repeated in lines 6 and 56. According to Thomas O. Mabbott, Poe drew inspiration from Virgil's use of the term to describe an island north of Britain, which the ancient Greeks believed marked the edge of the known world. However, there's another, more contemporary source that should be acknowledged - Poe's fascination with German authors.\n\nThis connection is significant because it highlights Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writing. In his book 'Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon', Karl J. Arndt points out the striking similarities between their poems, leading him to conclude that Poe was, in fact, drawing inspiration from Goethe. Interestingly, The Oxford Companion to English Literature notes that Goethe was a celebrated poet and playwright, best known for his masterpiece 'Faust', which was published in two parts - the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe's passing.\n\nWithin the second part of 'Faust' lies a haunting poem, 'The King of Thulé', which tells the tale of a king whose wife passes away after gifting him a goblet. Consumed by grief, the king becomes a heavy drinker and eventually decides to join his beloved queen in death. He leaves his possessions to his children, keeps the goblet as a reminder of his loss, and then takes his own life. The parallels between the King of Thulé and the protagonist of 'Dream-Land' are striking, almost as if Poe was drawing inspiration from Goethe's poem as a way to cope with his own loss and reliance on drink.\n\nIt's worth noting that Goethe's 'Faust' was adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe used the term 'Thule' in 'The Pit and the Pendulum'. Poe referenced Thule twice in his collected works, using 'ultima Thule' in 'The Pit and the Pendulum' and 'Dream-Land' as a repeated refrain. 'The King of Thulé' and 'Dream-Land' can be seen as companion pieces, with Goethe's poem serving as a precursor to Poe's exploration of themes such as loss, loneliness, and a world devoid of color.\n\nGiven Poe's admiration for Tennyson, it's likely that he was familiar with Goethe's work, even if only through reproductions of his writings that were widely available after the original publication. As I see it, Goethe's influence on Poe's poetry is undeniable, a testament to the power of literary connections that transcend time and geography.",
            "Under California law, a customer who slipped and fell on a puddle of applesauce in a grocery store could potentially be awarded punitive damages if they could show that the store manager acted with malice by ignoring a spill, even after being informed twice about it, because he was too busy eating dinner. But would a judge summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages?\n\nUnlikely. To win a punitive damage claim, Palmer would need to provide evidence that the store manager's actions demonstrated a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result, as well as a level of despicability. However, Palmer's case might hold up because she could argue that store manager Paul Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning the spill, given that multiple customers had slipped in similar incidents in the months leading up to her accident, and yet he still chose to do nothing.\n\nPalmer's argument that Martin's actions were despicable is not a slam dunk, but it's not entirely implausible either, especially considering that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred at the store in 2009, and Martin still failed to take adequate measures to ensure customer safety. A lower court decision from 1979, Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., suggests that conduct can be considered malicious if the defendant was aware of the probable consequences of their actions and willfully chose to ignore them.\n\nLet's look at the facts: on October 13, 2009, at 5 pm, an employee, Rick Wayne, informed Martin about the applesauce spill, but Martin claimed he was on dinner break and couldn't deal with it. An hour later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin about the spill, and he responded with the same excuse. It wasn't until 5:30 pm that the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Before her accident, there had been five similar slip-and-fall incidents at the store that year, and Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages. We're considering whether to file a motion to dismiss the punitive damage claim, but based on the facts, it's unlikely that a judge would do so without further review.",
            "It's been almost four years since I took a course in Islam at CBC, and the discussions we had in class still linger in my mind. The question of whether Islam is a hostile religion was a recurring theme. I believe this question has become increasingly relevant over the years, particularly in light of the events since 9/11. It's astonishing to see how the media's perception of Islam has shifted from being hostile to extremely tolerant in America. In 2001, it would have been unthinkable for a presidential candidate with a Muslim background, such as Barack Obama, to run for office.\n\nThe Biography of the Prophet has left me intrigued, as the account of Muhammad's life contradicts my initial understanding of his character. According to the biography, Muhammad is portrayed as a martyr who was often misunderstood and humble, rather than the conqueror I had previously thought. Instead of forcing conversions, people were drawn to his teachings, one by one. This characterization has led me to question the author's intentions, as it seems they're trying to present Muhammad as a gentle and endearing figure.\n\nI've noticed uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' attributed to Muhammad. The most striking example is the story of multiplying food for forty men, which is eerily reminiscent of Jesus' own miracles. This style of writing makes me wonder if the authors are downplaying the true miracle and significance of Jesus' life, essentially borrowing from his story to create a more palatable image of Muhammad.\n\nFurthermore, the biography often presents stories that seem designed to showcase 'witnesses' and conversions to Islam, but these accounts are often third-hand, based on hearsay and unverifiable testimonies. This approach diminishes the credibility of the stories and raises suspicions in my mind.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this work is the attempt to elevate Muhammad to a godly figure, portraying him as humble, wise, and gentle. However, historical records paint a different picture of Muhammad's rise to power, and I can't help but wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true complexities behind his story.",
            "It's striking how quickly the teachings of Jesus were lost in the shuffle as Christianity evolved after his lifetime. Looking back, we can see a clear pattern of Christianity drifting further and further away from its roots. Fast forward to today, and it's clear that there's an increasing awareness and a progressive shift underway. While traditionalists are holding tight to what they've been taught, their numbers might not be enough to sway the masses. In the years to come, Christians will increasingly become aware of the historical context of their faith, and a growing desire to strip away the excesses added to Christianity over time will emerge. It will take time – maybe decades or even centuries – but ultimately, the trend of Christian history will reverse itself. As the clock turns back, people will begin to peel away the layers of doctrine that have accumulated, leaving behind a more authentic representation of the message Jesus brought to humanity on behalf of God. When this shift gains momentum, it will sweep through the United States and Europe, influencing countless people to follow the original teachings of Jesus, unencumbered by centuries of added dogma. The church as an institution will continue to thrive, but its influence will be tempered by a renewed focus on the simplicity and unity of Jesus' message. Instead of the current diversity and fragmentation, we can expect to see more uniformity in Christian thought and practice across different regions, denominations, and divisions. History is full of examples of such reversals – think of how the Roman Empire once persecuted Christians, only to eventually adopt the faith. Similarly, our country has come a long way from slavery to equality. The great reversal that's on the horizon will be a fundamental shift in the Christian faith, one that will take us back to the source and, in the process, simplify and unify the faith. A key factor in this process will be a renewed appreciation for the metaphorical nature of Jesus' words, rather than taking them at face value. So, what happened to the original message of Jesus? By looking back to the early days before Jesus, we find that Judaism was the foundation of the Christian faith. The core components of monotheism, divinely revealed religion, and the authority of Hebrew scripture were already in place by the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. But within Judaism, there was no single, unified spirit – the community was divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a broader group of ordinary Jews.",
            "I believe that The Jungle exposes the harsh reality of human nature, revealing our innate tendency towards self-interest and greed. At our core, we're all about looking out for number one and making our lives as comfortable as possible, without much concern for those beneath us. The Jungle masterfully portrays this through various aspects of the story. The factory owners and managers are prime examples of this self-centeredness. Their sole focus is on expanding their businesses and increasing their wealth, no matter the cost. They show little regard for anything that stands in their way or suffers as a result of their actions. Upton Sinclair's vivid descriptions, such as \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world,\" paint a stark picture of the devastating impact of pollution on the environment. Sinclair highlights the owners' disregard for the well-being of people and animals caught in the crossfire of their pursuit of progress.\n\nThe owners and managers also demonstrate a callous disregard for their employees, who toil tirelessly to fuel their wealth. They're willing to do whatever it takes to save a buck, as Sinclair so poignantly puts it: \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They exploit their workers, forcing them to work grueling hours without notice, and then discard them like so much trash when they're no longer needed. In the era depicted in The Jungle, the lack of laws and regulations protecting workers' rights allowed the owners and managers to run amok, forcing their employees to sacrifice their well-being for the sake of progress. The book implies that those who toiled and died in Packingtown were expected to endure the deplorable conditions, both on the job and in their living environments, without any support or recourse. The absence of organizations or agencies to advocate for workers' welfare only exacerbated the situation, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation. Unions, which were supposed to be a beacon of hope, often proved to be a disappointment, preying on the very people they were supposed to protect. The workers were effectively trapped in a system akin to slavery, with immorality and desperation becoming an inevitable consequence, as Sinclair so starkly puts it: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers.\"",
            "When authors attempt to convey their thoughts and opinions to readers, they often resort to a variety of techniques to achieve the desired effect. Some of these methods are more effective than others, and F. Scott Fitzgerald is a master of using them in his writing. In his iconic novel, The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald employs several of these techniques to shape readers' perceptions of significant themes and characters. One of these techniques is pairing an adjective with a noun in a way that defies convention, evoking a specific atmosphere around a subject. Another approach is assigning meaning to a symbol and then leveraging it to convey a particular emotion or idea. Fitzgerald's use of colors is a prime example of this latter technique, with gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink playing key roles in the novel.\n\nFitzgerald skillfully builds up meaning for the colors white/gray, which he later uses to evoke a sense of uniformity, class, and age in important scenes. At the beginning of the novel, we see the author consistently using both colors to set the tone. For instance, Daisy and Jordan are frequently described as being \"in white,\" and the list of white-clad characters is extensive - Nick dons \"white flannels\" at Gatsby's party, Tom sports a \"white shirt\" when meeting Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white.\" Even everyday objects and settings take on a uniform hue, such as the \"white chasms of lower New York\" Nick navigates on his way to work and the \"gray names\" on his party guest list. This widespread use of white and gray helps to create a sense of monotony and class distinction.\n\nHowever, as the novel progresses, Fitzgerald uses these colors to signify the unimportance or uniformity of certain characters and themes. This shift begins with Daisy, who, after a lull in her appearances, is reintroduced as \"dressed in white\" in a \"little white roadster.\" This portrayal reinforces the notion that Daisy has become a uniform, unremarkable figure in Gatsby's life, rather than a fully fleshed-out character. The use of a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" and her subsequent appearances in a \"white\" dress serve to further underscore this impression, making the reader see her as a mere accessory to Gatsby's desires rather than a fully realized individual.",
            "San Diego County is a gardener's paradise, where the sun shines bright and the harvest is bountiful. The region is home to a wide variety of crops, including the sweet taste of fresh tomatoes, juicy citrus fruits, crisp leafy greens, and an array of squash and broccoli varieties. Herbs, tree fruits, and berries are also in abundance, as well as the golden nectar of honey and the spicy kick of peppers. It's no wonder that the demand for organic community-supported agriculture is high in the area, with many local organizations struggling to keep up with lengthy waiting lists for their fresh produce. Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand, and some farms even offer tours of their operations, allowing visitors to hike, birdwatch, and connect with nature.\n\nThe benefits of organic farming are numerous, but it's not without its challenges. Without relying on chemicals, organic farms require more labor and management to keep pests and weeds under control and the soil fertile. This can lead to higher costs and greater losses, especially for small-scale operations that can't match the efficiency of larger conventional farms. However, the payoff is well worth it, as organic farming promotes biodiversity and creates a healthier environment for both plants and wildlife.\n\nFor a small landowner in the San Diego area, the goal is to find a balance between profitability and environmental sustainability. A 160-acre parcel of land adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California, offers a prime opportunity to do just that. The property features a mix of chaparral, non-native grassland, and oak woodland, and is surrounded by the Cleveland National Forest. The East County Southern Foothills ecoregion is home to over a hundred species of plants and animals, many of which are endangered or declining, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the California gnatcatcher.\n\nThis land has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries and later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. As part of an original homestead patent, the land was likely used for grazing and wood production for many years. Today, a small farmer might seek financial assistance and expertise to mitigate costs and preserve the property's wildlife-friendly operations. I chose a model farm in the same area to demonstrate the possibilities.",
            "In any negotiation, culture plays a pivotal role. But what is culture, really? It's not a fixed entity; it's a dynamic, multifaceted thing that reveals itself through what it encompasses, as much as what it excludes. It's far from homogenous or singular; rather, it's a rich tapestry of complexities and nuances. Reducing a culture to simplistic generalizations – \"Russians are stubborn\" or \"the Japanese are accommodating\" – is a gross oversimplification. While it's essential to grasp a culture's general essence, it's more productive for a negotiator to delve deeper, understanding how that culture's values and attitudes will shape the negotiation process. When we encounter a foreign culture, we inevitably draw comparisons to our own, and this can lead to misunderstandings.\n\nDelving into a culture involves immersing yourself in its history, its prejudices, and its idiosyncrasies. Rather than judging or trying to change it, a negotiator must accept it for what it is and work within its boundaries, especially when the stakes are high or the bargaining position is weak. When operating in unfamiliar territory, a genuine respect for a culture's traditions and values can be a game-changer, helping to bridge cultural divides and propel the negotiation forward.\n\nIt's also essential to recognize that culture isn't solely defined by national or international borders. Corporate culture, for instance, can be a distinct entity within a given nation. A company's emphasis on long work hours or a relaxed schedule, its dress code, communication style, and hiring practices can all reveal its unique culture. Even within the United States, corporate culture can vary significantly from company to company and within regions, highlighting the intricate diversity of thought within a societal culture. What appears uniform or monolithic on the surface can hide a complex web of values and attitudes waiting to be uncovered.\n\nUnderstanding values is crucial, as they provide the underlying motivations of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony is paramount, a negotiator will think twice before publicly embarrassing their company or superior. Conversely, in cultures where a hard-won bargain is prized, negotiators may resist settling for a compromise. By considering these cultural nuances ahead of time, a negotiator can navigate the negotiation table with greater finesse. However, to truly succeed, it's also essential to develop a personal connection with the opposing party, as this can make the negotiation more effective.",
            "We often hear the saying, 'There is no God,' but it's a notion also echoed by the likes of St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas, two thinkers who dedicated their work to proving the existence of a higher power. In this comparison, we'll assume both are correct in their belief in the Christian God, and focus on whose argument is more convincing. To ensure a fair comparison, let's start with the understanding that we're discussing their views on the Christian God specifically.\n\nLooking through the lens of their writings, it becomes apparent that neither St. Anselm nor Thomas Aquinas provides a comprehensive basis for faith. To illustrate this point, let's examine their arguments. St. Anselm's argument revolves around the idea that the existence of God is found within our own understanding, a notion he derived from faith. According to him, we can prove God's existence by looking within ourselves, believing that the concept of God is inherently known to be true. This idea is often referred to as faith, which, by definition, doesn't rely on empirical evidence. In essence, Anselm suggests that we don't need to look elsewhere for truth – it's within our own minds.\n\nIn stark contrast, Thomas Aquinas presents a more traditional and evidence-based approach. He argues that the existence of God can be proven through reason and empirical evidence alone, eliminating the need for faith. This would make it easier to convert new followers, as his arguments are based on logic rather than unproven assumptions. Aquinas lists five logical arguments in support of God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. His core idea is that the proof of God lies in the inherent logic that dictates the existence of a higher power.",
            "It's a story that spans over 2,500 years, one that begins in the ancient times of the 5th or 6th century BCE. A young prince, destined to be known as Buddha, was born, and his life would take a dramatic turn when he renounced the world to find enlightenment. His teachings would shape the foundation of Buddhism, the most traditional branch of which is Theravada Buddhism. Fast forward to the present, and it's clear that the religion has undergone a significant transformation over the centuries. This transformation is evident in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed, a tradition that has little to do with the teachings of Buddha. The fissures between the original teachings and the modern practices run deep, from the surface-level customs to the core principles of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, comprising both monks and lay individuals, has had to adapt its principles over time, influenced by both internal and external forces.\n\nAs we delve into the discussion, it's essential to grasp the nuances of the terms that will be used. An internal force refers to a change driven by the Buddhist community itself, whether monks or laypeople. External forces, on the other hand, originate from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that intentionally harm or seek to damage the community, often driven by a negative perception of Buddhism. Benign forces, while not necessarily beneficial, do not aim to harm and might even inadvertently contribute to the community's growth.\n\nTo gain a deeper understanding of Theravada Buddhism, let's start with the core principles. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma encompasses the Tripitaka, a collection of three baskets of sacred texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka explores the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism, including concepts like Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). By grasping these fundamental ideas, one can break free from Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, and ultimately overcome lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for laypeople, such as the five precepts (do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not engage in misconduct, and do not consume intoxicating substances). For monks, there are additional rules to follow. At the heart of Buddhism lies the four noble truths: Dukkha (life is suffering), attachment causes suffering, and suffering can be overcome.",
            "The long-standing feud between the United States and Mexico, a bitter rivalry that spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893, is a telling example of two nations that couldn't seem to see eye-to-eye. In fact, things came to a head during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, when the United States successfully invaded Mexico, securing Texas and the American Southwest as its new territory (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145). But this wasn't the only clash between the two nations; there were many more skirmishes and power struggles throughout their history, which finally started to subside just before World War I. \n\nWhat set off this rivalry was a clash of fundamental values and interests, particularly when it came to religion, culture, and tradition (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31). Sound familiar? It's a pattern that's repeated in many other nations that share a border with their neighbors. Where lines are drawn, interests collide, and rival positions emerge. The US and Mexico are not unique in this regard; David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that only a handful of nations, including Mexico and Cuba, have been able to sustain long-term diplomatic headaches for the United States (p. 41). Geography plays a significant role in these lasting rivalries, and the proximity of these nations to the US is no coincidence. \n\nOne major point of contention between the two nations was their differing views on religion, a source of discord that has plagued many nations throughout history. As Sally Frahm (2001) points out, in the 18th and 19th centuries, Americans were just as opposed to Catholicism and monarchies as they were to fascism and communism in the 20th century (p. 86). The ideological struggles between the US and Mexico were akin to the Cold War's East-West standoff, but with a twist - instead of a battle between politics, it was a clash of faiths. This underlying distrust was inherited from their former colonial rulers, the English and Spanish, making it a major hurdle to establishing a harmonious relationship between the two nations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) catalogued an astonishing 17 disputes between Mexico and the US during this 57-year period, with the majority of these conflicts centered around territorial issues and border raids from Mexican territory. The violence and lawlessness on both sides of the border were a persistent problem that wasn't fully resolved until both countries exerted military force to maintain order (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97).\n\nIt wasn't until Mexico became increasingly dependent on the US that the rivalry began to fade, and by the late 19th century, American ambitions had shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico, effectively ending the bitter rivalry (Schmitt, 1974, p. 109-110).",
            "It's been fifteen long years since I was unexpectedly laid low by a mysterious illness that I never saw coming. At the time, I was a nurse, having chosen that career path because it seemed like a safe and secure way to make a living. I'd often heard the same mantra growing up: \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\" While I had bigger dreams - I longed to be a scientist or a journalist - this was the path I took. \n\nNow, at 46 and single, with no savings to speak of, I've been living on disability benefits for over a decade. I'm still struggling to get by, with every passing day feeling like an exhausting battle for my security, safety, and self-worth. The thought of uncertainty looms over me, yet I'm reminded of a hard-won truth: without the unwavering support of my family and a few kind friends, I wouldn't have made it this far. When disaster strikes, it's easy to feel overwhelmed, and I know I'm not alone in that feeling.\n\nMy point is this: no matter how prepared you are, life's emergencies - big and small - are inevitable. There are no guarantees, and some challenges are just too great to face alone.\n\nWhile I agree that we should be cautious about relying too heavily on the government, I firmly believe that we'd be better off fostering a culture of mutual support and trust. Rather than each of us going it alone, we should be learning to rely on one another and ask for help when we need it.\n\nThe conservatives in the US often romanticize the idea of rugged individualism that supposedly built this country, but the truth is that our forebears relied on compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources to get through tough times. Those pioneers who trekked across the Rocky Mountains didn't make it to the coast without the help of their fellow travelers.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I've got my disaster kit, first aid supplies, and a stash of emergency supplies. If you have the means, consider growing your own food or investing in a wood stove. But don't forget the most important thing: get to know your neighbors, and be willing to lend a hand (or ask for one) when you need it.",
            "The age-old question remains: why do organisms evolve the way they do? Are there any boundaries or constraints that dictate the direction of evolutionary change? It's a mystery that has puzzled scientists for over a century – even the renowned biologist D'Arcy Thompson noted in 1917 that \"even now, the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms.\" Yet, despite the passage of time, we still don't have a clear answer.\n\nRecently, however, scientists have started to use mathematical modeling to better understand the intricate dance of evolutionary change in organisms. One group of researchers, for instance, has applied mathematical modeling to the development of mollusk shells, examining both their growth patterns and evolutionary history (Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our own study is taking a similar approach, combining mathematical modeling with experimental research to uncover the underlying mechanisms that drive evolutionary change in the snail genus Prunum.\n\nWe used X-ray images of Prunum species to identify key characteristics that can be used to model hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. These parameters were then fed into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995), allowing us to create virtual shell shapes that can be used to explore the boundaries of possible morphological change.\n\nIn essence, a shell can be thought of as a spiral tube that grows over time, with each coil or whorl representing a specific point in the organism's life history. The central axis of the shell, known as the columella, runs through its center, and each whorl is separated by a continuous line called a suture. The speed at which these whorls grow can vary, and the largest whorl is typically the last one (the body whorl).\n\nWhen examining a shell, we can view it from different angles: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The most common orientation is apertural, where the opening of the shell faces the viewer, with the tip of the spire pointing upwards.\n\nTo count the whorls, we start by viewing the shell from the apical angle and identifying the first suture. We then draw a line dividing the shell into two parts, and count the whorls from this line, estimating each one to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can also be seen as a series of openings that move through time and space as the organism builds its shell. By tracking the coordinates of each whorl's aperture, as well as its horizontal and vertical radius, we can create a mathematical representation of the shell's growth trajectory. This allows us to manipulate the parameters of shell development and explore the possibilities of evolutionary change.",
            "We've been staring at some disturbing statistics for a decade, and it's time we take a closer look. Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have been stuck in a rut for the past ten years, and while the country is inching towards meeting some of the Millennium Development Goals, progress in child and maternal health is woefully off track. The harsh reality is that the country's approach needs a serious overhaul – it's time to shift focus from program-specific fixes to strengthening the health system as a whole. \n\nIndonesia's made some headway in getting skilled health workers present during births, with 72% of births now meeting this standard. But don't be fooled – this figure includes traditional midwives who can't provide medical interventions when complications arise, leading to a disproportionate number of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage. What's more, the percentage of children under five treated for diarrheal cases has taken a hit, and postnatal care is a dark area where data is scarce, with low rates across the country.\n\nThe alarming low rate of cesarean sections, at around 4%, points to a deeper issue. The rate is 7% in urban areas, but a mere 2% in rural regions, highlighting the glaring disparities in healthcare access. It's clear that urban areas are getting the lion's share of healthcare services, leaving rural communities in the dust. The issue of vertical equity further exacerbates the problem, with a staggering 27% gap between the poorest and richest quintiles – the poor are finding it nearly impossible to access healthcare due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nSo, what's next for Indonesia? The most pressing question is how to address the glaring lack of access to healthcare services. Should the country focus on program-specific approaches or take a more holistic approach to strengthening the health system? While targeted, vertically-oriented programs have their appeal, they come with significant drawbacks. For one, investing heavily in one area often means neglecting others, and human resources get sucked into areas with more funding. Furthermore, running multiple parallel programs leads to duplication and disorganization, resulting in a logistical nightmare.",
            "Victorian novels are characterized by an intense focus on the intricacies of the upper class during that era. However, two notable exceptions are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  These novels deviate from the norm by incorporating elements of mystery and the bizarre, which serves to deepen our understanding of the characters' motivations and emotions. This unique approach allows readers to gain a more profound insight into the inner workings of their minds.\n\nAs Oliver Twist navigated the treacherous world of Victorian London, his mind became a jumble of confusing and bewildering thoughts. He found himself lost in a haze of hallucinations, reliving fragments of his past and struggling to distinguish reality from fantasy. In one particularly vivid sequence, the sound of gunfire shattered the silence, and Oliver was swept away by an unseen force. His senses were overwhelmed, and he was left reeling from the pain and fear that seemed to have become an integral part of his existence.\n\nThis use of dreamlike states in Oliver Twist serves to highlight Oliver's feelings of powerlessness and despair. His inability to control the events that unfolded around him is a refrain that echoes throughout the novel. The shooting itself becomes a symbol of the hopelessness that has consumed Oliver, a reminder that he is a pawn in a much larger game. His lack of agency is further underscored by his inability to react, even when his very life is at stake. It is as if Fagin's influence has worn him down, leaving him a broken and defeated individual.\n\nIn Wuthering Heights, the dreamlike sequences take on a different form. The passage describing the long and sleepless night that followed the tumultuous events of the day is a testament to the author's ability to craft a sense of atmosphere and mood. The words \"day\" and \"night\" become interchangeable, blurring the lines between reality and fantasy. This sense of disorientation serves to underscore the characters' emotional states, which are as turbulent as the weather that surrounds them.",
            "It's a memory that still sticks out in my mind - working in an after-school program, trying to help elementary-age students with their studies. I did my best to assist them in areas where they needed improvement, but my strengths lay in English and reading. However, one student in particular - a boy named Adrian, whom I believe was in the third or fourth grade at the time - proved to be a puzzle. He was having trouble reading, but what struck me as odd was the way he struggled with certain letters, while others seemed to come easily to him. His fluency in English was impressive, considering I suspected he was of Latino descent. \n\nAs I worked with him, it became increasingly clear that something was amiss. We made little progress until the day his mother walked in, speaking only Spanish. With my limited Spanish skills, we managed to communicate, and I had a revelation: Adrian could read just fine, but he was struggling with the English alphabet. I'm not sure how much this insight helped him in the long run, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the issue of the language barrier in schools, especially in California. It's not always as straightforward as we might think, even for students who speak perfect English. Reading can be a significant obstacle, and I'm sure everyone agrees that this is a problem. So, what's the solution? For Adrian, it was as simple as extra tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for students who barely speak English, the answer is much more complex.\n\nThere's no one-size-fits-all solution to this problem. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes - none of these approaches can fix the issue on their own. The key lies in combining them all. \n\nFirstly, the dual language system is a great concept, not just for children who speak Spanish as their first language, but for all students. Research has shown that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Many people fear that these programs are a waste of resources, claiming that the majority of students won't benefit. But that's just not true. If we implemented these programs as the norm, rather than the exception, all students would benefit. So, how do we make this work? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? No, that's unrealistic. But I do think it's reasonable to have bilingual assistants, tutors, or whatever you want to call them, to support our teachers.",
            "As we grow up, many of us are told that there's something greater than ourselves out there, something beyond our understanding. Some of us attend Sunday school, while others seek answers in temples or within their own minds. Many of us adopt the faith handed down to us by our parents, but others reject it entirely, believing that there's only what we can grasp within our own egocentric world. Our values can shift over time, and we may go on to find new meaning in different spiritual paths. We're on a journey to discover ourselves through our own unique perspectives on the mysteries of existence and to find a guiding light in the darkness.\n\nI still remember a conversation I had with my dad about his favorite type of bird – the cardinal. We sat on our front porch, listening to the rain drumming on the tin roof as we both smoked our cigarettes. The rain poured down from the gutters, drowning the plants on the edge of the porch. My dad gazed out into the rain, his expression a mix of searching and remembering. He'd lost weight and his clothes hung loosely on his frail body. His hair had thinned out, too. I sensed his pain and my own fear as we sat there in silence. I felt a lump in my throat, unable to bring up the topic of how much I'd miss him – talking about it would only make it more real for both of us. I hugged him, moved my chair closer to his, and sat down beside him, both of us lost in the rain's rhythmic beat.\n\nMy dad passed away that December, just five days after my 22nd birthday. The chemotherapy and radiation had prolonged his life beyond the doctors' predictions, but it was a hollow extension – what was the value in mere survival when he suffered so much? I remember questioning a God who would allow this. Alone at night, I didn't say any prayers. If God existed, I thought, he'd stopped listening to me a long time ago.\n\nI didn't want to witness my dad's passing, so I didn't. I couldn't watch the man who'd given me life slip away. I chose to remember him by how he lived, not how he died. I knew my dad better than anyone else; I knew he wouldn't have wanted me to be a spectator at his death. For three days, I curled up in bed, waiting for the news. But no one even called me.",
            "I've always thought that the term \"Gothic Novel\" is a perfect oxymoron - \"old\" and \"new\" all wrapped into one. As Ian Watt so aptly puts it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, this genre is a paradox that has been met with both disdain and adoration. Some have dismissed it as lacking substance, while others have praised it for evoking the 'terrible sublime' (a concept Burke explored). The roots of the Gothic genre date back to Horace Walpole's novel, The Castle of Otranto, which cleverly merged elements from both ancient and modern romances to create something entirely new. By combining the old theatrical flair of medieval gothic theatre with the modern novel's ability to delve into character psychology, Walpole managed to craft a style that would endure for centuries, despite being both obsolete and innovative at the same time.\n\nOne of the key elements that defines the Gothic genre is the concept of chivalry. In the medieval era, chivalry represented the epitome of knighthood - bravery, honor, and competence. However, as Walpole and other Gothic writers saw it, this ideal had largely disappeared from modern society. In his novel, The Castle of Otranto, Walpole romanticized the gothic past, using chivalric concepts to critique the present. This was particularly relevant given the tumultuous times in which he wrote - a period marked by political upheaval and unfair accusations. Walpole's character, Frederic, is a prime example of this idealized chivalry. Described as a prince who has suffered greatly, he embodies the traditional chivalric traits - courtesy, gallantry, and a sense of justice. However, his portrayal is also exaggerated, introducing the concept of excess that would become a staple of the Gothic genre.",
            "I still remember the early 80s when the concept of supply chain management burst onto the scene, revolutionizing the way goods moved from raw materials to customer satisfaction. Keith Oliver, a visionary consultant, coined the term in 1982, and it has been a game-changer ever since. He described the intricate process of planning, implementing, and controlling the supply chain to deliver what customers want, quickly and efficiently. The supply chain is a complex web of six interconnected elements: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Savvy business managers master these elements to provide top-notch customer service.\n\nProduction is the foundation of the supply chain, where everything begins. It's the when, why, where, and how of production, setting the stage for the entire process. To get it right, managers need to tap into customer demand, and the market is the best barometer for that. By analyzing market trends and customer needs, managers can decide what products to produce, in what quantities, and where to produce them – all while keeping customer satisfaction top of mind. It's a delicate balance, but one that's crucial to success. I should know; I've seen it firsthand in my previous stints at retail heavyweights like Wal-Mart and Target. These companies have meticulous processes in place, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments from trucks. It's a well-oiled machine that hums along smoothly when every detail is planned to perfection.\n\nThe supply element is another key cog in the supply chain machine. It's all about making strategic decisions about your core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. A company might have multiple divisions for a single product, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers must choose which division is the best fit for each process, and sometimes, that means outsourcing to other companies. The goal is to create velocity – delivering high-quality products with flexibility and keeping costs low.",
            "There's a jarring message scrawled on a cardboard sign held aloft by Ellen Page, a Juno actress, on a city street corner. The somber words, scribbled with a Sharpie, declare: 'Hitler is alive in Burma'. Burma, or Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation plagued by a ruthless military dictatorship that seized power in 1962 through a bloody coup d'état. In 2007, a wave of street protests erupted, the first public demonstrations in over a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests were dubbed 'The Saffron Revolution' after the color of their traditional robes. As the public's interest in the protests grew, the Burmese government initially allowed the monks to gather peacefully, but the situation soon escalated into a brutal conflict between the monks and the military junta, with the military invading and ransacking monasteries across the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned, and a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was tragically killed on September 27, 2007, simply for witnessing a street protest. While the official death toll is reported to be 13, Colonel Hla Win, a former army defector, alleged that many more people were killed, with the bodies numbering in the thousands.\n\nThis is nothing new. A government's insatiable desire to suppress dissent and maintain total control over its citizens has been a recurring theme throughout human history. Ancient Roman emperors claimed divine right to absolute power over every aspect of their society. In Japan, emperors are still revered as deities, sent to lead their people to prosperity through innovation and self-discipline. Our current president, George W. Bush, reportedly held regular conference calls with Ted Haggard, a prominent Christian leader, who was once at the helm of Stupid People Worldwide, a fringe organization with ties to the Republican Party.\n\nSome of the most shocking examples of these actions include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where students, intellectuals, and labor activists gathered to challenge the authoritarian rule of the Chinese government. The death toll from that event varies wildly, with official reports ranging from 200-300 to reports from the Chinese Red Cross, which estimated between 2,000-3,000 dead. Another harrowing example is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, backed by the Rwandan government, systematically targeted and killed Tutsis and political moderates, regardless of their ethnic backgrounds. The atrocities committed during Hitler's 'Third Reich' are another extreme example of a government's brutal suppression of dissent and minority groups.",
            "Duke Ellington's timeless contribution to jazz is largely due to his remarkable longevity and, by extension, his boundless creativity in shaping his orchestra. Though his piano presence is understated in many of the compositions featured here, Ellington excelled as a composer by crafting rich, intricate pieces that showcased the distinct talents of his band members. He skillfully created a framework where soloists could improvise freely, while also writing tightly orchestrated sections that highlighted the unique styles of individual musicians. This approach not only allowed him to emphasize the overall tone of the orchestra but also resulted in coherent and original sounds that perfectly suited each piece. Ellington's mastery of the individual players' voices and how they blended together in a growing ensemble enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative approach to sound and his use of voice as a jazz instrument in his long career, citing Creole Love Call as a prime example. This early piece showcases Ellington's ability to incorporate voice without lyrics, adding texture and depth to the music. The song's twelve-bar blues structure, featuring six distinct choruses, demonstrates Ellington's skill in complementing the style of his soloists. The choruses unfold as follows:\n\nChorus 1: A call-and-response exchange between voice and reeds, with the voice beginning smooth and melodic before transitioning to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo elaborates on the basic melody, emphasizing several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus, with a call-and-response between the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus, as the reeds initiate the call-and-response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call-and-response between voice and reeds. In this final chorus, the voice takes on the sound of the \"growl\" technique, soloing as an instrument.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to his music is a hallmark of his style. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, he combines his skill in tight orchestration with his ear for tone color, creating a rich and complementary sound through a call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "For as long as she could remember, there was a gnawing sense of discontent within her. This hollowness refused to be filled, lingering since her early teenage years. By the time she was 17, it had become a persistent ache that wouldn't subside. She began to realize that what she craved wasn't a thing, but a connection – a human connection that eluded her. Yet, she found herself unresponsive to the boys who showed interest, leaving her puzzled about what was missing. She often found herself questioning her own desires, searching for answers that seemed to evade her, even as the years went by. Theories emerged, but none provided a satisfactory explanation for this peculiar phenomenon.\n\nHer home life was usually a serene bubble. Her parents were calm and peaceful, rarely arguing with each other. When they did have disagreements, they were usually with her, stemming from their desire to let her spread her wings and be her free-spirited self. They balanced each other out, but she added her own unique energy to the mix – a lively, lovable, and kind-hearted individual who brought warmth to those around her.\n\nHowever, today was different. As she wandered from room to room, seeking inspiration, the sound of her mother's distressed cry pierced the air from the kitchen. She rushed in, panic setting in as she frantically asked, \"Mom, what's wrong?!\" Her mother lay on the ground, wincing in pain, repeating \"Ow\" in short, labored gasps. Her daughter rushed to her side, placing a supporting hand on her mother's shoulder. \"Ouch... sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital,\" her mother managed to say, her words strained and urgent. The daughter sprang into action, grateful for the strength she'd gained from prior training, as she carefully lifted her mother and helped her to the car.\n\nThe hospital's antiseptic scent and eerie atmosphere hung in the air, weighed down by an undercurrent of fear. Yet, her focus remained on her mother's well-being as she quickly guided her into a treatment room and called for medical help. The doctors and nurses rushed in, and soon her mother was being tended to, while she sat anxiously waiting.\n\nIt turned out her mother had taken a tumble off a stool while trying to retrieve a vase from the top cabinet.",
            "I've always been fascinated by the profound impact of diet on our well-being, particularly when it comes to the Mediterranean diet, also known as \"Med diet.\" This study aimed to uncover the relationship between adherence to a modified version of the Med diet, dubbed the \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet,\" and the risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke. The aMed diet is characterized by a higher intake of plant-based foods, monounsaturated fats, and fish, alongside a lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate amounts of alcohol are also allowed.\n\nPast studies have demonstrated a clear inverse correlation between adherence to the Med diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. Another study showed that the Med diet outperformed a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. However, previous research has focused primarily on mortality and weight loss, leaving the relationship between the Med diet and stroke or stroke mortality largely unexplored.\n\nThis study followed a staggering 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study that observes 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Over the course of 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, the researchers computed an aMed diet score six times, using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" that gauged nutrient intake over the preceding year. An impressive 95% of the nurses remained part of the study throughout this period. The questionnaires were validated through medical and hospital records, autopsy reports, and death certificates. For cases where records were unavailable, \"probable\" cases were included, accounting for around 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts.\n\nTo minimize random variation and better capture long-term dietary intake, the researchers calculated cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated questionnaires. They also adjusted for potential confounders, such as age, smoking status, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing Cox proportional-hazard modeling, the researchers examined the association between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, with separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. The results showed that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was linked to a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. During the 20-year follow-up period, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were identified. Women in the top aMed quintile were at a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "It's hard to believe it's been over a decade since the United States was rocked by a devastating financial crisis. The job market was decimated, the housing market imploded, and some of the country's biggest and most influential corporations were left reeling. As we look back, it's time to ask the tough questions: what led to this disaster, and how can we prevent it from happening again? In a nutshell, the crisis was a direct result of reckless and naive decision-making by politicians who put pressure on banks and financial institutions to issue sub-prime loans into a fragile and underdeveloped financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac got caught up in the chaos, forced to buy and repackage these dodgy mortgages into complex financial instruments like CDOs and CDSs. When homebuyers defaulted on these loans, the banks were left with huge losses, which they then passed on to the rest of the economy.\n\nLooking back, the roots of the financial crisis lay in the late 1990s, when President Clinton was looking to secure a second term in office. To boost his popularity, his administration relaxed lending regulations, setting the stage for the sub-prime disaster that would unfold seven years later. Stephen Holmes of the New York Times sounded the alarm in 1999, warning that Fannie Mae was under pressure to expand mortgage lending to low-income borrowers and maintain its profits. He foresaw the consequences of this reckless approach: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As we now know, ill-advised lending would ultimately lead to an economic meltdown.\n\nA perfect storm of factors contributed to the economic collapse, including the proliferation of complex mortgage products like adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These instruments tied more and more sectors of the economy to the housing market, leaving households and financial markets overexposed and vulnerable to even minor changes in the housing market. When the housing bubble burst, the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were left reeling. The five biggest U.S. investment banks reported a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, equivalent to about 30% of the country's GDP. In the end, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at fire-sale prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to transform into commercial banks subject to tough regulations. Fannie and Freddie were saddled with $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were taken under government control in September 2008.",
            "The pitfalls of exposition - that great expanse of narrative where the unwary writer's wings can falter, leaving readers yawning and scrambling for the \"Back\" button.  Dr. Merlin has been known to let out a frustrated cry at her screen when she finds herself bogged down in a sea of unnecessary detail. Exposition can be a necessary evil, but it's not exactly the most exciting part of writing.\n\nEven seasoned authors like Dr. Merlin often struggle with the temptation to dump too much information on their readers, forgetting the cardinal rule: \"Show, don't tell.\"  The goal is to engage, not to lecture or recite a laundry list of facts. Exposition is like that pesky little voice in your head that says, \"Let's get this over with, so we can get to the good stuff.\" But what's the \"good stuff\" if not a rich tapestry of characters, plot, and emotion?\n\nTake, for instance, a scenario where a writer tells us that a heroine met her beloved at a certain time and place, got married in a grand ceremony, and then had her husband brutally murdered in front of her eyes.  Would it be wise to spend two pages on this sequence, with nary a word of dialogue between the two?  Probably not.  Instead, the author should take the time to flesh out the husband's character - his words, his mannerisms, the way he loves his wife.  We should see the heroine's transformation, her growth, her dependence on him.  By doing so, we become invested in their relationship, their fate, and the heroine's emotional journey.\n\nIn short, we crave more than just the bare bones of a storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"  We want the meat that makes it real, that makes us care.  So, as writers, let's resist the urge to speed through the exposition and focus on crafting a narrative that truly comes alive.",
            "I caught two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was NBC 4, live this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was a disturbing one about a man in Ashley, Ohio who'd stabbed his wife. The news team didn't reveal her name, but showed a mugshot of the perpetrator, Shad Hostettler. He looked every bit the part of a malevolent figure. The report was concise, lasting only about two minutes, as the story was still unfolding. I thought they gave it enough airtime.\n\nThe next story I saw was about an 18-year-old named Travis Buyers, who'd been shot in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically injured but no arrests had been made. The SWAT Team was on the case. This particular story seemed short-lived, and I suspect it might have been due to the fact that the victim and the neighborhood were from a minority background. I've noticed for years that crimes committed against minorities often get glossed over, while the media goes into frenzy when a white victim is involved.\n\nThe news cycle then shifted to a story about a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. They provided details about where the incident likely occurred and revealed that a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle was to blame. Crime-Stoppers was offering a substantial reward for any information leading to the shooter's capture.\n\nNext up was a brief report about the impending rain and thunderstorms forecasted for Saturday afternoon. The temperature was expected to remain steady in the mid to low eighties for the weekend, but they seemed to be teasing the story rather than providing a thorough update.\n\nThey also ran with a story about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The perpetrator was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie and standing about six feet tall and weighing 150 pounds. I was struck by how much emphasis was placed on his skin color and the fact that he was dark-skinned. It seemed an unusual amount of time was dedicated to these unnecessary details.\n\nAnother story featured Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin, who'd been found guilty of conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. I was puzzled by the way his sentence was reported - instead of saying he was sentenced to 25 years in prison, they said \"300 months.\" I'm not sure if they thought this phrasing sounded harsher or if it was just a quirk. They also highlighted his Hispanic heritage, but I'm not convinced it was relevant to the story.",
            "The connection between brothers is a complex and unbreakable one, woven with threads of love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. It's a bond that transcends words and understanding, one that can only be truly grasped by those who have experienced it firsthand. Brothers have a unique ability to see themselves reflected in one another, a characteristic that becomes starkly apparent in the most trying of times. Whether the emotions that arise from this bond are positive or negative, they come with a steep price. To truly comprehend the intricacies of fraternal love, one must confront the consequences that come with it. Looking into the eyes of a brother is like gazing into a mirror, revealing a person's true nature, beyond the façade that others may see. It's in their actions and the aftermath of those actions that a person's character is truly revealed. \n\nIn James Hurst's poignant tale, \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" this theme is masterfully explored through the complex relationships between two brothers. Against the backdrop of a lush, vividly described landscape, their journey unfolds as a poignant exploration of the messy emotions that accompany brotherhood. Bitter disappointment and intense pride collide in a heart-wrenching climax, resulting in a sobering conclusion that leaves only one brother standing. The narrative weaves together a nuanced portrait of the protagonist and his younger brother, Doodle, whose fragile existence is marked by a weak heart that renders him unsuitable for the physical pursuits that the older brother had envisioned for them. The older brother's desire for a companion to share in his adventures is met with crushing disappointment, leading him to harbor feelings of resentment towards his sibling. His anger is almost palpable, as he recalls contemplating the unthinkable – suffocating Doodle with a pillow. However, a single, radiant smile from his brother is enough to melt his resolve, revealing a glimmer of the love that lies beneath his surface. This tender moment suggests that his capacity for cruelty may not be as strong as he initially thought. Throughout the narrative, the reader is left to ponder the complexities of brotherly love and the far-reaching consequences that it entails.",
            "We've all seen the incredible complexity of the human brain. As technology has advanced, so have the metaphors we use to describe it. From the primitive wax tablet to the modern computer, our understanding of the brain has evolved significantly. However, it's essential to remember that these metaphors have their limitations and can lead to misconceptions.\n\nWhen sensory information enters our brains, it's like a puzzle, with our sensory organs transforming physical stimuli into electrochemical signals. The brain's algorithms process this information in layers, both from the bottom up and from the top down. For instance, when gazing at a picture of a black box on a white background, the brain's bottom-up processing starts by identifying the colors, orientation, and borders of the object, ultimately concluding that you're looking at a box. Meanwhile, top-down processing uses the decisions made at earlier stages to speed up your recognition, determining whether you're looking at a box or a hole in the background.\n\nOnce the brain has processed the information to a certain degree, an attention filter kicks in to determine which signals are most important and which cognitive processes should be engaged. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. On the other hand, you might pick out your name even in a noisy room.\n\nThe brain's processing is a multi-stage process, with results modulated by attention at each stage. For information to be processed, it must first be stored in the brain. There are various types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. When information is first stored, it's encoded in a specific way, depending on the type of sensory input. For instance, verbal input can be encoded based on its appearance, sound, or meaning.\n\nOnce information is stored, it must be maintained. Research suggests that working memory, which stores information for about 20 seconds, relies on an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period. Long-term memory, on the other hand, is thought to be maintained through the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are numerous models of how knowledge is organized in the brain, ranging from how humans retrieve memories to computer science and neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that there are nodes representing concepts, linked based on their relatedness. For example, in this model, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley paints a chilling picture of a dystopian world in his novel Brave New World, where technology and capitalism are intertwined to create a society where the individual is subjugated to the collective. The people of this world value community above all else, and from a very young age, they're conditioned to prioritize instant gratification. The citizens of this world are mere pawns in a grand game, forced to adhere to a single ideology dictated by the World Controller. Examining Huxley's work through the lens of Marxist theory reveals a deep-seated distrust of the systems he saw emerging around him. Key Marxist concepts like homogeny and reification abound, solidifying the notion that Brave New World is a scathing critique of the economic system of his time.\n\nThe capitalist machinery is cleverly satirized by Huxley through the concept of false consciousness. The average citizen is oblivious to the true nature of their economic relationships with other classes, consumed instead by their own self-interest. This is achieved through the ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, a phenomenon that's starkly evident in the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The lower classes, categorized as Deltas and Gammas, lack any genuine sense of self-determination; hypnopædia is used to fuel their desire to consume and indulge above all else. This manipulation is orchestrated by the World Controller, demonstrating the grip of hegemony – the idea that dominant social groups control and dominate others.\n\nThe lower classes are unwittingly complicit in this system, mindlessly buying into an ideology that sustains it. Meanwhile, the upper classes, like the Alphas and Betas, are cognizant of the manipulation but choose to do nothing, perpetuating the status quo. The interactions between characters in Brave New World are superficial, devoid of genuine relationships and depth. Huxley may be suggesting that the union of technology and capitalism extinguishes humanity's capacity for free will and self-expression. The absence of true love and deep emotions is evident in the shallow conversations between characters, often revolving around physical appearance and surface-level interactions. The complacency of each social class within their designated hierarchy is a telling indicator of the insidious effects of capitalism on the proletariat, as they're led to believe their superiority is tied to their ability to conform and consume.",
            "I've been a student here at University Park for nearly three years now - roughly four and a half semesters. As a student, I'm not alone in my struggles to navigate this sprawling campus. My freshman year, I was stuck in an East Halls dorm room, on the far eastern edge of campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in buildings like Willard, which are centrally located, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially when the weather turns gloomy, which it often does in State College.  I had a chance conversation with an alum not much older than me, and it turned out that not so long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the campus by massive empty tracts of land. Fast forward to today, and that vacant space has been filled in with sports fields, brand-new buildings, and a series of apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another is becoming increasingly difficult. So, what's the solution to this mobility conundrum? On a college campus, the answer is clear: the humble bicycle. But having a bike is just the starting point. Students need to ride them regularly, and the campus needs to be designed with cyclists in mind.\n\nI recently caught up with a friend who's recently dusted off his bike after a few years away from cycling. He mused to me, \"Bikes are great - for a few years it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Not only is cycling good for your physical health, it's also the most efficient mode of transportation. With a bowl of oatmeal and some physical exertion, you can cover 30 miles or more. As an off-campus resident, just like many of my peers, I've made the smart decision to buy a bike this year. With classes in Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my home, I can significantly cut down that time to just 5 minutes if I pedal hard enough. The only catch is, Pollock Road is the most direct route to Thomas building from my house, but it's not always easy to navigate, bike or otherwise. I'm not a fan of walking, so having a bike has been a lifesaver. If I didn't have my trusty bike, I'd have to rely on walking, which would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That's over two and a half hours every week. When you factor in the time I'd need to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and so on, it's a staggering amount of time I just can't spare."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the course of my academic journey, I've come to realize that a career in social work is where my passions and values align. I'm drawn to the Division of Family and Children Services, where I can make a meaningful difference in the lives of kids who've been mistreated or neglected, and support families in turmoil. My personal values – service, respect, integrity, and a commitment to self-improvement – aren't just ideals for social workers; they're fundamental principles that guide me every day. For instance, I believe in serving others without expectation of reward, respecting the dignity of every individual, and upholding the highest standards of ethics. I'm also committed to helping people build stronger relationships and continually honing my skills to stay adaptable and effective in my role.\n\nWhile I've always wanted to make a positive impact, I wasn't sure how to channel my energy. Throughout high school and college, I watched as people around me struggled to cope with challenges in unhealthy ways. That's why I pursued a degree in Psychology, hoping to understand the complexities of human behavior. Although I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009, I still felt uncertain about my career path. Everything changed when I visited a friend who was hosting a vulnerable teenager seeking refuge from an abusive home life. The following day, I learned he'd called the authorities to intervene. To see if I could help, I went to his parents' house, where I discreetly shared my concerns with the police and mentioned my recent Psychology degree. They asked me to speak with the parents, as there wasn't much they could do. When I confronted them about their behavior, they seemed evasive and made excuses for their son's actions. That experience made me realize the need for social workers who can help families navigate conflicts and provide support.\n\nAnother essential aspect of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim to value individuality, but our actions often suggest otherwise. We idealize conformity and criticize those who break the mold. I've never been one to shy away from challenging these norms. Throughout my time in high school and college, I expressed my individuality through my appearance, hobbies, and activism. I've worn my hair in bold colors, pierced my ears in unconventional ways, and spoken out against racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it. I believe in fighting for social justice and will continue to do so in my career as a social worker.",
            "Sleepless nights can be a real puzzle, and the age-old question of why we can't seem to catch a wink has been a topic of interest for years. This paper dives into the two primary models that attempt to explain insomnia: the biological and sociocultural models. The biological model zeroes in on the genetic information we inherit, as well as the medical aspects of our overall health. On the other hand, the sociocultural model explores how environmental factors, like our cultural background, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status, contribute to our sleep patterns. By examining various studies related to these models, we aim to gain a better understanding of the intricate relationships between genetics, environment, and sleep.\n\nInsomnia can manifest in different ways - as a standalone disorder, linked to another mental health condition, or caused by external factors like medical complications or substance intake. The primary sleep disorders fall under two categories: Dyssonias and Parasomnias. Dyssonias, which include Primary Insomnia and Narcolepsy, primarily affect the ability to fall asleep or stay asleep. Parasomnias, such as Nightmare Disorder and Sleep Terror Disorder, are characterized by abnormal behaviors and physiological occurrences during sleep. Our focus lies in understanding the biological and sociocultural factors that contribute to insomnia, a sleep disorder that can significantly impact daily life.\n\nFrom a biological perspective, research suggests that our genes play a significant role in regulating our sleep-wake cycles. A study on mice discovered that neurons in the hypothalamus, containing orexin, are responsible for controlling our sleep patterns. The activation of the GABAB receptor, found on these neurons, promotes sleep, while its inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and improved sleep quality. A study using the GABAB agonist (baclofen) showed an increase in sleep time in mice, indicating a potential genetic basis for sleep regulation in humans. This finding implies that an alteration in the GABAB receptor could lead to sleep disturbances, negatively impacting daily life and tasks that require focus and attention.\n\nThe sociocultural implications of this study are profound. If the GABAB receptor is inherited, it could regulate sleep patterns, and any alteration to this receptor could naturally disrupt sleep, affecting various aspects of life. This highlights the complex interplay between genetics, environment, and sleep, suggesting that a deeper understanding of these factors is crucial in addressing insomnia.",
            "I still recall the first time I delved into the complex world of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD). It's a disorder where the central nervous system, the brain, has trouble processing auditory information, leaving individuals with normal hearing unable to properly decipher sounds, differentiate conversations from background noise, or separate words. The disorder's history dates back to the 1950s when researchers began identifying it as \"auditory imperception\" while studying children with communicative disorders.\n\nAs I continued to learn about CAPD, I discovered that it's a multifaceted condition, manifesting in various ways. Some individuals may struggle to localize sounds, differentiate between multiple acoustic events, or recognize sound patterns. Others may have difficulty detecting changes in speech, such as sarcasm, or interpreting sound clues. The disorder can also make it challenging for individuals to determine the sequence of auditory information presented to them.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD requires a systematic evaluation of listening behavior and performance on tests of auditory function. This may involve various professionals, including audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists, using a range of measures to assess auditory-related skills. No single tool or test has been proven to be consistently effective in diagnosing CAPD, and the underlying cause remains unknown. Tests may present individuals with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and ask them to differentiate certain items, such as words or numbers. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring responses to these signals.\n\nAs a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom, helping a student with CAPD requires a thoughtful and supportive approach. By understanding the disorder and its effects, educators can create a more inclusive and supportive environment for students with CAPD. This includes adapting teaching methods, providing additional support, and being patient with students who may struggle to process auditory information.",
            "We see in Twelfth Night that a disguise, though useful for pulling off an elaborate deception, ultimately forces the wearer to confront the consequences of their actions. Rejection of the disguise is inevitable, but this can lead to feelings of isolation, as one risks losing touch with their true self in the process. The trouble lies in deciding between preserving one's own identity and maintaining relationships with those around them. While some may take a deception lightly, others may be deeply offended by it, highlighting a delicate balance between self-preservation and connection with others.\n\nThe topic of deception in Twelfth Night, specifically through the lens of gender role reversal, raises more questions than answers. Why do characters like Viola feel the need to adopt a disguise, and what lies beneath this desire? For Viola, disguising herself as a man is a means of self-protection, as evidenced by her lines \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count.\" (5.1.247-249) Her plan succeeds, but it also cuts her off from the support of other women, leaving her isolated and struggling to navigate her suppressed emotions.\n\nAs a foreigner in a new land, Viola's disguise makes her so convincing that Olivia falls in love with her, mistaking her for her twin brother Sebastian. Meanwhile, Viola must also contend with her own unrequited love for Orsino, who seems to hold a deep affection for her as Cesario. This may seem progressive to modern readers, but Twelfth Night can also be seen as a exploration of how deception can reveal hidden desires, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages suggest that their attraction to Cesario may be a manifestation of unexpressed emotions, but it's also possible that Olivia's affection is a satirical commentary on the superficiality of her time, as she quickly switches her affections to Sebastian and regards Cesario/Viola as a sister rather than a love interest, as seen in her line \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315)",
            "The brutal nature of German colonial rule has been well-documented, with numerous observers highlighting the devastating impact on the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, the German colonial empire was a complex entity, with a diverse array of policies, styles, and geographies. Educational provision across its territories was similarly varied. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a surprisingly well-educated and literate African population. German efforts in Kamerun and other colonies had also been praised by contemporary authors, who acknowledged their successes in promoting education.\n\nBut South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast. Unlike East Africa, where the government invested heavily in state schools and education for locals, in South West Africa, the task of educating the native population fell largely to underfunded missionary societies. The government did, however, devote significant resources to educating Europeans, establishing state schools and closely regulating missionary institutions. This educational divide had long-lasting effects on South West Africa, even after German rule had ended. Other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, whereas in South West Africa, the vast majority of the population remained uneducated and illiterate.\n\nA multitude of social, political, and economic factors contributed to the divergent experience of South West Africa. To shed more light on this phenomenon, this paper aims to delve deeper into the underlying causes and scrutinize new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThe scholarly literature on German colonial education is vast, with many sources written in German during the early twentieth century. These early works focused on describing the features of educational systems in the colonies. Later studies, written in English, broadened the discussion by comparing education in different German colonies and providing in-depth analyses of specific aspects of education. Notably, Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa stands out for its comprehensive comparison of the two colonies and its identification of the key factors that drove their educational differences. According to Cohen, the presence of a large settler population in South West Africa was a major contributor to the colony's unique educational system.\n\nCompared to other German colonies, South West Africa had a relatively temperate climate, with arid desert regions making up a significant portion of the territory. This relatively hospitable environment drew a substantial European population to the area, with nearly 15,000 whites living in South West Africa by 1913. In contrast, East Africa, with its smaller settler population, had fewer than 5,400 European residents at the same time.",
            "The class of Popular Music has ballooned over the past 100 years, now boasting an impossibly long list of genres that seems impossible to catalogue. And if that weren't enough, many of these genres - rock, country, jazz, folk, and more - have spawned a dizzying array of sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, each branching off from the last. One genre that has arguably become the most adventurous and expressive of all is Heavy Metal, which has been expressing a wide range of emotions over the past 40 years, albeit with a clear lean towards the darker side of the emotional spectrum.\n\nHeavy Metal's flexibility has allowed it to incorporate diverse styles and themes from other genres, and people have jumped at the chance to create their own sub-genres, which in turn gave birth to even more sub-sub-genres. Fast-forward to today, and the Heavy Metal movement is so fragmented that it's hard to pin down exactly what Heavy Metal even is. To truly understand the dizzying array of metal music out there, you need to grasp what the metal movement is all about, and why it's so much more than just a genre.\n\nAt its core, Metal is a movement defined by its darkness, a music of excess - more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatrics. And yet, it's also a movement where musicians are all about showcasing their chops, pushing the limits of what's possible on their instruments. Metal's also inextricably linked to the world of psychedelics, with the mid-70s counterculture inspiring musicians to create music that was truly otherworldly. The result was a sound that was both visceral and deeply unsettling, a departure from the more upbeat, feel-good music that dominated the airwaves. Later generations of metal musicians drew inspiration from this darker, more primal energy, infusing it with the Gothic Romanticism of the era.\n\nLyrics like those found in Helter Skelter, a song often cited as one of the first Heavy Metal tracks, showcase the movement's penchant for the dark and the visceral. Written by the Beatles in response to the Rolling Stones' own darker offerings, Helter Skelter is a testament to the pioneering spirit of Heavy Metal, a genre that continues to evolve and branch out in all directions.",
            "It's only fitting that Henri Rousseau, the pioneering Post-Impressionist artist, should have been crafting his own dreamlike works years before the Surrealist movement even took off. His captivating 1910 painting, The Dream, not only depicts a woman marveling at the wonders of a fantastical land, but it's also a deeply personal reflection of Rousseau's own aspirations as an artist. Since embarking on his artistic journey, Rousseau had been driven by a burning desire for recognition, acceptance, and praise from his peers – a goal that ultimately led him to confront a daunting internal struggle. As he navigated his career, he found himself torn between conforming to established styles to gain acceptance from the art world he idolized, or forging his own path and embracing his unique voice.\n\nTo truly appreciate The Dream in this context, it's essential to delve into Rousseau's remarkable backstory. Born on May 21, 1844, in the charming town of Laval, northwest France, Henri Rousseau came from a relatively comfortable middle-class family, with his father working as a tinsmith and hardware dealer. Despite his comfortable upbringing, Rousseau never received formal art training, instead choosing to pursue a career in the municipal toll service, where he worked as a gabelou until the age of forty. The sobriquet 'douanier' – customs inspector – only added to his humble beginnings. The loss of his first wife, Clémence, and eight infant children left Rousseau heartbroken, and it was during this tumultuous time that he turned to painting as a source of comfort and rebirth. Unlike his contemporaries, who often romanticized the peasant class, Rousseau's folk art reflected the hopes and dreams of the common man.\n\nGiven his circumstances, Rousseau's quest for acceptance from the art world is more than understandable. As an uneducated artist who began his career at an older age, he was competing with some of the most talented and renowned modern artists of his time. It wasn't until around the same period that Matisse was establishing himself as an artist that Rousseau finally gained recognition. In her book Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon astutely observes that while both artists vied for recognition in the art world, their motivations and styles were vastly different: \"Matisse was driven by a fear of painting blandly, while Rousseau yearned to create something so conventional that he'd be welcomed into the Artiste Français.\"",
            "For centuries, philosophers have pondered an intriguing connection between ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. I firmly believe that at a fundamental level, there's a profound reason for this connection. As John Keats so eloquently puts it in his poem \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Our understanding of the world is largely shaped by education and experience, yet our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics seems to transcend these conventional paths of learning. Both ethics and aesthetics are more about describing the essence of something, rather than providing a set of strict guidelines.\n\nIn essence, our studies of morality and beauty are attempts to unpack why a piece of art or literature resonates with us, rather than a set of rigid rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior. Criticism of art or morals can never fully capture the essence of what makes something beautiful or right. Think of the countless debates about the Mona Lisa – they might revolve around concepts like composition, context, or cultural significance, but ultimately, these explanations fall short of describing why it's a masterpiece. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, we often hear a phrase like \"There's just something about it\" preceding a more in-depth analysis. I believe that both art and morals can never be reduced to a mere description of their qualities. As the brilliant Flannery O'Connor so astutely put it, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Similarly, ethics has this same elusive quality, as Ludwig Wittgenstein so eloquently stated, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\"\n\nI propose that it's this \"something\" – this je ne sais quoi – that is the most powerful attribute of both art and morality. This transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a common ground between them. I believe that morality and art are closely related because we experience both of them most profoundly at a level that can be felt, but not fully explained. This connection is especially strong when it comes to literature, as McKean so aptly observed, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany is a force to be reckoned with today - a unified country with a rich cultural tapestry woven from the threads of its alpine roots in München to the Baltic coast in Kiel.  This distinct cultural identity can be felt from the Rhine river town of Köln all the way to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. Given its unique cultural heritage, it's hardly surprising that modern Germany has its roots in the confluence of various tribes and influences. \n\nGermania, the ancestral homeland of the Germans, has a name shrouded in mystery. Scholars and historians are still debating its origins, with some pointing to a Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, whom Tacitus believed were previously known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and clashed with the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98). Others argue that Julius Caesar first coined the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, distinguishing between the Gauls he had conquered and the Germanic tribes he had yet to defeat. According to Caesar, the Gauls themselves used the term to refer to their neighbors, which he later adopted to describe the warring tribes beyond the Rhine (Caesar, 50-40 BC). Whether the term originated from the Gaulish language or derived from the spear used in warfare, known as a ger, or even the Old Irish word garim meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans were a vocal people, remains unclear. \n\nTacitus, an early Roman historian, penned his thoughts on the origins of the Germans in his 98 AD writing \"De Origine et situ Germanorum.\" In it, he described the Germans as an indigenous people, untouched by outside influences through immigration or trade. He quipped that who would choose to leave the warmth of Italy for the harsh climate and rugged landscape of Germany, unless it was their homeland? (Tacitus, 98) It's little wonder that the Romans, though they did launch conquests into Germania, rarely settled there, preferring to return to their sprawling empire. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the 1st century, they resided on the fringes of the Roman Empire, trading goods and skills acquired from their homeland for Roman patronage and military service (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).",
            "As I stood there, my mind was a blank slate, taking in the scene in front of me without any emotional response. It was as if I'd been trained to observe, but my brain refused to connect the dots, keeping my thoughts separate from any deeper understanding. My consciousness was in a state of pure observation, like a camera capturing the moment without interpretation. Thoughts flashed in and out of my mind, too fast to grasp, leaving my mental state eerily clear and uncluttered.\n\nI'd picked up 'The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain' on the advice of an artist I'd worked with, hoping to finally learn how to draw. That book explained the basics of art and how the brain processes lines, from understanding the tool to interpreting vision. One technique it taught was to surround a picture with a square frame, simplifying a complex scene into a manageable composition. At that moment, I stared at the unremarkable bowl of fruit in front of me, but my mind was too overwhelmed to apply that technique. I was frozen, mesmerized by the intricate details of the scene, unable to mentally impose the artist's frame.\n\nAs an aspiring artist, I felt like I was on the cusp of creating something special, like the start of my masterpiece, 'Work in Brown.' My hand instinctively reached for my drawing tool, my muscles tensing and relaxing as I prepared to bring my vision to life. But instead, my fingers landed on the toilet handle, and I was faced with an unwelcome reality. A stubborn brown package clung to the bottom of the toilet, defying my efforts to move it.\n\nHolding the mop loosely, I stood there, my green tie knotted uncomfortably around my neck, staring at the unpleasant surprise left for the janitorial staff at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more moments of introspection, and my hand moved towards the wall, gripped the toilet paper roll, and began wrapping itself in a makeshift mitten. I straightened up, bent down, and slowly inserted my hand into the bowl, like a parent checking the Thanksgiving turkey in the oven.",
            "Behind the wheel, a ticking time bomb. The alarming statistics of teenager fatalities have raised red flags, and it's not hard to see why. The National Institutes of Health shed light on a crucial aspect of the problem: the teen brain is still developing, making it ill-equipped to handle the risks of driving. Add to this inexperience, and you've got a deadly combination. The simple fact is, inexperienced teens are not only more likely to be involved in fatal accidents but also to be involved in rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road.\n\nAnd let's not forget the company they keep: teens are far more likely to be involved in accidents when they're driving with their friends. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that revealed a sobering correlation between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents. California and other states have introduced provisional licenses to limit the hours teens can drive and restrict passengers under a certain age, but I'm not convinced these measures go far enough.\n\nIn my opinion, the real issue lies in the fact that, as a group, the youngest drivers are statistically unable to handle the risks and responsibilities of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman's research suggests that even 18-year-olds are too young to handle the wheel, citing a common desire among young people to take risks for the thrill of it. It makes sense to delay driving until this tendency to thrill-seek has subsided. If we continue to issue licenses to young teens, we can expect the death toll to skyrocket – and by 2010, the Baby Boomers' offspring will be hitting the roads in droves, further exacerbating the problem.\n\nLegislation to address this issue wouldn't be complicated. Schools could continue to provide driver's education classes, but no one under 18 should be allowed to get behind the wheel. Provisional permits could still be issued, but only after a certain number of hours of practical training – say, the 6 hours and 50 hours of practice with an adult that California currently requires. Uniform national legislation would be a reasonable and effective way to protect teens across the country. And let's be clear: this idea is not new – it's a common-sense approach to a very real problem.",
            "Diving into the Library of Congress's vast collection of early Edison films, I decided to immerse myself in the realm of trick films, a total of fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These early masterpieces rely on creative editing to create illusions, and my film analysis focused on unraveling the poetic underpinnings of the majority of trick films and identifying the evolutionary outliers present in a few of the later ones. The trick films from this era generally adhere to a set of conventions: they're often set-bound, confined within a frontal proscenium, feature static camera angles, and stick to the one shot per film rule. However, a few daring early 20th-century films boldly break free from these rules, introducing innovative techniques like multiple shots.\n\nOne of the most striking features shared by these trick films is their rigid adherence to the frontal proscenium composition. The camera remains stationary, never deviating from its fixed position to follow characters or objects within the frame. This composition is a nod to the theatre and vaudeville traditions, which trick films drew inspiration from, particularly magic acts. The use of a stage as a setting inevitably restricts character movement to side-to-side, rather than forward or backward, as seen in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right and move along the horizontal axis, with the camera remaining steadfast, even as they exit the frame.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style also dictates that shots tend to be long and, occasionally, medium shots. Close-ups are a rarity in these early trick films, as they borrowed from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would witness the entire performance, framed by the borders of the stage. The actors generally remain grounded, never venturing towards the camera, thus rendering close-ups impossible.\n\nMost trick films adhere to the principle that one conceptual shot equals a film, limiting their length to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. This constraint restricts the narrative or dramatic scope of the trick films, which often focus on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearance, and switching acts, with minimal storytelling. However, as revealed in a closer examination of The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a single conceptual shot can be composed of multiple physical shots, expertly joined to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance.",
            "I've always been intrigued by John Taylor of Caroline, a true champion of Republicanism in the early days. As an agriculturalist and politician, he was known for his unwavering dedication to the cause of personal freedom and limited government. His passion for the agrarian way of life was at the heart of his views on governance, shaping his opinions on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the judicial system.\n\nTaylor believed that the United States had a unique opportunity to create a utopian system of government, untainted by traditional influences. This allowed him to envision a self-governing society where the natural rights of individuals were protected and respected. He firmly believed that these rights were interconnected and that denying one would undermine the value of all. These rights should, in his opinion, be beyond the reach of the government.\n\nTaylor argued that the concept of the \"state of nature\" suggested that those with physical strength and malicious intentions were often the ones who profited, but he believed this shouldn't be the case in a civilized society. To create an ideal society, he advocated for a government that acknowledged both the good and evil inherent in humanity. Taylor was unyielding in his conviction that a dualistic morality was essential, stating that governments, as they are shaped by human nature, would inevitably reflect both virtues and vices.\n\nAccording to Taylor, good principles were those that safeguarded private property, promoted agriculture, and discouraged capitalism. He believed a government founded on these principles would function fairly, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by self-interest. While self-interest was a fundamental human motivation, Taylor saw it as a problem only when it led to the creation of sub-societies that exploited others.\n\nA good government, in Taylor's view, was necessary to contain humanity's natural evil, and it must be closely monitored to prevent the introduction of corrupt principles. Like many fellow Republicans of his time, Taylor advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution, with a limited Federal government that only possessed the powers explicitly outlined in the document. He recognized that an expansive government would be costly and potentially tyrannical, but he also believed that a literal interpretation without consideration of the writers' intent could lead to corruption. Furthermore, Taylor considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it more explicitly described the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Going back to the data in Figure 17, we noticed a drastic decline in commuter log submissions during the third month of our project. It was a bit disheartening, and we couldn't quite put our finger on why this was happening. One factor that might have contributed to the decrease was the onset of winter at our New England campus, which tends to decrease the number of people commuting by bike or on foot. Additionally, December is a hectic time for students, with finals and grades to finish, making it easy for the commuter log to fall by the wayside. To make matters worse, December marks the start of the holiday season and a month-long break for students and faculty, leaving many without a reason to come to campus. Classes resumed in late January, but this didn't seem to translate into a significant increase in log submissions. We couldn't help but wonder if our project's initial excitement and momentum had naturally waned, much like a burst of energy that eventually fizzles out. To combat this trend, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a high-energy campaign that actually led to a spike in log submissions that month. However, we still struggled with maintaining project momentum in the face of the inevitable dip in engagement caused by semester breaks and holidays.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges we faced was the fact that people in our culture tend to love the independence and freedom that comes with driving their cars. To incentivize alternative modes of commuting, we offered a range of prizes, including gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, and bookstores. It would have been interesting to see how bigger prizes might have affected participation – perhaps a shiny new bike, a hybrid car, or an electric vehicle would have really gotten people excited and engaged. We stuck with the same prizes throughout the project, but if we had introduced more substantial rewards over time, we might have seen a different outcome. For instance, if we had announced a bicycle giveaway in December and a hybrid car in January, we could have potentially turned the trend around and seen an increase in participation instead of a decline.",
            "Imagine being able to invest in a security that combines the benefits of an index fund with the flexibility of a single stock, without the hefty price tag.  Enter the ETF, or exchange traded fund, a financial instrument designed to track a specific index, commodity, or basket of assets.  While it's true that ETFs offer diversification and the freedom to short sell, buy on margin, and even purchase a single share at a time - much like a traditional stock - they also come with a significantly lower expense ratio compared to the average mutual fund.  However, there are some trade-offs, such as the commission fees associated with buying and selling ETFs, just like stocks.\n\nOn the plus side, ETFs offer a dizzying array of investment options, giving investors a wide range to choose from.  But savvy investors know that it's essential to critically evaluate the benefits of any investment, including diversification, to ensure they truly deliver as promised.  In this analysis, we'll take a closer look at the ETF IHF and its top 10 holdings, which account for a staggering 63.58% of its total assets.  We'll examine whether investing in these top holdings can provide the same benefits as owning a diversified portfolio of the same stocks, and whether there are alternative configurations that could offer an even better return on investment.\n\nTo keep things manageable, we'll focus on the top 10 holdings, leaving out the smaller fish in the pond.  To get a better sense of how these stocks represent the ETF as a whole, we can use their current asset allocation to calculate their individual contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming a portfolio comprised solely of these 10 stocks in the same proportions as the ETF.  The results are enlightening, showing that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could deliver a whopping 16% higher return than the ETF, with a Beta that's a full 0.12 lower.\n\nBut can we be confident in these results?  To find out, we'll dive deeper by calculating the standard deviation of each top 10 stock and comparing it to the ETF's overall standard deviation.  Will our findings be statistically significant, or are they just a fluke?  Stay tuned to find out.",
            "I've often found myself pondering the literary works of Edgar Allan Poe, and 'Dream-Land' stands out as one of his notable poems. Poe himself considered it a personal standout. As I delved into the poem, I came across the term 'Thulé', which is repeated in lines 6 and 56. According to Thomas O. Mabbott, Poe drew inspiration from Virgil's use of the term to describe an island north of Britain, which the ancient Greeks believed marked the edge of the known world. However, there's another, more contemporary source that should be acknowledged - Poe's fascination with German authors.\n\nThis connection is significant because it highlights Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writing. In his book 'Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon', Karl J. Arndt points out the striking similarities between their poems, leading him to conclude that Poe was, in fact, drawing inspiration from Goethe. Interestingly, The Oxford Companion to English Literature notes that Goethe was a celebrated poet and playwright, best known for his masterpiece 'Faust', which was published in two parts - the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe's passing.\n\nWithin the second part of 'Faust' lies a haunting poem, 'The King of Thulé', which tells the tale of a king whose wife passes away after gifting him a goblet. Consumed by grief, the king becomes a heavy drinker and eventually decides to join his beloved queen in death. He leaves his possessions to his children, keeps the goblet as a reminder of his loss, and then takes his own life. The parallels between the King of Thulé and the protagonist of 'Dream-Land' are striking, almost as if Poe was drawing inspiration from Goethe's poem as a way to cope with his own loss and reliance on drink.\n\nIt's worth noting that Goethe's 'Faust' was adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe used the term 'Thule' in 'The Pit and the Pendulum'. Poe referenced Thule twice in his collected works, using 'ultima Thule' in 'The Pit and the Pendulum' and 'Dream-Land' as a repeated refrain. 'The King of Thulé' and 'Dream-Land' can be seen as companion pieces, with Goethe's poem serving as a precursor to Poe's exploration of themes such as loss, loneliness, and a world devoid of color.\n\nGiven Poe's admiration for Tennyson, it's likely that he was familiar with Goethe's work, even if only through reproductions of his writings that were widely available after the original publication. As I see it, Goethe's influence on Poe's poetry is undeniable, a testament to the power of literary connections that transcend time and geography.",
            "Under California law, a customer who slipped and fell on a puddle of applesauce in a grocery store could potentially be awarded punitive damages if they could show that the store manager acted with malice by ignoring a spill, even after being informed twice about it, because he was too busy eating dinner. But would a judge summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages?\n\nUnlikely. To win a punitive damage claim, Palmer would need to provide evidence that the store manager's actions demonstrated a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result, as well as a level of despicability. However, Palmer's case might hold up because she could argue that store manager Paul Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning the spill, given that multiple customers had slipped in similar incidents in the months leading up to her accident, and yet he still chose to do nothing.\n\nPalmer's argument that Martin's actions were despicable is not a slam dunk, but it's not entirely implausible either, especially considering that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred at the store in 2009, and Martin still failed to take adequate measures to ensure customer safety. A lower court decision from 1979, Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., suggests that conduct can be considered malicious if the defendant was aware of the probable consequences of their actions and willfully chose to ignore them.\n\nLet's look at the facts: on October 13, 2009, at 5 pm, an employee, Rick Wayne, informed Martin about the applesauce spill, but Martin claimed he was on dinner break and couldn't deal with it. An hour later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin about the spill, and he responded with the same excuse. It wasn't until 5:30 pm that the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Before her accident, there had been five similar slip-and-fall incidents at the store that year, and Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages. We're considering whether to file a motion to dismiss the punitive damage claim, but based on the facts, it's unlikely that a judge would do so without further review.",
            "It's been almost four years since I took a course in Islam at CBC, and the discussions we had in class still linger in my mind. The question of whether Islam is a hostile religion was a recurring theme. I believe this question has become increasingly relevant over the years, particularly in light of the events since 9/11. It's astonishing to see how the media's perception of Islam has shifted from being hostile to extremely tolerant in America. In 2001, it would have been unthinkable for a presidential candidate with a Muslim background, such as Barack Obama, to run for office.\n\nThe Biography of the Prophet has left me intrigued, as the account of Muhammad's life contradicts my initial understanding of his character. According to the biography, Muhammad is portrayed as a martyr who was often misunderstood and humble, rather than the conqueror I had previously thought. Instead of forcing conversions, people were drawn to his teachings, one by one. This characterization has led me to question the author's intentions, as it seems they're trying to present Muhammad as a gentle and endearing figure.\n\nI've noticed uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' attributed to Muhammad. The most striking example is the story of multiplying food for forty men, which is eerily reminiscent of Jesus' own miracles. This style of writing makes me wonder if the authors are downplaying the true miracle and significance of Jesus' life, essentially borrowing from his story to create a more palatable image of Muhammad.\n\nFurthermore, the biography often presents stories that seem designed to showcase 'witnesses' and conversions to Islam, but these accounts are often third-hand, based on hearsay and unverifiable testimonies. This approach diminishes the credibility of the stories and raises suspicions in my mind.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this work is the attempt to elevate Muhammad to a godly figure, portraying him as humble, wise, and gentle. However, historical records paint a different picture of Muhammad's rise to power, and I can't help but wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true complexities behind his story.",
            "It's striking how quickly the teachings of Jesus were lost in the shuffle as Christianity evolved after his lifetime. Looking back, we can see a clear pattern of Christianity drifting further and further away from its roots. Fast forward to today, and it's clear that there's an increasing awareness and a progressive shift underway. While traditionalists are holding tight to what they've been taught, their numbers might not be enough to sway the masses. In the years to come, Christians will increasingly become aware of the historical context of their faith, and a growing desire to strip away the excesses added to Christianity over time will emerge. It will take time – maybe decades or even centuries – but ultimately, the trend of Christian history will reverse itself. As the clock turns back, people will begin to peel away the layers of doctrine that have accumulated, leaving behind a more authentic representation of the message Jesus brought to humanity on behalf of God. When this shift gains momentum, it will sweep through the United States and Europe, influencing countless people to follow the original teachings of Jesus, unencumbered by centuries of added dogma. The church as an institution will continue to thrive, but its influence will be tempered by a renewed focus on the simplicity and unity of Jesus' message. Instead of the current diversity and fragmentation, we can expect to see more uniformity in Christian thought and practice across different regions, denominations, and divisions. History is full of examples of such reversals – think of how the Roman Empire once persecuted Christians, only to eventually adopt the faith. Similarly, our country has come a long way from slavery to equality. The great reversal that's on the horizon will be a fundamental shift in the Christian faith, one that will take us back to the source and, in the process, simplify and unify the faith. A key factor in this process will be a renewed appreciation for the metaphorical nature of Jesus' words, rather than taking them at face value. So, what happened to the original message of Jesus? By looking back to the early days before Jesus, we find that Judaism was the foundation of the Christian faith. The core components of monotheism, divinely revealed religion, and the authority of Hebrew scripture were already in place by the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. But within Judaism, there was no single, unified spirit – the community was divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a broader group of ordinary Jews.",
            "I believe that The Jungle exposes the harsh reality of human nature, revealing our innate tendency towards self-interest and greed. At our core, we're all about looking out for number one and making our lives as comfortable as possible, without much concern for those beneath us. The Jungle masterfully portrays this through various aspects of the story. The factory owners and managers are prime examples of this self-centeredness. Their sole focus is on expanding their businesses and increasing their wealth, no matter the cost. They show little regard for anything that stands in their way or suffers as a result of their actions. Upton Sinclair's vivid descriptions, such as \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world,\" paint a stark picture of the devastating impact of pollution on the environment. Sinclair highlights the owners' disregard for the well-being of people and animals caught in the crossfire of their pursuit of progress.\n\nThe owners and managers also demonstrate a callous disregard for their employees, who toil tirelessly to fuel their wealth. They're willing to do whatever it takes to save a buck, as Sinclair so poignantly puts it: \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They exploit their workers, forcing them to work grueling hours without notice, and then discard them like so much trash when they're no longer needed. In the era depicted in The Jungle, the lack of laws and regulations protecting workers' rights allowed the owners and managers to run amok, forcing their employees to sacrifice their well-being for the sake of progress. The book implies that those who toiled and died in Packingtown were expected to endure the deplorable conditions, both on the job and in their living environments, without any support or recourse. The absence of organizations or agencies to advocate for workers' welfare only exacerbated the situation, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation. Unions, which were supposed to be a beacon of hope, often proved to be a disappointment, preying on the very people they were supposed to protect. The workers were effectively trapped in a system akin to slavery, with immorality and desperation becoming an inevitable consequence, as Sinclair so starkly puts it: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers.\"",
            "When authors attempt to convey their thoughts and opinions to readers, they often resort to a variety of techniques to achieve the desired effect. Some of these methods are more effective than others, and F. Scott Fitzgerald is a master of using them in his writing. In his iconic novel, The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald employs several of these techniques to shape readers' perceptions of significant themes and characters. One of these techniques is pairing an adjective with a noun in a way that defies convention, evoking a specific atmosphere around a subject. Another approach is assigning meaning to a symbol and then leveraging it to convey a particular emotion or idea. Fitzgerald's use of colors is a prime example of this latter technique, with gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink playing key roles in the novel.\n\nFitzgerald skillfully builds up meaning for the colors white/gray, which he later uses to evoke a sense of uniformity, class, and age in important scenes. At the beginning of the novel, we see the author consistently using both colors to set the tone. For instance, Daisy and Jordan are frequently described as being \"in white,\" and the list of white-clad characters is extensive - Nick dons \"white flannels\" at Gatsby's party, Tom sports a \"white shirt\" when meeting Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white.\" Even everyday objects and settings take on a uniform hue, such as the \"white chasms of lower New York\" Nick navigates on his way to work and the \"gray names\" on his party guest list. This widespread use of white and gray helps to create a sense of monotony and class distinction.\n\nHowever, as the novel progresses, Fitzgerald uses these colors to signify the unimportance or uniformity of certain characters and themes. This shift begins with Daisy, who, after a lull in her appearances, is reintroduced as \"dressed in white\" in a \"little white roadster.\" This portrayal reinforces the notion that Daisy has become a uniform, unremarkable figure in Gatsby's life, rather than a fully fleshed-out character. The use of a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" and her subsequent appearances in a \"white\" dress serve to further underscore this impression, making the reader see her as a mere accessory to Gatsby's desires rather than a fully realized individual.",
            "San Diego County is a gardener's paradise, where the sun shines bright and the harvest is bountiful. The region is home to a wide variety of crops, including the sweet taste of fresh tomatoes, juicy citrus fruits, crisp leafy greens, and an array of squash and broccoli varieties. Herbs, tree fruits, and berries are also in abundance, as well as the golden nectar of honey and the spicy kick of peppers. It's no wonder that the demand for organic community-supported agriculture is high in the area, with many local organizations struggling to keep up with lengthy waiting lists for their fresh produce. Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand, and some farms even offer tours of their operations, allowing visitors to hike, birdwatch, and connect with nature.\n\nThe benefits of organic farming are numerous, but it's not without its challenges. Without relying on chemicals, organic farms require more labor and management to keep pests and weeds under control and the soil fertile. This can lead to higher costs and greater losses, especially for small-scale operations that can't match the efficiency of larger conventional farms. However, the payoff is well worth it, as organic farming promotes biodiversity and creates a healthier environment for both plants and wildlife.\n\nFor a small landowner in the San Diego area, the goal is to find a balance between profitability and environmental sustainability. A 160-acre parcel of land adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California, offers a prime opportunity to do just that. The property features a mix of chaparral, non-native grassland, and oak woodland, and is surrounded by the Cleveland National Forest. The East County Southern Foothills ecoregion is home to over a hundred species of plants and animals, many of which are endangered or declining, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the California gnatcatcher.\n\nThis land has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries and later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. As part of an original homestead patent, the land was likely used for grazing and wood production for many years. Today, a small farmer might seek financial assistance and expertise to mitigate costs and preserve the property's wildlife-friendly operations. I chose a model farm in the same area to demonstrate the possibilities.",
            "In any negotiation, culture plays a pivotal role. But what is culture, really? It's not a fixed entity; it's a dynamic, multifaceted thing that reveals itself through what it encompasses, as much as what it excludes. It's far from homogenous or singular; rather, it's a rich tapestry of complexities and nuances. Reducing a culture to simplistic generalizations – \"Russians are stubborn\" or \"the Japanese are accommodating\" – is a gross oversimplification. While it's essential to grasp a culture's general essence, it's more productive for a negotiator to delve deeper, understanding how that culture's values and attitudes will shape the negotiation process. When we encounter a foreign culture, we inevitably draw comparisons to our own, and this can lead to misunderstandings.\n\nDelving into a culture involves immersing yourself in its history, its prejudices, and its idiosyncrasies. Rather than judging or trying to change it, a negotiator must accept it for what it is and work within its boundaries, especially when the stakes are high or the bargaining position is weak. When operating in unfamiliar territory, a genuine respect for a culture's traditions and values can be a game-changer, helping to bridge cultural divides and propel the negotiation forward.\n\nIt's also essential to recognize that culture isn't solely defined by national or international borders. Corporate culture, for instance, can be a distinct entity within a given nation. A company's emphasis on long work hours or a relaxed schedule, its dress code, communication style, and hiring practices can all reveal its unique culture. Even within the United States, corporate culture can vary significantly from company to company and within regions, highlighting the intricate diversity of thought within a societal culture. What appears uniform or monolithic on the surface can hide a complex web of values and attitudes waiting to be uncovered.\n\nUnderstanding values is crucial, as they provide the underlying motivations of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony is paramount, a negotiator will think twice before publicly embarrassing their company or superior. Conversely, in cultures where a hard-won bargain is prized, negotiators may resist settling for a compromise. By considering these cultural nuances ahead of time, a negotiator can navigate the negotiation table with greater finesse. However, to truly succeed, it's also essential to develop a personal connection with the opposing party, as this can make the negotiation more effective.",
            "We often hear the saying, 'There is no God,' but it's a notion also echoed by the likes of St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas, two thinkers who dedicated their work to proving the existence of a higher power. In this comparison, we'll assume both are correct in their belief in the Christian God, and focus on whose argument is more convincing. To ensure a fair comparison, let's start with the understanding that we're discussing their views on the Christian God specifically.\n\nLooking through the lens of their writings, it becomes apparent that neither St. Anselm nor Thomas Aquinas provides a comprehensive basis for faith. To illustrate this point, let's examine their arguments. St. Anselm's argument revolves around the idea that the existence of God is found within our own understanding, a notion he derived from faith. According to him, we can prove God's existence by looking within ourselves, believing that the concept of God is inherently known to be true. This idea is often referred to as faith, which, by definition, doesn't rely on empirical evidence. In essence, Anselm suggests that we don't need to look elsewhere for truth – it's within our own minds.\n\nIn stark contrast, Thomas Aquinas presents a more traditional and evidence-based approach. He argues that the existence of God can be proven through reason and empirical evidence alone, eliminating the need for faith. This would make it easier to convert new followers, as his arguments are based on logic rather than unproven assumptions. Aquinas lists five logical arguments in support of God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. His core idea is that the proof of God lies in the inherent logic that dictates the existence of a higher power.",
            "It's a story that spans over 2,500 years, one that begins in the ancient times of the 5th or 6th century BCE. A young prince, destined to be known as Buddha, was born, and his life would take a dramatic turn when he renounced the world to find enlightenment. His teachings would shape the foundation of Buddhism, the most traditional branch of which is Theravada Buddhism. Fast forward to the present, and it's clear that the religion has undergone a significant transformation over the centuries. This transformation is evident in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed, a tradition that has little to do with the teachings of Buddha. The fissures between the original teachings and the modern practices run deep, from the surface-level customs to the core principles of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, comprising both monks and lay individuals, has had to adapt its principles over time, influenced by both internal and external forces.\n\nAs we delve into the discussion, it's essential to grasp the nuances of the terms that will be used. An internal force refers to a change driven by the Buddhist community itself, whether monks or laypeople. External forces, on the other hand, originate from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that intentionally harm or seek to damage the community, often driven by a negative perception of Buddhism. Benign forces, while not necessarily beneficial, do not aim to harm and might even inadvertently contribute to the community's growth.\n\nTo gain a deeper understanding of Theravada Buddhism, let's start with the core principles. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma encompasses the Tripitaka, a collection of three baskets of sacred texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka explores the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism, including concepts like Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). By grasping these fundamental ideas, one can break free from Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, and ultimately overcome lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for laypeople, such as the five precepts (do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not engage in misconduct, and do not consume intoxicating substances). For monks, there are additional rules to follow. At the heart of Buddhism lies the four noble truths: Dukkha (life is suffering), attachment causes suffering, and suffering can be overcome.",
            "The long-standing feud between the United States and Mexico, a bitter rivalry that spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893, is a telling example of two nations that couldn't seem to see eye-to-eye. In fact, things came to a head during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, when the United States successfully invaded Mexico, securing Texas and the American Southwest as its new territory (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145). But this wasn't the only clash between the two nations; there were many more skirmishes and power struggles throughout their history, which finally started to subside just before World War I. \n\nWhat set off this rivalry was a clash of fundamental values and interests, particularly when it came to religion, culture, and tradition (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31). Sound familiar? It's a pattern that's repeated in many other nations that share a border with their neighbors. Where lines are drawn, interests collide, and rival positions emerge. The US and Mexico are not unique in this regard; David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that only a handful of nations, including Mexico and Cuba, have been able to sustain long-term diplomatic headaches for the United States (p. 41). Geography plays a significant role in these lasting rivalries, and the proximity of these nations to the US is no coincidence. \n\nOne major point of contention between the two nations was their differing views on religion, a source of discord that has plagued many nations throughout history. As Sally Frahm (2001) points out, in the 18th and 19th centuries, Americans were just as opposed to Catholicism and monarchies as they were to fascism and communism in the 20th century (p. 86). The ideological struggles between the US and Mexico were akin to the Cold War's East-West standoff, but with a twist - instead of a battle between politics, it was a clash of faiths. This underlying distrust was inherited from their former colonial rulers, the English and Spanish, making it a major hurdle to establishing a harmonious relationship between the two nations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) catalogued an astonishing 17 disputes between Mexico and the US during this 57-year period, with the majority of these conflicts centered around territorial issues and border raids from Mexican territory. The violence and lawlessness on both sides of the border were a persistent problem that wasn't fully resolved until both countries exerted military force to maintain order (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97).\n\nIt wasn't until Mexico became increasingly dependent on the US that the rivalry began to fade, and by the late 19th century, American ambitions had shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico, effectively ending the bitter rivalry (Schmitt, 1974, p. 109-110).",
            "It's been fifteen long years since I was unexpectedly laid low by a mysterious illness that I never saw coming. At the time, I was a nurse, having chosen that career path because it seemed like a safe and secure way to make a living. I'd often heard the same mantra growing up: \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\" While I had bigger dreams - I longed to be a scientist or a journalist - this was the path I took. \n\nNow, at 46 and single, with no savings to speak of, I've been living on disability benefits for over a decade. I'm still struggling to get by, with every passing day feeling like an exhausting battle for my security, safety, and self-worth. The thought of uncertainty looms over me, yet I'm reminded of a hard-won truth: without the unwavering support of my family and a few kind friends, I wouldn't have made it this far. When disaster strikes, it's easy to feel overwhelmed, and I know I'm not alone in that feeling.\n\nMy point is this: no matter how prepared you are, life's emergencies - big and small - are inevitable. There are no guarantees, and some challenges are just too great to face alone.\n\nWhile I agree that we should be cautious about relying too heavily on the government, I firmly believe that we'd be better off fostering a culture of mutual support and trust. Rather than each of us going it alone, we should be learning to rely on one another and ask for help when we need it.\n\nThe conservatives in the US often romanticize the idea of rugged individualism that supposedly built this country, but the truth is that our forebears relied on compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources to get through tough times. Those pioneers who trekked across the Rocky Mountains didn't make it to the coast without the help of their fellow travelers.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I've got my disaster kit, first aid supplies, and a stash of emergency supplies. If you have the means, consider growing your own food or investing in a wood stove. But don't forget the most important thing: get to know your neighbors, and be willing to lend a hand (or ask for one) when you need it.",
            "The age-old question remains: why do organisms evolve the way they do? Are there any boundaries or constraints that dictate the direction of evolutionary change? It's a mystery that has puzzled scientists for over a century – even the renowned biologist D'Arcy Thompson noted in 1917 that \"even now, the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms.\" Yet, despite the passage of time, we still don't have a clear answer.\n\nRecently, however, scientists have started to use mathematical modeling to better understand the intricate dance of evolutionary change in organisms. One group of researchers, for instance, has applied mathematical modeling to the development of mollusk shells, examining both their growth patterns and evolutionary history (Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our own study is taking a similar approach, combining mathematical modeling with experimental research to uncover the underlying mechanisms that drive evolutionary change in the snail genus Prunum.\n\nWe used X-ray images of Prunum species to identify key characteristics that can be used to model hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. These parameters were then fed into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995), allowing us to create virtual shell shapes that can be used to explore the boundaries of possible morphological change.\n\nIn essence, a shell can be thought of as a spiral tube that grows over time, with each coil or whorl representing a specific point in the organism's life history. The central axis of the shell, known as the columella, runs through its center, and each whorl is separated by a continuous line called a suture. The speed at which these whorls grow can vary, and the largest whorl is typically the last one (the body whorl).\n\nWhen examining a shell, we can view it from different angles: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The most common orientation is apertural, where the opening of the shell faces the viewer, with the tip of the spire pointing upwards.\n\nTo count the whorls, we start by viewing the shell from the apical angle and identifying the first suture. We then draw a line dividing the shell into two parts, and count the whorls from this line, estimating each one to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can also be seen as a series of openings that move through time and space as the organism builds its shell. By tracking the coordinates of each whorl's aperture, as well as its horizontal and vertical radius, we can create a mathematical representation of the shell's growth trajectory. This allows us to manipulate the parameters of shell development and explore the possibilities of evolutionary change.",
            "We've been staring at some disturbing statistics for a decade, and it's time we take a closer look. Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have been stuck in a rut for the past ten years, and while the country is inching towards meeting some of the Millennium Development Goals, progress in child and maternal health is woefully off track. The harsh reality is that the country's approach needs a serious overhaul – it's time to shift focus from program-specific fixes to strengthening the health system as a whole. \n\nIndonesia's made some headway in getting skilled health workers present during births, with 72% of births now meeting this standard. But don't be fooled – this figure includes traditional midwives who can't provide medical interventions when complications arise, leading to a disproportionate number of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage. What's more, the percentage of children under five treated for diarrheal cases has taken a hit, and postnatal care is a dark area where data is scarce, with low rates across the country.\n\nThe alarming low rate of cesarean sections, at around 4%, points to a deeper issue. The rate is 7% in urban areas, but a mere 2% in rural regions, highlighting the glaring disparities in healthcare access. It's clear that urban areas are getting the lion's share of healthcare services, leaving rural communities in the dust. The issue of vertical equity further exacerbates the problem, with a staggering 27% gap between the poorest and richest quintiles – the poor are finding it nearly impossible to access healthcare due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nSo, what's next for Indonesia? The most pressing question is how to address the glaring lack of access to healthcare services. Should the country focus on program-specific approaches or take a more holistic approach to strengthening the health system? While targeted, vertically-oriented programs have their appeal, they come with significant drawbacks. For one, investing heavily in one area often means neglecting others, and human resources get sucked into areas with more funding. Furthermore, running multiple parallel programs leads to duplication and disorganization, resulting in a logistical nightmare.",
            "Victorian novels are characterized by an intense focus on the intricacies of the upper class during that era. However, two notable exceptions are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  These novels deviate from the norm by incorporating elements of mystery and the bizarre, which serves to deepen our understanding of the characters' motivations and emotions. This unique approach allows readers to gain a more profound insight into the inner workings of their minds.\n\nAs Oliver Twist navigated the treacherous world of Victorian London, his mind became a jumble of confusing and bewildering thoughts. He found himself lost in a haze of hallucinations, reliving fragments of his past and struggling to distinguish reality from fantasy. In one particularly vivid sequence, the sound of gunfire shattered the silence, and Oliver was swept away by an unseen force. His senses were overwhelmed, and he was left reeling from the pain and fear that seemed to have become an integral part of his existence.\n\nThis use of dreamlike states in Oliver Twist serves to highlight Oliver's feelings of powerlessness and despair. His inability to control the events that unfolded around him is a refrain that echoes throughout the novel. The shooting itself becomes a symbol of the hopelessness that has consumed Oliver, a reminder that he is a pawn in a much larger game. His lack of agency is further underscored by his inability to react, even when his very life is at stake. It is as if Fagin's influence has worn him down, leaving him a broken and defeated individual.\n\nIn Wuthering Heights, the dreamlike sequences take on a different form. The passage describing the long and sleepless night that followed the tumultuous events of the day is a testament to the author's ability to craft a sense of atmosphere and mood. The words \"day\" and \"night\" become interchangeable, blurring the lines between reality and fantasy. This sense of disorientation serves to underscore the characters' emotional states, which are as turbulent as the weather that surrounds them.",
            "It's a memory that still sticks out in my mind - working in an after-school program, trying to help elementary-age students with their studies. I did my best to assist them in areas where they needed improvement, but my strengths lay in English and reading. However, one student in particular - a boy named Adrian, whom I believe was in the third or fourth grade at the time - proved to be a puzzle. He was having trouble reading, but what struck me as odd was the way he struggled with certain letters, while others seemed to come easily to him. His fluency in English was impressive, considering I suspected he was of Latino descent. \n\nAs I worked with him, it became increasingly clear that something was amiss. We made little progress until the day his mother walked in, speaking only Spanish. With my limited Spanish skills, we managed to communicate, and I had a revelation: Adrian could read just fine, but he was struggling with the English alphabet. I'm not sure how much this insight helped him in the long run, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the issue of the language barrier in schools, especially in California. It's not always as straightforward as we might think, even for students who speak perfect English. Reading can be a significant obstacle, and I'm sure everyone agrees that this is a problem. So, what's the solution? For Adrian, it was as simple as extra tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for students who barely speak English, the answer is much more complex.\n\nThere's no one-size-fits-all solution to this problem. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes - none of these approaches can fix the issue on their own. The key lies in combining them all. \n\nFirstly, the dual language system is a great concept, not just for children who speak Spanish as their first language, but for all students. Research has shown that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Many people fear that these programs are a waste of resources, claiming that the majority of students won't benefit. But that's just not true. If we implemented these programs as the norm, rather than the exception, all students would benefit. So, how do we make this work? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? No, that's unrealistic. But I do think it's reasonable to have bilingual assistants, tutors, or whatever you want to call them, to support our teachers.",
            "As we grow up, many of us are told that there's something greater than ourselves out there, something beyond our understanding. Some of us attend Sunday school, while others seek answers in temples or within their own minds. Many of us adopt the faith handed down to us by our parents, but others reject it entirely, believing that there's only what we can grasp within our own egocentric world. Our values can shift over time, and we may go on to find new meaning in different spiritual paths. We're on a journey to discover ourselves through our own unique perspectives on the mysteries of existence and to find a guiding light in the darkness.\n\nI still remember a conversation I had with my dad about his favorite type of bird – the cardinal. We sat on our front porch, listening to the rain drumming on the tin roof as we both smoked our cigarettes. The rain poured down from the gutters, drowning the plants on the edge of the porch. My dad gazed out into the rain, his expression a mix of searching and remembering. He'd lost weight and his clothes hung loosely on his frail body. His hair had thinned out, too. I sensed his pain and my own fear as we sat there in silence. I felt a lump in my throat, unable to bring up the topic of how much I'd miss him – talking about it would only make it more real for both of us. I hugged him, moved my chair closer to his, and sat down beside him, both of us lost in the rain's rhythmic beat.\n\nMy dad passed away that December, just five days after my 22nd birthday. The chemotherapy and radiation had prolonged his life beyond the doctors' predictions, but it was a hollow extension – what was the value in mere survival when he suffered so much? I remember questioning a God who would allow this. Alone at night, I didn't say any prayers. If God existed, I thought, he'd stopped listening to me a long time ago.\n\nI didn't want to witness my dad's passing, so I didn't. I couldn't watch the man who'd given me life slip away. I chose to remember him by how he lived, not how he died. I knew my dad better than anyone else; I knew he wouldn't have wanted me to be a spectator at his death. For three days, I curled up in bed, waiting for the news. But no one even called me.",
            "I've always thought that the term \"Gothic Novel\" is a perfect oxymoron - \"old\" and \"new\" all wrapped into one. As Ian Watt so aptly puts it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, this genre is a paradox that has been met with both disdain and adoration. Some have dismissed it as lacking substance, while others have praised it for evoking the 'terrible sublime' (a concept Burke explored). The roots of the Gothic genre date back to Horace Walpole's novel, The Castle of Otranto, which cleverly merged elements from both ancient and modern romances to create something entirely new. By combining the old theatrical flair of medieval gothic theatre with the modern novel's ability to delve into character psychology, Walpole managed to craft a style that would endure for centuries, despite being both obsolete and innovative at the same time.\n\nOne of the key elements that defines the Gothic genre is the concept of chivalry. In the medieval era, chivalry represented the epitome of knighthood - bravery, honor, and competence. However, as Walpole and other Gothic writers saw it, this ideal had largely disappeared from modern society. In his novel, The Castle of Otranto, Walpole romanticized the gothic past, using chivalric concepts to critique the present. This was particularly relevant given the tumultuous times in which he wrote - a period marked by political upheaval and unfair accusations. Walpole's character, Frederic, is a prime example of this idealized chivalry. Described as a prince who has suffered greatly, he embodies the traditional chivalric traits - courtesy, gallantry, and a sense of justice. However, his portrayal is also exaggerated, introducing the concept of excess that would become a staple of the Gothic genre.",
            "I still remember the early 80s when the concept of supply chain management burst onto the scene, revolutionizing the way goods moved from raw materials to customer satisfaction. Keith Oliver, a visionary consultant, coined the term in 1982, and it has been a game-changer ever since. He described the intricate process of planning, implementing, and controlling the supply chain to deliver what customers want, quickly and efficiently. The supply chain is a complex web of six interconnected elements: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Savvy business managers master these elements to provide top-notch customer service.\n\nProduction is the foundation of the supply chain, where everything begins. It's the when, why, where, and how of production, setting the stage for the entire process. To get it right, managers need to tap into customer demand, and the market is the best barometer for that. By analyzing market trends and customer needs, managers can decide what products to produce, in what quantities, and where to produce them – all while keeping customer satisfaction top of mind. It's a delicate balance, but one that's crucial to success. I should know; I've seen it firsthand in my previous stints at retail heavyweights like Wal-Mart and Target. These companies have meticulous processes in place, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments from trucks. It's a well-oiled machine that hums along smoothly when every detail is planned to perfection.\n\nThe supply element is another key cog in the supply chain machine. It's all about making strategic decisions about your core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. A company might have multiple divisions for a single product, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers must choose which division is the best fit for each process, and sometimes, that means outsourcing to other companies. The goal is to create velocity – delivering high-quality products with flexibility and keeping costs low.",
            "There's a jarring message scrawled on a cardboard sign held aloft by Ellen Page, a Juno actress, on a city street corner. The somber words, scribbled with a Sharpie, declare: 'Hitler is alive in Burma'. Burma, or Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation plagued by a ruthless military dictatorship that seized power in 1962 through a bloody coup d'état. In 2007, a wave of street protests erupted, the first public demonstrations in over a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests were dubbed 'The Saffron Revolution' after the color of their traditional robes. As the public's interest in the protests grew, the Burmese government initially allowed the monks to gather peacefully, but the situation soon escalated into a brutal conflict between the monks and the military junta, with the military invading and ransacking monasteries across the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned, and a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was tragically killed on September 27, 2007, simply for witnessing a street protest. While the official death toll is reported to be 13, Colonel Hla Win, a former army defector, alleged that many more people were killed, with the bodies numbering in the thousands.\n\nThis is nothing new. A government's insatiable desire to suppress dissent and maintain total control over its citizens has been a recurring theme throughout human history. Ancient Roman emperors claimed divine right to absolute power over every aspect of their society. In Japan, emperors are still revered as deities, sent to lead their people to prosperity through innovation and self-discipline. Our current president, George W. Bush, reportedly held regular conference calls with Ted Haggard, a prominent Christian leader, who was once at the helm of Stupid People Worldwide, a fringe organization with ties to the Republican Party.\n\nSome of the most shocking examples of these actions include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where students, intellectuals, and labor activists gathered to challenge the authoritarian rule of the Chinese government. The death toll from that event varies wildly, with official reports ranging from 200-300 to reports from the Chinese Red Cross, which estimated between 2,000-3,000 dead. Another harrowing example is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, backed by the Rwandan government, systematically targeted and killed Tutsis and political moderates, regardless of their ethnic backgrounds. The atrocities committed during Hitler's 'Third Reich' are another extreme example of a government's brutal suppression of dissent and minority groups.",
            "Duke Ellington's timeless contribution to jazz is largely due to his remarkable longevity and, by extension, his boundless creativity in shaping his orchestra. Though his piano presence is understated in many of the compositions featured here, Ellington excelled as a composer by crafting rich, intricate pieces that showcased the distinct talents of his band members. He skillfully created a framework where soloists could improvise freely, while also writing tightly orchestrated sections that highlighted the unique styles of individual musicians. This approach not only allowed him to emphasize the overall tone of the orchestra but also resulted in coherent and original sounds that perfectly suited each piece. Ellington's mastery of the individual players' voices and how they blended together in a growing ensemble enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative approach to sound and his use of voice as a jazz instrument in his long career, citing Creole Love Call as a prime example. This early piece showcases Ellington's ability to incorporate voice without lyrics, adding texture and depth to the music. The song's twelve-bar blues structure, featuring six distinct choruses, demonstrates Ellington's skill in complementing the style of his soloists. The choruses unfold as follows:\n\nChorus 1: A call-and-response exchange between voice and reeds, with the voice beginning smooth and melodic before transitioning to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo elaborates on the basic melody, emphasizing several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus, with a call-and-response between the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus, as the reeds initiate the call-and-response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call-and-response between voice and reeds. In this final chorus, the voice takes on the sound of the \"growl\" technique, soloing as an instrument.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to his music is a hallmark of his style. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, he combines his skill in tight orchestration with his ear for tone color, creating a rich and complementary sound through a call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "For as long as she could remember, there was a gnawing sense of discontent within her. This hollowness refused to be filled, lingering since her early teenage years. By the time she was 17, it had become a persistent ache that wouldn't subside. She began to realize that what she craved wasn't a thing, but a connection – a human connection that eluded her. Yet, she found herself unresponsive to the boys who showed interest, leaving her puzzled about what was missing. She often found herself questioning her own desires, searching for answers that seemed to evade her, even as the years went by. Theories emerged, but none provided a satisfactory explanation for this peculiar phenomenon.\n\nHer home life was usually a serene bubble. Her parents were calm and peaceful, rarely arguing with each other. When they did have disagreements, they were usually with her, stemming from their desire to let her spread her wings and be her free-spirited self. They balanced each other out, but she added her own unique energy to the mix – a lively, lovable, and kind-hearted individual who brought warmth to those around her.\n\nHowever, today was different. As she wandered from room to room, seeking inspiration, the sound of her mother's distressed cry pierced the air from the kitchen. She rushed in, panic setting in as she frantically asked, \"Mom, what's wrong?!\" Her mother lay on the ground, wincing in pain, repeating \"Ow\" in short, labored gasps. Her daughter rushed to her side, placing a supporting hand on her mother's shoulder. \"Ouch... sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital,\" her mother managed to say, her words strained and urgent. The daughter sprang into action, grateful for the strength she'd gained from prior training, as she carefully lifted her mother and helped her to the car.\n\nThe hospital's antiseptic scent and eerie atmosphere hung in the air, weighed down by an undercurrent of fear. Yet, her focus remained on her mother's well-being as she quickly guided her into a treatment room and called for medical help. The doctors and nurses rushed in, and soon her mother was being tended to, while she sat anxiously waiting.\n\nIt turned out her mother had taken a tumble off a stool while trying to retrieve a vase from the top cabinet.",
            "I've always been fascinated by the profound impact of diet on our well-being, particularly when it comes to the Mediterranean diet, also known as \"Med diet.\" This study aimed to uncover the relationship between adherence to a modified version of the Med diet, dubbed the \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet,\" and the risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke. The aMed diet is characterized by a higher intake of plant-based foods, monounsaturated fats, and fish, alongside a lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate amounts of alcohol are also allowed.\n\nPast studies have demonstrated a clear inverse correlation between adherence to the Med diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. Another study showed that the Med diet outperformed a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. However, previous research has focused primarily on mortality and weight loss, leaving the relationship between the Med diet and stroke or stroke mortality largely unexplored.\n\nThis study followed a staggering 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study that observes 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Over the course of 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, the researchers computed an aMed diet score six times, using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" that gauged nutrient intake over the preceding year. An impressive 95% of the nurses remained part of the study throughout this period. The questionnaires were validated through medical and hospital records, autopsy reports, and death certificates. For cases where records were unavailable, \"probable\" cases were included, accounting for around 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts.\n\nTo minimize random variation and better capture long-term dietary intake, the researchers calculated cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated questionnaires. They also adjusted for potential confounders, such as age, smoking status, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing Cox proportional-hazard modeling, the researchers examined the association between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, with separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. The results showed that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was linked to a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. During the 20-year follow-up period, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were identified. Women in the top aMed quintile were at a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "It's hard to believe it's been over a decade since the United States was rocked by a devastating financial crisis. The job market was decimated, the housing market imploded, and some of the country's biggest and most influential corporations were left reeling. As we look back, it's time to ask the tough questions: what led to this disaster, and how can we prevent it from happening again? In a nutshell, the crisis was a direct result of reckless and naive decision-making by politicians who put pressure on banks and financial institutions to issue sub-prime loans into a fragile and underdeveloped financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac got caught up in the chaos, forced to buy and repackage these dodgy mortgages into complex financial instruments like CDOs and CDSs. When homebuyers defaulted on these loans, the banks were left with huge losses, which they then passed on to the rest of the economy.\n\nLooking back, the roots of the financial crisis lay in the late 1990s, when President Clinton was looking to secure a second term in office. To boost his popularity, his administration relaxed lending regulations, setting the stage for the sub-prime disaster that would unfold seven years later. Stephen Holmes of the New York Times sounded the alarm in 1999, warning that Fannie Mae was under pressure to expand mortgage lending to low-income borrowers and maintain its profits. He foresaw the consequences of this reckless approach: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As we now know, ill-advised lending would ultimately lead to an economic meltdown.\n\nA perfect storm of factors contributed to the economic collapse, including the proliferation of complex mortgage products like adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These instruments tied more and more sectors of the economy to the housing market, leaving households and financial markets overexposed and vulnerable to even minor changes in the housing market. When the housing bubble burst, the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were left reeling. The five biggest U.S. investment banks reported a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, equivalent to about 30% of the country's GDP. In the end, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at fire-sale prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to transform into commercial banks subject to tough regulations. Fannie and Freddie were saddled with $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were taken under government control in September 2008.",
            "The pitfalls of exposition - that great expanse of narrative where the unwary writer's wings can falter, leaving readers yawning and scrambling for the \"Back\" button.  Dr. Merlin has been known to let out a frustrated cry at her screen when she finds herself bogged down in a sea of unnecessary detail. Exposition can be a necessary evil, but it's not exactly the most exciting part of writing.\n\nEven seasoned authors like Dr. Merlin often struggle with the temptation to dump too much information on their readers, forgetting the cardinal rule: \"Show, don't tell.\"  The goal is to engage, not to lecture or recite a laundry list of facts. Exposition is like that pesky little voice in your head that says, \"Let's get this over with, so we can get to the good stuff.\" But what's the \"good stuff\" if not a rich tapestry of characters, plot, and emotion?\n\nTake, for instance, a scenario where a writer tells us that a heroine met her beloved at a certain time and place, got married in a grand ceremony, and then had her husband brutally murdered in front of her eyes.  Would it be wise to spend two pages on this sequence, with nary a word of dialogue between the two?  Probably not.  Instead, the author should take the time to flesh out the husband's character - his words, his mannerisms, the way he loves his wife.  We should see the heroine's transformation, her growth, her dependence on him.  By doing so, we become invested in their relationship, their fate, and the heroine's emotional journey.\n\nIn short, we crave more than just the bare bones of a storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"  We want the meat that makes it real, that makes us care.  So, as writers, let's resist the urge to speed through the exposition and focus on crafting a narrative that truly comes alive.",
            "I caught two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was NBC 4, live this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was a disturbing one about a man in Ashley, Ohio who'd stabbed his wife. The news team didn't reveal her name, but showed a mugshot of the perpetrator, Shad Hostettler. He looked every bit the part of a malevolent figure. The report was concise, lasting only about two minutes, as the story was still unfolding. I thought they gave it enough airtime.\n\nThe next story I saw was about an 18-year-old named Travis Buyers, who'd been shot in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically injured but no arrests had been made. The SWAT Team was on the case. This particular story seemed short-lived, and I suspect it might have been due to the fact that the victim and the neighborhood were from a minority background. I've noticed for years that crimes committed against minorities often get glossed over, while the media goes into frenzy when a white victim is involved.\n\nThe news cycle then shifted to a story about a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. They provided details about where the incident likely occurred and revealed that a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle was to blame. Crime-Stoppers was offering a substantial reward for any information leading to the shooter's capture.\n\nNext up was a brief report about the impending rain and thunderstorms forecasted for Saturday afternoon. The temperature was expected to remain steady in the mid to low eighties for the weekend, but they seemed to be teasing the story rather than providing a thorough update.\n\nThey also ran with a story about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The perpetrator was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie and standing about six feet tall and weighing 150 pounds. I was struck by how much emphasis was placed on his skin color and the fact that he was dark-skinned. It seemed an unusual amount of time was dedicated to these unnecessary details.\n\nAnother story featured Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin, who'd been found guilty of conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. I was puzzled by the way his sentence was reported - instead of saying he was sentenced to 25 years in prison, they said \"300 months.\" I'm not sure if they thought this phrasing sounded harsher or if it was just a quirk. They also highlighted his Hispanic heritage, but I'm not convinced it was relevant to the story.",
            "The connection between brothers is a complex and unbreakable one, woven with threads of love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. It's a bond that transcends words and understanding, one that can only be truly grasped by those who have experienced it firsthand. Brothers have a unique ability to see themselves reflected in one another, a characteristic that becomes starkly apparent in the most trying of times. Whether the emotions that arise from this bond are positive or negative, they come with a steep price. To truly comprehend the intricacies of fraternal love, one must confront the consequences that come with it. Looking into the eyes of a brother is like gazing into a mirror, revealing a person's true nature, beyond the façade that others may see. It's in their actions and the aftermath of those actions that a person's character is truly revealed. \n\nIn James Hurst's poignant tale, \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" this theme is masterfully explored through the complex relationships between two brothers. Against the backdrop of a lush, vividly described landscape, their journey unfolds as a poignant exploration of the messy emotions that accompany brotherhood. Bitter disappointment and intense pride collide in a heart-wrenching climax, resulting in a sobering conclusion that leaves only one brother standing. The narrative weaves together a nuanced portrait of the protagonist and his younger brother, Doodle, whose fragile existence is marked by a weak heart that renders him unsuitable for the physical pursuits that the older brother had envisioned for them. The older brother's desire for a companion to share in his adventures is met with crushing disappointment, leading him to harbor feelings of resentment towards his sibling. His anger is almost palpable, as he recalls contemplating the unthinkable – suffocating Doodle with a pillow. However, a single, radiant smile from his brother is enough to melt his resolve, revealing a glimmer of the love that lies beneath his surface. This tender moment suggests that his capacity for cruelty may not be as strong as he initially thought. Throughout the narrative, the reader is left to ponder the complexities of brotherly love and the far-reaching consequences that it entails.",
            "We've all seen the incredible complexity of the human brain. As technology has advanced, so have the metaphors we use to describe it. From the primitive wax tablet to the modern computer, our understanding of the brain has evolved significantly. However, it's essential to remember that these metaphors have their limitations and can lead to misconceptions.\n\nWhen sensory information enters our brains, it's like a puzzle, with our sensory organs transforming physical stimuli into electrochemical signals. The brain's algorithms process this information in layers, both from the bottom up and from the top down. For instance, when gazing at a picture of a black box on a white background, the brain's bottom-up processing starts by identifying the colors, orientation, and borders of the object, ultimately concluding that you're looking at a box. Meanwhile, top-down processing uses the decisions made at earlier stages to speed up your recognition, determining whether you're looking at a box or a hole in the background.\n\nOnce the brain has processed the information to a certain degree, an attention filter kicks in to determine which signals are most important and which cognitive processes should be engaged. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. On the other hand, you might pick out your name even in a noisy room.\n\nThe brain's processing is a multi-stage process, with results modulated by attention at each stage. For information to be processed, it must first be stored in the brain. There are various types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. When information is first stored, it's encoded in a specific way, depending on the type of sensory input. For instance, verbal input can be encoded based on its appearance, sound, or meaning.\n\nOnce information is stored, it must be maintained. Research suggests that working memory, which stores information for about 20 seconds, relies on an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period. Long-term memory, on the other hand, is thought to be maintained through the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are numerous models of how knowledge is organized in the brain, ranging from how humans retrieve memories to computer science and neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that there are nodes representing concepts, linked based on their relatedness. For example, in this model, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley paints a chilling picture of a dystopian world in his novel Brave New World, where technology and capitalism are intertwined to create a society where the individual is subjugated to the collective. The people of this world value community above all else, and from a very young age, they're conditioned to prioritize instant gratification. The citizens of this world are mere pawns in a grand game, forced to adhere to a single ideology dictated by the World Controller. Examining Huxley's work through the lens of Marxist theory reveals a deep-seated distrust of the systems he saw emerging around him. Key Marxist concepts like homogeny and reification abound, solidifying the notion that Brave New World is a scathing critique of the economic system of his time.\n\nThe capitalist machinery is cleverly satirized by Huxley through the concept of false consciousness. The average citizen is oblivious to the true nature of their economic relationships with other classes, consumed instead by their own self-interest. This is achieved through the ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, a phenomenon that's starkly evident in the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The lower classes, categorized as Deltas and Gammas, lack any genuine sense of self-determination; hypnopædia is used to fuel their desire to consume and indulge above all else. This manipulation is orchestrated by the World Controller, demonstrating the grip of hegemony – the idea that dominant social groups control and dominate others.\n\nThe lower classes are unwittingly complicit in this system, mindlessly buying into an ideology that sustains it. Meanwhile, the upper classes, like the Alphas and Betas, are cognizant of the manipulation but choose to do nothing, perpetuating the status quo. The interactions between characters in Brave New World are superficial, devoid of genuine relationships and depth. Huxley may be suggesting that the union of technology and capitalism extinguishes humanity's capacity for free will and self-expression. The absence of true love and deep emotions is evident in the shallow conversations between characters, often revolving around physical appearance and surface-level interactions. The complacency of each social class within their designated hierarchy is a telling indicator of the insidious effects of capitalism on the proletariat, as they're led to believe their superiority is tied to their ability to conform and consume.",
            "I've been a student here at University Park for nearly three years now - roughly four and a half semesters. As a student, I'm not alone in my struggles to navigate this sprawling campus. My freshman year, I was stuck in an East Halls dorm room, on the far eastern edge of campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in buildings like Willard, which are centrally located, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially when the weather turns gloomy, which it often does in State College.  I had a chance conversation with an alum not much older than me, and it turned out that not so long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the campus by massive empty tracts of land. Fast forward to today, and that vacant space has been filled in with sports fields, brand-new buildings, and a series of apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another is becoming increasingly difficult. So, what's the solution to this mobility conundrum? On a college campus, the answer is clear: the humble bicycle. But having a bike is just the starting point. Students need to ride them regularly, and the campus needs to be designed with cyclists in mind.\n\nI recently caught up with a friend who's recently dusted off his bike after a few years away from cycling. He mused to me, \"Bikes are great - for a few years it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Not only is cycling good for your physical health, it's also the most efficient mode of transportation. With a bowl of oatmeal and some physical exertion, you can cover 30 miles or more. As an off-campus resident, just like many of my peers, I've made the smart decision to buy a bike this year. With classes in Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my home, I can significantly cut down that time to just 5 minutes if I pedal hard enough. The only catch is, Pollock Road is the most direct route to Thomas building from my house, but it's not always easy to navigate, bike or otherwise. I'm not a fan of walking, so having a bike has been a lifesaver. If I didn't have my trusty bike, I'd have to rely on walking, which would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That's over two and a half hours every week. When you factor in the time I'd need to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and so on, it's a staggering amount of time I just can't spare."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the course of my academic journey, I've come to realize that a career in social work is where my passions and values align. I'm drawn to the Division of Family and Children Services, where I can make a meaningful difference in the lives of kids who've been mistreated or neglected, and support families in turmoil. My personal values – service, respect, integrity, and a commitment to self-improvement – aren't just ideals for social workers; they're fundamental principles that guide me every day. For instance, I believe in serving others without expectation of reward, respecting the dignity of every individual, and upholding the highest standards of ethics. I'm also committed to helping people build stronger relationships and continually honing my skills to stay adaptable and effective in my role.\n\nWhile I've always wanted to make a positive impact, I wasn't sure how to channel my energy. Throughout high school and college, I watched as people around me struggled to cope with challenges in unhealthy ways. That's why I pursued a degree in Psychology, hoping to understand the complexities of human behavior. Although I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009, I still felt uncertain about my career path. Everything changed when I visited a friend who was hosting a vulnerable teenager seeking refuge from an abusive home life. The following day, I learned he'd called the authorities to intervene. To see if I could help, I went to his parents' house, where I discreetly shared my concerns with the police and mentioned my recent Psychology degree. They asked me to speak with the parents, as there wasn't much they could do. When I confronted them about their behavior, they seemed evasive and made excuses for their son's actions. That experience made me realize the need for social workers who can help families navigate conflicts and provide support.\n\nAnother essential aspect of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim to value individuality, but our actions often suggest otherwise. We idealize conformity and criticize those who break the mold. I've never been one to shy away from challenging these norms. Throughout my time in high school and college, I expressed my individuality through my appearance, hobbies, and activism. I've worn my hair in bold colors, pierced my ears in unconventional ways, and spoken out against racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it. I believe in fighting for social justice and will continue to do so in my career as a social worker.",
            "Sleepless nights can be a real puzzle, and the age-old question of why we can't seem to catch a wink has been a topic of interest for years. This paper dives into the two primary models that attempt to explain insomnia: the biological and sociocultural models. The biological model zeroes in on the genetic information we inherit, as well as the medical aspects of our overall health. On the other hand, the sociocultural model explores how environmental factors, like our cultural background, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status, contribute to our sleep patterns. By examining various studies related to these models, we aim to gain a better understanding of the intricate relationships between genetics, environment, and sleep.\n\nInsomnia can manifest in different ways - as a standalone disorder, linked to another mental health condition, or caused by external factors like medical complications or substance intake. The primary sleep disorders fall under two categories: Dyssonias and Parasomnias. Dyssonias, which include Primary Insomnia and Narcolepsy, primarily affect the ability to fall asleep or stay asleep. Parasomnias, such as Nightmare Disorder and Sleep Terror Disorder, are characterized by abnormal behaviors and physiological occurrences during sleep. Our focus lies in understanding the biological and sociocultural factors that contribute to insomnia, a sleep disorder that can significantly impact daily life.\n\nFrom a biological perspective, research suggests that our genes play a significant role in regulating our sleep-wake cycles. A study on mice discovered that neurons in the hypothalamus, containing orexin, are responsible for controlling our sleep patterns. The activation of the GABAB receptor, found on these neurons, promotes sleep, while its inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and improved sleep quality. A study using the GABAB agonist (baclofen) showed an increase in sleep time in mice, indicating a potential genetic basis for sleep regulation in humans. This finding implies that an alteration in the GABAB receptor could lead to sleep disturbances, negatively impacting daily life and tasks that require focus and attention.\n\nThe sociocultural implications of this study are profound. If the GABAB receptor is inherited, it could regulate sleep patterns, and any alteration to this receptor could naturally disrupt sleep, affecting various aspects of life. This highlights the complex interplay between genetics, environment, and sleep, suggesting that a deeper understanding of these factors is crucial in addressing insomnia.",
            "I still recall the first time I delved into the complex world of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD). It's a disorder where the central nervous system, the brain, has trouble processing auditory information, leaving individuals with normal hearing unable to properly decipher sounds, differentiate conversations from background noise, or separate words. The disorder's history dates back to the 1950s when researchers began identifying it as \"auditory imperception\" while studying children with communicative disorders.\n\nAs I continued to learn about CAPD, I discovered that it's a multifaceted condition, manifesting in various ways. Some individuals may struggle to localize sounds, differentiate between multiple acoustic events, or recognize sound patterns. Others may have difficulty detecting changes in speech, such as sarcasm, or interpreting sound clues. The disorder can also make it challenging for individuals to determine the sequence of auditory information presented to them.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD requires a systematic evaluation of listening behavior and performance on tests of auditory function. This may involve various professionals, including audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists, using a range of measures to assess auditory-related skills. No single tool or test has been proven to be consistently effective in diagnosing CAPD, and the underlying cause remains unknown. Tests may present individuals with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and ask them to differentiate certain items, such as words or numbers. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring responses to these signals.\n\nAs a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom, helping a student with CAPD requires a thoughtful and supportive approach. By understanding the disorder and its effects, educators can create a more inclusive and supportive environment for students with CAPD. This includes adapting teaching methods, providing additional support, and being patient with students who may struggle to process auditory information.",
            "We see in Twelfth Night that a disguise, though useful for pulling off an elaborate deception, ultimately forces the wearer to confront the consequences of their actions. Rejection of the disguise is inevitable, but this can lead to feelings of isolation, as one risks losing touch with their true self in the process. The trouble lies in deciding between preserving one's own identity and maintaining relationships with those around them. While some may take a deception lightly, others may be deeply offended by it, highlighting a delicate balance between self-preservation and connection with others.\n\nThe topic of deception in Twelfth Night, specifically through the lens of gender role reversal, raises more questions than answers. Why do characters like Viola feel the need to adopt a disguise, and what lies beneath this desire? For Viola, disguising herself as a man is a means of self-protection, as evidenced by her lines \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count.\" (5.1.247-249) Her plan succeeds, but it also cuts her off from the support of other women, leaving her isolated and struggling to navigate her suppressed emotions.\n\nAs a foreigner in a new land, Viola's disguise makes her so convincing that Olivia falls in love with her, mistaking her for her twin brother Sebastian. Meanwhile, Viola must also contend with her own unrequited love for Orsino, who seems to hold a deep affection for her as Cesario. This may seem progressive to modern readers, but Twelfth Night can also be seen as a exploration of how deception can reveal hidden desires, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages suggest that their attraction to Cesario may be a manifestation of unexpressed emotions, but it's also possible that Olivia's affection is a satirical commentary on the superficiality of her time, as she quickly switches her affections to Sebastian and regards Cesario/Viola as a sister rather than a love interest, as seen in her line \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315)",
            "The brutal nature of German colonial rule has been well-documented, with numerous observers highlighting the devastating impact on the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, the German colonial empire was a complex entity, with a diverse array of policies, styles, and geographies. Educational provision across its territories was similarly varied. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a surprisingly well-educated and literate African population. German efforts in Kamerun and other colonies had also been praised by contemporary authors, who acknowledged their successes in promoting education.\n\nBut South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast. Unlike East Africa, where the government invested heavily in state schools and education for locals, in South West Africa, the task of educating the native population fell largely to underfunded missionary societies. The government did, however, devote significant resources to educating Europeans, establishing state schools and closely regulating missionary institutions. This educational divide had long-lasting effects on South West Africa, even after German rule had ended. Other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, whereas in South West Africa, the vast majority of the population remained uneducated and illiterate.\n\nA multitude of social, political, and economic factors contributed to the divergent experience of South West Africa. To shed more light on this phenomenon, this paper aims to delve deeper into the underlying causes and scrutinize new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThe scholarly literature on German colonial education is vast, with many sources written in German during the early twentieth century. These early works focused on describing the features of educational systems in the colonies. Later studies, written in English, broadened the discussion by comparing education in different German colonies and providing in-depth analyses of specific aspects of education. Notably, Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa stands out for its comprehensive comparison of the two colonies and its identification of the key factors that drove their educational differences. According to Cohen, the presence of a large settler population in South West Africa was a major contributor to the colony's unique educational system.\n\nCompared to other German colonies, South West Africa had a relatively temperate climate, with arid desert regions making up a significant portion of the territory. This relatively hospitable environment drew a substantial European population to the area, with nearly 15,000 whites living in South West Africa by 1913. In contrast, East Africa, with its smaller settler population, had fewer than 5,400 European residents at the same time.",
            "The class of Popular Music has ballooned over the past 100 years, now boasting an impossibly long list of genres that seems impossible to catalogue. And if that weren't enough, many of these genres - rock, country, jazz, folk, and more - have spawned a dizzying array of sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, each branching off from the last. One genre that has arguably become the most adventurous and expressive of all is Heavy Metal, which has been expressing a wide range of emotions over the past 40 years, albeit with a clear lean towards the darker side of the emotional spectrum.\n\nHeavy Metal's flexibility has allowed it to incorporate diverse styles and themes from other genres, and people have jumped at the chance to create their own sub-genres, which in turn gave birth to even more sub-sub-genres. Fast-forward to today, and the Heavy Metal movement is so fragmented that it's hard to pin down exactly what Heavy Metal even is. To truly understand the dizzying array of metal music out there, you need to grasp what the metal movement is all about, and why it's so much more than just a genre.\n\nAt its core, Metal is a movement defined by its darkness, a music of excess - more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatrics. And yet, it's also a movement where musicians are all about showcasing their chops, pushing the limits of what's possible on their instruments. Metal's also inextricably linked to the world of psychedelics, with the mid-70s counterculture inspiring musicians to create music that was truly otherworldly. The result was a sound that was both visceral and deeply unsettling, a departure from the more upbeat, feel-good music that dominated the airwaves. Later generations of metal musicians drew inspiration from this darker, more primal energy, infusing it with the Gothic Romanticism of the era.\n\nLyrics like those found in Helter Skelter, a song often cited as one of the first Heavy Metal tracks, showcase the movement's penchant for the dark and the visceral. Written by the Beatles in response to the Rolling Stones' own darker offerings, Helter Skelter is a testament to the pioneering spirit of Heavy Metal, a genre that continues to evolve and branch out in all directions.",
            "It's only fitting that Henri Rousseau, the pioneering Post-Impressionist artist, should have been crafting his own dreamlike works years before the Surrealist movement even took off. His captivating 1910 painting, The Dream, not only depicts a woman marveling at the wonders of a fantastical land, but it's also a deeply personal reflection of Rousseau's own aspirations as an artist. Since embarking on his artistic journey, Rousseau had been driven by a burning desire for recognition, acceptance, and praise from his peers – a goal that ultimately led him to confront a daunting internal struggle. As he navigated his career, he found himself torn between conforming to established styles to gain acceptance from the art world he idolized, or forging his own path and embracing his unique voice.\n\nTo truly appreciate The Dream in this context, it's essential to delve into Rousseau's remarkable backstory. Born on May 21, 1844, in the charming town of Laval, northwest France, Henri Rousseau came from a relatively comfortable middle-class family, with his father working as a tinsmith and hardware dealer. Despite his comfortable upbringing, Rousseau never received formal art training, instead choosing to pursue a career in the municipal toll service, where he worked as a gabelou until the age of forty. The sobriquet 'douanier' – customs inspector – only added to his humble beginnings. The loss of his first wife, Clémence, and eight infant children left Rousseau heartbroken, and it was during this tumultuous time that he turned to painting as a source of comfort and rebirth. Unlike his contemporaries, who often romanticized the peasant class, Rousseau's folk art reflected the hopes and dreams of the common man.\n\nGiven his circumstances, Rousseau's quest for acceptance from the art world is more than understandable. As an uneducated artist who began his career at an older age, he was competing with some of the most talented and renowned modern artists of his time. It wasn't until around the same period that Matisse was establishing himself as an artist that Rousseau finally gained recognition. In her book Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon astutely observes that while both artists vied for recognition in the art world, their motivations and styles were vastly different: \"Matisse was driven by a fear of painting blandly, while Rousseau yearned to create something so conventional that he'd be welcomed into the Artiste Français.\"",
            "For centuries, philosophers have pondered an intriguing connection between ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. I firmly believe that at a fundamental level, there's a profound reason for this connection. As John Keats so eloquently puts it in his poem \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Our understanding of the world is largely shaped by education and experience, yet our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics seems to transcend these conventional paths of learning. Both ethics and aesthetics are more about describing the essence of something, rather than providing a set of strict guidelines.\n\nIn essence, our studies of morality and beauty are attempts to unpack why a piece of art or literature resonates with us, rather than a set of rigid rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior. Criticism of art or morals can never fully capture the essence of what makes something beautiful or right. Think of the countless debates about the Mona Lisa – they might revolve around concepts like composition, context, or cultural significance, but ultimately, these explanations fall short of describing why it's a masterpiece. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, we often hear a phrase like \"There's just something about it\" preceding a more in-depth analysis. I believe that both art and morals can never be reduced to a mere description of their qualities. As the brilliant Flannery O'Connor so astutely put it, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Similarly, ethics has this same elusive quality, as Ludwig Wittgenstein so eloquently stated, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\"\n\nI propose that it's this \"something\" – this je ne sais quoi – that is the most powerful attribute of both art and morality. This transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a common ground between them. I believe that morality and art are closely related because we experience both of them most profoundly at a level that can be felt, but not fully explained. This connection is especially strong when it comes to literature, as McKean so aptly observed, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany is a force to be reckoned with today - a unified country with a rich cultural tapestry woven from the threads of its alpine roots in München to the Baltic coast in Kiel.  This distinct cultural identity can be felt from the Rhine river town of Köln all the way to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. Given its unique cultural heritage, it's hardly surprising that modern Germany has its roots in the confluence of various tribes and influences. \n\nGermania, the ancestral homeland of the Germans, has a name shrouded in mystery. Scholars and historians are still debating its origins, with some pointing to a Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, whom Tacitus believed were previously known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and clashed with the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98). Others argue that Julius Caesar first coined the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, distinguishing between the Gauls he had conquered and the Germanic tribes he had yet to defeat. According to Caesar, the Gauls themselves used the term to refer to their neighbors, which he later adopted to describe the warring tribes beyond the Rhine (Caesar, 50-40 BC). Whether the term originated from the Gaulish language or derived from the spear used in warfare, known as a ger, or even the Old Irish word garim meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans were a vocal people, remains unclear. \n\nTacitus, an early Roman historian, penned his thoughts on the origins of the Germans in his 98 AD writing \"De Origine et situ Germanorum.\" In it, he described the Germans as an indigenous people, untouched by outside influences through immigration or trade. He quipped that who would choose to leave the warmth of Italy for the harsh climate and rugged landscape of Germany, unless it was their homeland? (Tacitus, 98) It's little wonder that the Romans, though they did launch conquests into Germania, rarely settled there, preferring to return to their sprawling empire. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the 1st century, they resided on the fringes of the Roman Empire, trading goods and skills acquired from their homeland for Roman patronage and military service (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).",
            "As I stood there, my mind was a blank slate, taking in the scene in front of me without any emotional response. It was as if I'd been trained to observe, but my brain refused to connect the dots, keeping my thoughts separate from any deeper understanding. My consciousness was in a state of pure observation, like a camera capturing the moment without interpretation. Thoughts flashed in and out of my mind, too fast to grasp, leaving my mental state eerily clear and uncluttered.\n\nI'd picked up 'The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain' on the advice of an artist I'd worked with, hoping to finally learn how to draw. That book explained the basics of art and how the brain processes lines, from understanding the tool to interpreting vision. One technique it taught was to surround a picture with a square frame, simplifying a complex scene into a manageable composition. At that moment, I stared at the unremarkable bowl of fruit in front of me, but my mind was too overwhelmed to apply that technique. I was frozen, mesmerized by the intricate details of the scene, unable to mentally impose the artist's frame.\n\nAs an aspiring artist, I felt like I was on the cusp of creating something special, like the start of my masterpiece, 'Work in Brown.' My hand instinctively reached for my drawing tool, my muscles tensing and relaxing as I prepared to bring my vision to life. But instead, my fingers landed on the toilet handle, and I was faced with an unwelcome reality. A stubborn brown package clung to the bottom of the toilet, defying my efforts to move it.\n\nHolding the mop loosely, I stood there, my green tie knotted uncomfortably around my neck, staring at the unpleasant surprise left for the janitorial staff at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more moments of introspection, and my hand moved towards the wall, gripped the toilet paper roll, and began wrapping itself in a makeshift mitten. I straightened up, bent down, and slowly inserted my hand into the bowl, like a parent checking the Thanksgiving turkey in the oven.",
            "Behind the wheel, a ticking time bomb. The alarming statistics of teenager fatalities have raised red flags, and it's not hard to see why. The National Institutes of Health shed light on a crucial aspect of the problem: the teen brain is still developing, making it ill-equipped to handle the risks of driving. Add to this inexperience, and you've got a deadly combination. The simple fact is, inexperienced teens are not only more likely to be involved in fatal accidents but also to be involved in rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road.\n\nAnd let's not forget the company they keep: teens are far more likely to be involved in accidents when they're driving with their friends. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that revealed a sobering correlation between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents. California and other states have introduced provisional licenses to limit the hours teens can drive and restrict passengers under a certain age, but I'm not convinced these measures go far enough.\n\nIn my opinion, the real issue lies in the fact that, as a group, the youngest drivers are statistically unable to handle the risks and responsibilities of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman's research suggests that even 18-year-olds are too young to handle the wheel, citing a common desire among young people to take risks for the thrill of it. It makes sense to delay driving until this tendency to thrill-seek has subsided. If we continue to issue licenses to young teens, we can expect the death toll to skyrocket – and by 2010, the Baby Boomers' offspring will be hitting the roads in droves, further exacerbating the problem.\n\nLegislation to address this issue wouldn't be complicated. Schools could continue to provide driver's education classes, but no one under 18 should be allowed to get behind the wheel. Provisional permits could still be issued, but only after a certain number of hours of practical training – say, the 6 hours and 50 hours of practice with an adult that California currently requires. Uniform national legislation would be a reasonable and effective way to protect teens across the country. And let's be clear: this idea is not new – it's a common-sense approach to a very real problem.",
            "Diving into the Library of Congress's vast collection of early Edison films, I decided to immerse myself in the realm of trick films, a total of fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These early masterpieces rely on creative editing to create illusions, and my film analysis focused on unraveling the poetic underpinnings of the majority of trick films and identifying the evolutionary outliers present in a few of the later ones. The trick films from this era generally adhere to a set of conventions: they're often set-bound, confined within a frontal proscenium, feature static camera angles, and stick to the one shot per film rule. However, a few daring early 20th-century films boldly break free from these rules, introducing innovative techniques like multiple shots.\n\nOne of the most striking features shared by these trick films is their rigid adherence to the frontal proscenium composition. The camera remains stationary, never deviating from its fixed position to follow characters or objects within the frame. This composition is a nod to the theatre and vaudeville traditions, which trick films drew inspiration from, particularly magic acts. The use of a stage as a setting inevitably restricts character movement to side-to-side, rather than forward or backward, as seen in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right and move along the horizontal axis, with the camera remaining steadfast, even as they exit the frame.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style also dictates that shots tend to be long and, occasionally, medium shots. Close-ups are a rarity in these early trick films, as they borrowed from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would witness the entire performance, framed by the borders of the stage. The actors generally remain grounded, never venturing towards the camera, thus rendering close-ups impossible.\n\nMost trick films adhere to the principle that one conceptual shot equals a film, limiting their length to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. This constraint restricts the narrative or dramatic scope of the trick films, which often focus on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearance, and switching acts, with minimal storytelling. However, as revealed in a closer examination of The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a single conceptual shot can be composed of multiple physical shots, expertly joined to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance.",
            "I've always been intrigued by John Taylor of Caroline, a true champion of Republicanism in the early days. As an agriculturalist and politician, he was known for his unwavering dedication to the cause of personal freedom and limited government. His passion for the agrarian way of life was at the heart of his views on governance, shaping his opinions on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the judicial system.\n\nTaylor believed that the United States had a unique opportunity to create a utopian system of government, untainted by traditional influences. This allowed him to envision a self-governing society where the natural rights of individuals were protected and respected. He firmly believed that these rights were interconnected and that denying one would undermine the value of all. These rights should, in his opinion, be beyond the reach of the government.\n\nTaylor argued that the concept of the \"state of nature\" suggested that those with physical strength and malicious intentions were often the ones who profited, but he believed this shouldn't be the case in a civilized society. To create an ideal society, he advocated for a government that acknowledged both the good and evil inherent in humanity. Taylor was unyielding in his conviction that a dualistic morality was essential, stating that governments, as they are shaped by human nature, would inevitably reflect both virtues and vices.\n\nAccording to Taylor, good principles were those that safeguarded private property, promoted agriculture, and discouraged capitalism. He believed a government founded on these principles would function fairly, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by self-interest. While self-interest was a fundamental human motivation, Taylor saw it as a problem only when it led to the creation of sub-societies that exploited others.\n\nA good government, in Taylor's view, was necessary to contain humanity's natural evil, and it must be closely monitored to prevent the introduction of corrupt principles. Like many fellow Republicans of his time, Taylor advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution, with a limited Federal government that only possessed the powers explicitly outlined in the document. He recognized that an expansive government would be costly and potentially tyrannical, but he also believed that a literal interpretation without consideration of the writers' intent could lead to corruption. Furthermore, Taylor considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it more explicitly described the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Going back to the data in Figure 17, we noticed a drastic decline in commuter log submissions during the third month of our project. It was a bit disheartening, and we couldn't quite put our finger on why this was happening. One factor that might have contributed to the decrease was the onset of winter at our New England campus, which tends to decrease the number of people commuting by bike or on foot. Additionally, December is a hectic time for students, with finals and grades to finish, making it easy for the commuter log to fall by the wayside. To make matters worse, December marks the start of the holiday season and a month-long break for students and faculty, leaving many without a reason to come to campus. Classes resumed in late January, but this didn't seem to translate into a significant increase in log submissions. We couldn't help but wonder if our project's initial excitement and momentum had naturally waned, much like a burst of energy that eventually fizzles out. To combat this trend, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a high-energy campaign that actually led to a spike in log submissions that month. However, we still struggled with maintaining project momentum in the face of the inevitable dip in engagement caused by semester breaks and holidays.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges we faced was the fact that people in our culture tend to love the independence and freedom that comes with driving their cars. To incentivize alternative modes of commuting, we offered a range of prizes, including gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, and bookstores. It would have been interesting to see how bigger prizes might have affected participation – perhaps a shiny new bike, a hybrid car, or an electric vehicle would have really gotten people excited and engaged. We stuck with the same prizes throughout the project, but if we had introduced more substantial rewards over time, we might have seen a different outcome. For instance, if we had announced a bicycle giveaway in December and a hybrid car in January, we could have potentially turned the trend around and seen an increase in participation instead of a decline.",
            "Imagine being able to invest in a security that combines the benefits of an index fund with the flexibility of a single stock, without the hefty price tag.  Enter the ETF, or exchange traded fund, a financial instrument designed to track a specific index, commodity, or basket of assets.  While it's true that ETFs offer diversification and the freedom to short sell, buy on margin, and even purchase a single share at a time - much like a traditional stock - they also come with a significantly lower expense ratio compared to the average mutual fund.  However, there are some trade-offs, such as the commission fees associated with buying and selling ETFs, just like stocks.\n\nOn the plus side, ETFs offer a dizzying array of investment options, giving investors a wide range to choose from.  But savvy investors know that it's essential to critically evaluate the benefits of any investment, including diversification, to ensure they truly deliver as promised.  In this analysis, we'll take a closer look at the ETF IHF and its top 10 holdings, which account for a staggering 63.58% of its total assets.  We'll examine whether investing in these top holdings can provide the same benefits as owning a diversified portfolio of the same stocks, and whether there are alternative configurations that could offer an even better return on investment.\n\nTo keep things manageable, we'll focus on the top 10 holdings, leaving out the smaller fish in the pond.  To get a better sense of how these stocks represent the ETF as a whole, we can use their current asset allocation to calculate their individual contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming a portfolio comprised solely of these 10 stocks in the same proportions as the ETF.  The results are enlightening, showing that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could deliver a whopping 16% higher return than the ETF, with a Beta that's a full 0.12 lower.\n\nBut can we be confident in these results?  To find out, we'll dive deeper by calculating the standard deviation of each top 10 stock and comparing it to the ETF's overall standard deviation.  Will our findings be statistically significant, or are they just a fluke?  Stay tuned to find out.",
            "I've often found myself pondering the literary works of Edgar Allan Poe, and 'Dream-Land' stands out as one of his notable poems. Poe himself considered it a personal standout. As I delved into the poem, I came across the term 'Thulé', which is repeated in lines 6 and 56. According to Thomas O. Mabbott, Poe drew inspiration from Virgil's use of the term to describe an island north of Britain, which the ancient Greeks believed marked the edge of the known world. However, there's another, more contemporary source that should be acknowledged - Poe's fascination with German authors.\n\nThis connection is significant because it highlights Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writing. In his book 'Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon', Karl J. Arndt points out the striking similarities between their poems, leading him to conclude that Poe was, in fact, drawing inspiration from Goethe. Interestingly, The Oxford Companion to English Literature notes that Goethe was a celebrated poet and playwright, best known for his masterpiece 'Faust', which was published in two parts - the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe's passing.\n\nWithin the second part of 'Faust' lies a haunting poem, 'The King of Thulé', which tells the tale of a king whose wife passes away after gifting him a goblet. Consumed by grief, the king becomes a heavy drinker and eventually decides to join his beloved queen in death. He leaves his possessions to his children, keeps the goblet as a reminder of his loss, and then takes his own life. The parallels between the King of Thulé and the protagonist of 'Dream-Land' are striking, almost as if Poe was drawing inspiration from Goethe's poem as a way to cope with his own loss and reliance on drink.\n\nIt's worth noting that Goethe's 'Faust' was adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe used the term 'Thule' in 'The Pit and the Pendulum'. Poe referenced Thule twice in his collected works, using 'ultima Thule' in 'The Pit and the Pendulum' and 'Dream-Land' as a repeated refrain. 'The King of Thulé' and 'Dream-Land' can be seen as companion pieces, with Goethe's poem serving as a precursor to Poe's exploration of themes such as loss, loneliness, and a world devoid of color.\n\nGiven Poe's admiration for Tennyson, it's likely that he was familiar with Goethe's work, even if only through reproductions of his writings that were widely available after the original publication. As I see it, Goethe's influence on Poe's poetry is undeniable, a testament to the power of literary connections that transcend time and geography.",
            "Under California law, a customer who slipped and fell on a puddle of applesauce in a grocery store could potentially be awarded punitive damages if they could show that the store manager acted with malice by ignoring a spill, even after being informed twice about it, because he was too busy eating dinner. But would a judge summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages?\n\nUnlikely. To win a punitive damage claim, Palmer would need to provide evidence that the store manager's actions demonstrated a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result, as well as a level of despicability. However, Palmer's case might hold up because she could argue that store manager Paul Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning the spill, given that multiple customers had slipped in similar incidents in the months leading up to her accident, and yet he still chose to do nothing.\n\nPalmer's argument that Martin's actions were despicable is not a slam dunk, but it's not entirely implausible either, especially considering that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred at the store in 2009, and Martin still failed to take adequate measures to ensure customer safety. A lower court decision from 1979, Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., suggests that conduct can be considered malicious if the defendant was aware of the probable consequences of their actions and willfully chose to ignore them.\n\nLet's look at the facts: on October 13, 2009, at 5 pm, an employee, Rick Wayne, informed Martin about the applesauce spill, but Martin claimed he was on dinner break and couldn't deal with it. An hour later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin about the spill, and he responded with the same excuse. It wasn't until 5:30 pm that the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Before her accident, there had been five similar slip-and-fall incidents at the store that year, and Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages. We're considering whether to file a motion to dismiss the punitive damage claim, but based on the facts, it's unlikely that a judge would do so without further review.",
            "It's been almost four years since I took a course in Islam at CBC, and the discussions we had in class still linger in my mind. The question of whether Islam is a hostile religion was a recurring theme. I believe this question has become increasingly relevant over the years, particularly in light of the events since 9/11. It's astonishing to see how the media's perception of Islam has shifted from being hostile to extremely tolerant in America. In 2001, it would have been unthinkable for a presidential candidate with a Muslim background, such as Barack Obama, to run for office.\n\nThe Biography of the Prophet has left me intrigued, as the account of Muhammad's life contradicts my initial understanding of his character. According to the biography, Muhammad is portrayed as a martyr who was often misunderstood and humble, rather than the conqueror I had previously thought. Instead of forcing conversions, people were drawn to his teachings, one by one. This characterization has led me to question the author's intentions, as it seems they're trying to present Muhammad as a gentle and endearing figure.\n\nI've noticed uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' attributed to Muhammad. The most striking example is the story of multiplying food for forty men, which is eerily reminiscent of Jesus' own miracles. This style of writing makes me wonder if the authors are downplaying the true miracle and significance of Jesus' life, essentially borrowing from his story to create a more palatable image of Muhammad.\n\nFurthermore, the biography often presents stories that seem designed to showcase 'witnesses' and conversions to Islam, but these accounts are often third-hand, based on hearsay and unverifiable testimonies. This approach diminishes the credibility of the stories and raises suspicions in my mind.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this work is the attempt to elevate Muhammad to a godly figure, portraying him as humble, wise, and gentle. However, historical records paint a different picture of Muhammad's rise to power, and I can't help but wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true complexities behind his story.",
            "It's striking how quickly the teachings of Jesus were lost in the shuffle as Christianity evolved after his lifetime. Looking back, we can see a clear pattern of Christianity drifting further and further away from its roots. Fast forward to today, and it's clear that there's an increasing awareness and a progressive shift underway. While traditionalists are holding tight to what they've been taught, their numbers might not be enough to sway the masses. In the years to come, Christians will increasingly become aware of the historical context of their faith, and a growing desire to strip away the excesses added to Christianity over time will emerge. It will take time – maybe decades or even centuries – but ultimately, the trend of Christian history will reverse itself. As the clock turns back, people will begin to peel away the layers of doctrine that have accumulated, leaving behind a more authentic representation of the message Jesus brought to humanity on behalf of God. When this shift gains momentum, it will sweep through the United States and Europe, influencing countless people to follow the original teachings of Jesus, unencumbered by centuries of added dogma. The church as an institution will continue to thrive, but its influence will be tempered by a renewed focus on the simplicity and unity of Jesus' message. Instead of the current diversity and fragmentation, we can expect to see more uniformity in Christian thought and practice across different regions, denominations, and divisions. History is full of examples of such reversals – think of how the Roman Empire once persecuted Christians, only to eventually adopt the faith. Similarly, our country has come a long way from slavery to equality. The great reversal that's on the horizon will be a fundamental shift in the Christian faith, one that will take us back to the source and, in the process, simplify and unify the faith. A key factor in this process will be a renewed appreciation for the metaphorical nature of Jesus' words, rather than taking them at face value. So, what happened to the original message of Jesus? By looking back to the early days before Jesus, we find that Judaism was the foundation of the Christian faith. The core components of monotheism, divinely revealed religion, and the authority of Hebrew scripture were already in place by the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. But within Judaism, there was no single, unified spirit – the community was divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a broader group of ordinary Jews.",
            "I believe that The Jungle exposes the harsh reality of human nature, revealing our innate tendency towards self-interest and greed. At our core, we're all about looking out for number one and making our lives as comfortable as possible, without much concern for those beneath us. The Jungle masterfully portrays this through various aspects of the story. The factory owners and managers are prime examples of this self-centeredness. Their sole focus is on expanding their businesses and increasing their wealth, no matter the cost. They show little regard for anything that stands in their way or suffers as a result of their actions. Upton Sinclair's vivid descriptions, such as \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world,\" paint a stark picture of the devastating impact of pollution on the environment. Sinclair highlights the owners' disregard for the well-being of people and animals caught in the crossfire of their pursuit of progress.\n\nThe owners and managers also demonstrate a callous disregard for their employees, who toil tirelessly to fuel their wealth. They're willing to do whatever it takes to save a buck, as Sinclair so poignantly puts it: \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They exploit their workers, forcing them to work grueling hours without notice, and then discard them like so much trash when they're no longer needed. In the era depicted in The Jungle, the lack of laws and regulations protecting workers' rights allowed the owners and managers to run amok, forcing their employees to sacrifice their well-being for the sake of progress. The book implies that those who toiled and died in Packingtown were expected to endure the deplorable conditions, both on the job and in their living environments, without any support or recourse. The absence of organizations or agencies to advocate for workers' welfare only exacerbated the situation, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation. Unions, which were supposed to be a beacon of hope, often proved to be a disappointment, preying on the very people they were supposed to protect. The workers were effectively trapped in a system akin to slavery, with immorality and desperation becoming an inevitable consequence, as Sinclair so starkly puts it: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers.\"",
            "When authors attempt to convey their thoughts and opinions to readers, they often resort to a variety of techniques to achieve the desired effect. Some of these methods are more effective than others, and F. Scott Fitzgerald is a master of using them in his writing. In his iconic novel, The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald employs several of these techniques to shape readers' perceptions of significant themes and characters. One of these techniques is pairing an adjective with a noun in a way that defies convention, evoking a specific atmosphere around a subject. Another approach is assigning meaning to a symbol and then leveraging it to convey a particular emotion or idea. Fitzgerald's use of colors is a prime example of this latter technique, with gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink playing key roles in the novel.\n\nFitzgerald skillfully builds up meaning for the colors white/gray, which he later uses to evoke a sense of uniformity, class, and age in important scenes. At the beginning of the novel, we see the author consistently using both colors to set the tone. For instance, Daisy and Jordan are frequently described as being \"in white,\" and the list of white-clad characters is extensive - Nick dons \"white flannels\" at Gatsby's party, Tom sports a \"white shirt\" when meeting Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white.\" Even everyday objects and settings take on a uniform hue, such as the \"white chasms of lower New York\" Nick navigates on his way to work and the \"gray names\" on his party guest list. This widespread use of white and gray helps to create a sense of monotony and class distinction.\n\nHowever, as the novel progresses, Fitzgerald uses these colors to signify the unimportance or uniformity of certain characters and themes. This shift begins with Daisy, who, after a lull in her appearances, is reintroduced as \"dressed in white\" in a \"little white roadster.\" This portrayal reinforces the notion that Daisy has become a uniform, unremarkable figure in Gatsby's life, rather than a fully fleshed-out character. The use of a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" and her subsequent appearances in a \"white\" dress serve to further underscore this impression, making the reader see her as a mere accessory to Gatsby's desires rather than a fully realized individual.",
            "San Diego County is a gardener's paradise, where the sun shines bright and the harvest is bountiful. The region is home to a wide variety of crops, including the sweet taste of fresh tomatoes, juicy citrus fruits, crisp leafy greens, and an array of squash and broccoli varieties. Herbs, tree fruits, and berries are also in abundance, as well as the golden nectar of honey and the spicy kick of peppers. It's no wonder that the demand for organic community-supported agriculture is high in the area, with many local organizations struggling to keep up with lengthy waiting lists for their fresh produce. Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand, and some farms even offer tours of their operations, allowing visitors to hike, birdwatch, and connect with nature.\n\nThe benefits of organic farming are numerous, but it's not without its challenges. Without relying on chemicals, organic farms require more labor and management to keep pests and weeds under control and the soil fertile. This can lead to higher costs and greater losses, especially for small-scale operations that can't match the efficiency of larger conventional farms. However, the payoff is well worth it, as organic farming promotes biodiversity and creates a healthier environment for both plants and wildlife.\n\nFor a small landowner in the San Diego area, the goal is to find a balance between profitability and environmental sustainability. A 160-acre parcel of land adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California, offers a prime opportunity to do just that. The property features a mix of chaparral, non-native grassland, and oak woodland, and is surrounded by the Cleveland National Forest. The East County Southern Foothills ecoregion is home to over a hundred species of plants and animals, many of which are endangered or declining, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the California gnatcatcher.\n\nThis land has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries and later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. As part of an original homestead patent, the land was likely used for grazing and wood production for many years. Today, a small farmer might seek financial assistance and expertise to mitigate costs and preserve the property's wildlife-friendly operations. I chose a model farm in the same area to demonstrate the possibilities.",
            "In any negotiation, culture plays a pivotal role. But what is culture, really? It's not a fixed entity; it's a dynamic, multifaceted thing that reveals itself through what it encompasses, as much as what it excludes. It's far from homogenous or singular; rather, it's a rich tapestry of complexities and nuances. Reducing a culture to simplistic generalizations – \"Russians are stubborn\" or \"the Japanese are accommodating\" – is a gross oversimplification. While it's essential to grasp a culture's general essence, it's more productive for a negotiator to delve deeper, understanding how that culture's values and attitudes will shape the negotiation process. When we encounter a foreign culture, we inevitably draw comparisons to our own, and this can lead to misunderstandings.\n\nDelving into a culture involves immersing yourself in its history, its prejudices, and its idiosyncrasies. Rather than judging or trying to change it, a negotiator must accept it for what it is and work within its boundaries, especially when the stakes are high or the bargaining position is weak. When operating in unfamiliar territory, a genuine respect for a culture's traditions and values can be a game-changer, helping to bridge cultural divides and propel the negotiation forward.\n\nIt's also essential to recognize that culture isn't solely defined by national or international borders. Corporate culture, for instance, can be a distinct entity within a given nation. A company's emphasis on long work hours or a relaxed schedule, its dress code, communication style, and hiring practices can all reveal its unique culture. Even within the United States, corporate culture can vary significantly from company to company and within regions, highlighting the intricate diversity of thought within a societal culture. What appears uniform or monolithic on the surface can hide a complex web of values and attitudes waiting to be uncovered.\n\nUnderstanding values is crucial, as they provide the underlying motivations of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony is paramount, a negotiator will think twice before publicly embarrassing their company or superior. Conversely, in cultures where a hard-won bargain is prized, negotiators may resist settling for a compromise. By considering these cultural nuances ahead of time, a negotiator can navigate the negotiation table with greater finesse. However, to truly succeed, it's also essential to develop a personal connection with the opposing party, as this can make the negotiation more effective.",
            "We often hear the saying, 'There is no God,' but it's a notion also echoed by the likes of St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas, two thinkers who dedicated their work to proving the existence of a higher power. In this comparison, we'll assume both are correct in their belief in the Christian God, and focus on whose argument is more convincing. To ensure a fair comparison, let's start with the understanding that we're discussing their views on the Christian God specifically.\n\nLooking through the lens of their writings, it becomes apparent that neither St. Anselm nor Thomas Aquinas provides a comprehensive basis for faith. To illustrate this point, let's examine their arguments. St. Anselm's argument revolves around the idea that the existence of God is found within our own understanding, a notion he derived from faith. According to him, we can prove God's existence by looking within ourselves, believing that the concept of God is inherently known to be true. This idea is often referred to as faith, which, by definition, doesn't rely on empirical evidence. In essence, Anselm suggests that we don't need to look elsewhere for truth – it's within our own minds.\n\nIn stark contrast, Thomas Aquinas presents a more traditional and evidence-based approach. He argues that the existence of God can be proven through reason and empirical evidence alone, eliminating the need for faith. This would make it easier to convert new followers, as his arguments are based on logic rather than unproven assumptions. Aquinas lists five logical arguments in support of God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. His core idea is that the proof of God lies in the inherent logic that dictates the existence of a higher power.",
            "It's a story that spans over 2,500 years, one that begins in the ancient times of the 5th or 6th century BCE. A young prince, destined to be known as Buddha, was born, and his life would take a dramatic turn when he renounced the world to find enlightenment. His teachings would shape the foundation of Buddhism, the most traditional branch of which is Theravada Buddhism. Fast forward to the present, and it's clear that the religion has undergone a significant transformation over the centuries. This transformation is evident in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed, a tradition that has little to do with the teachings of Buddha. The fissures between the original teachings and the modern practices run deep, from the surface-level customs to the core principles of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, comprising both monks and lay individuals, has had to adapt its principles over time, influenced by both internal and external forces.\n\nAs we delve into the discussion, it's essential to grasp the nuances of the terms that will be used. An internal force refers to a change driven by the Buddhist community itself, whether monks or laypeople. External forces, on the other hand, originate from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that intentionally harm or seek to damage the community, often driven by a negative perception of Buddhism. Benign forces, while not necessarily beneficial, do not aim to harm and might even inadvertently contribute to the community's growth.\n\nTo gain a deeper understanding of Theravada Buddhism, let's start with the core principles. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma encompasses the Tripitaka, a collection of three baskets of sacred texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka explores the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism, including concepts like Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). By grasping these fundamental ideas, one can break free from Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, and ultimately overcome lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for laypeople, such as the five precepts (do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not engage in misconduct, and do not consume intoxicating substances). For monks, there are additional rules to follow. At the heart of Buddhism lies the four noble truths: Dukkha (life is suffering), attachment causes suffering, and suffering can be overcome.",
            "The long-standing feud between the United States and Mexico, a bitter rivalry that spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893, is a telling example of two nations that couldn't seem to see eye-to-eye. In fact, things came to a head during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, when the United States successfully invaded Mexico, securing Texas and the American Southwest as its new territory (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145). But this wasn't the only clash between the two nations; there were many more skirmishes and power struggles throughout their history, which finally started to subside just before World War I. \n\nWhat set off this rivalry was a clash of fundamental values and interests, particularly when it came to religion, culture, and tradition (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31). Sound familiar? It's a pattern that's repeated in many other nations that share a border with their neighbors. Where lines are drawn, interests collide, and rival positions emerge. The US and Mexico are not unique in this regard; David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that only a handful of nations, including Mexico and Cuba, have been able to sustain long-term diplomatic headaches for the United States (p. 41). Geography plays a significant role in these lasting rivalries, and the proximity of these nations to the US is no coincidence. \n\nOne major point of contention between the two nations was their differing views on religion, a source of discord that has plagued many nations throughout history. As Sally Frahm (2001) points out, in the 18th and 19th centuries, Americans were just as opposed to Catholicism and monarchies as they were to fascism and communism in the 20th century (p. 86). The ideological struggles between the US and Mexico were akin to the Cold War's East-West standoff, but with a twist - instead of a battle between politics, it was a clash of faiths. This underlying distrust was inherited from their former colonial rulers, the English and Spanish, making it a major hurdle to establishing a harmonious relationship between the two nations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) catalogued an astonishing 17 disputes between Mexico and the US during this 57-year period, with the majority of these conflicts centered around territorial issues and border raids from Mexican territory. The violence and lawlessness on both sides of the border were a persistent problem that wasn't fully resolved until both countries exerted military force to maintain order (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97).\n\nIt wasn't until Mexico became increasingly dependent on the US that the rivalry began to fade, and by the late 19th century, American ambitions had shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico, effectively ending the bitter rivalry (Schmitt, 1974, p. 109-110).",
            "It's been fifteen long years since I was unexpectedly laid low by a mysterious illness that I never saw coming. At the time, I was a nurse, having chosen that career path because it seemed like a safe and secure way to make a living. I'd often heard the same mantra growing up: \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\" While I had bigger dreams - I longed to be a scientist or a journalist - this was the path I took. \n\nNow, at 46 and single, with no savings to speak of, I've been living on disability benefits for over a decade. I'm still struggling to get by, with every passing day feeling like an exhausting battle for my security, safety, and self-worth. The thought of uncertainty looms over me, yet I'm reminded of a hard-won truth: without the unwavering support of my family and a few kind friends, I wouldn't have made it this far. When disaster strikes, it's easy to feel overwhelmed, and I know I'm not alone in that feeling.\n\nMy point is this: no matter how prepared you are, life's emergencies - big and small - are inevitable. There are no guarantees, and some challenges are just too great to face alone.\n\nWhile I agree that we should be cautious about relying too heavily on the government, I firmly believe that we'd be better off fostering a culture of mutual support and trust. Rather than each of us going it alone, we should be learning to rely on one another and ask for help when we need it.\n\nThe conservatives in the US often romanticize the idea of rugged individualism that supposedly built this country, but the truth is that our forebears relied on compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources to get through tough times. Those pioneers who trekked across the Rocky Mountains didn't make it to the coast without the help of their fellow travelers.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I've got my disaster kit, first aid supplies, and a stash of emergency supplies. If you have the means, consider growing your own food or investing in a wood stove. But don't forget the most important thing: get to know your neighbors, and be willing to lend a hand (or ask for one) when you need it.",
            "The age-old question remains: why do organisms evolve the way they do? Are there any boundaries or constraints that dictate the direction of evolutionary change? It's a mystery that has puzzled scientists for over a century – even the renowned biologist D'Arcy Thompson noted in 1917 that \"even now, the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms.\" Yet, despite the passage of time, we still don't have a clear answer.\n\nRecently, however, scientists have started to use mathematical modeling to better understand the intricate dance of evolutionary change in organisms. One group of researchers, for instance, has applied mathematical modeling to the development of mollusk shells, examining both their growth patterns and evolutionary history (Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our own study is taking a similar approach, combining mathematical modeling with experimental research to uncover the underlying mechanisms that drive evolutionary change in the snail genus Prunum.\n\nWe used X-ray images of Prunum species to identify key characteristics that can be used to model hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. These parameters were then fed into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995), allowing us to create virtual shell shapes that can be used to explore the boundaries of possible morphological change.\n\nIn essence, a shell can be thought of as a spiral tube that grows over time, with each coil or whorl representing a specific point in the organism's life history. The central axis of the shell, known as the columella, runs through its center, and each whorl is separated by a continuous line called a suture. The speed at which these whorls grow can vary, and the largest whorl is typically the last one (the body whorl).\n\nWhen examining a shell, we can view it from different angles: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The most common orientation is apertural, where the opening of the shell faces the viewer, with the tip of the spire pointing upwards.\n\nTo count the whorls, we start by viewing the shell from the apical angle and identifying the first suture. We then draw a line dividing the shell into two parts, and count the whorls from this line, estimating each one to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can also be seen as a series of openings that move through time and space as the organism builds its shell. By tracking the coordinates of each whorl's aperture, as well as its horizontal and vertical radius, we can create a mathematical representation of the shell's growth trajectory.

            "We've been staring at some disturbing statistics for a decade, and it's time we take a closer look. Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have been stuck in a rut for the past ten years, and while the country is inching towards meeting some of the Millennium Development Goals, progress in child and maternal health is woefully off track. The harsh reality is that the country's approach needs a serious overhaul – it's time to shift focus from program-specific fixes to strengthening the health system as a whole. \n\nIndonesia's made some headway in getting skilled health workers present during births, with 72% of births now meeting this standard. But don't be fooled – this figure includes traditional midwives who can't provide medical interventions when complications arise, leading to a disproportionate number of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage. What's more, the percentage of children under five treated for diarrheal cases has taken a hit, and postnatal care is a dark area where data is scarce, with low rates across the country.\n\nThe alarming low rate of cesarean sections, at around 4%, points to a deeper issue. The rate is 7% in urban areas, but a mere 2% in rural regions, highlighting the glaring disparities in healthcare access. It's clear that urban areas are getting the lion's share of healthcare services, leaving rural communities in the dust. The issue of vertical equity further exacerbates the problem, with a staggering 27% gap between the poorest and richest quintiles – the poor are finding it nearly impossible to access healthcare due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nSo, what's next for Indonesia? The most pressing question is how to address the glaring lack of access to healthcare services. Should the country focus on program-specific approaches or take a more holistic approach to strengthening the health system? While targeted, vertically-oriented programs have their appeal, they come with significant drawbacks. For one, investing heavily in one area often means neglecting others, and human resources get sucked into areas with more funding. Furthermore, running multiple parallel programs leads to duplication and disorganization, resulting in a logistical nightmare.",
            "Victorian novels are characterized by an intense focus on the intricacies of the upper class during that era. However, two notable exceptions are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  These novels deviate from the norm by incorporating elements of mystery and the bizarre, which serves to deepen our understanding of the characters' motivations and emotions. This unique approach allows readers to gain a more profound insight into the inner workings of their minds.\n\nAs Oliver Twist navigated the treacherous world of Victorian London, his mind became a jumble of confusing and bewildering thoughts. He found himself lost in a haze of hallucinations, reliving fragments of his past and struggling to distinguish reality from fantasy. In one particularly vivid sequence, the sound of gunfire shattered the silence, and Oliver was swept away by an unseen force. His senses were overwhelmed, and he was left reeling from the pain and fear that seemed to have become an integral part of his existence.\n\nThis use of dreamlike states in Oliver Twist serves to highlight Oliver's feelings of powerlessness and despair. His inability to control the events that unfolded around him is a refrain that echoes throughout the novel. The shooting itself becomes a symbol of the hopelessness that has consumed Oliver, a reminder that he is a pawn in a much larger game. His lack of agency is further underscored by his inability to react, even when his very life is at stake. It is as if Fagin's influence has worn him down, leaving him a broken and defeated individual.\n\nIn Wuthering Heights, the dreamlike sequences take on a different form. The passage describing the long and sleepless night that followed the tumultuous events of the day is a testament to the author's ability to craft a sense of atmosphere and mood. The words \"day\" and \"night\" become interchangeable, blurring the lines between reality and fantasy. This sense of disorientation serves to underscore the characters' emotional states, which are as turbulent as the weather that surrounds them.",
            "It's a memory that still sticks out in my mind - working in an after-school program, trying to help elementary-age students with their studies. I did my best to assist them in areas where they needed improvement, but my strengths lay in English and reading. However, one student in particular - a boy named Adrian, whom I believe was in the third or fourth grade at the time - proved to be a puzzle. He was having trouble reading, but what struck me as odd was the way he struggled with certain letters, while others seemed to come easily to him. His fluency in English was impressive, considering I suspected he was of Latino descent. \n\nAs I worked with him, it became increasingly clear that something was amiss. We made little progress until the day his mother walked in, speaking only Spanish. With my limited Spanish skills, we managed to communicate, and I had a revelation: Adrian could read just fine, but he was struggling with the English alphabet. I'm not sure how much this insight helped him in the long run, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the issue of the language barrier in schools, especially in California. It's not always as straightforward as we might think, even for students who speak perfect English. Reading can be a significant obstacle, and I'm sure everyone agrees that this is a problem. So, what's the solution? For Adrian, it was as simple as extra tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for students who barely speak English, the answer is much more complex.\n\nThere's no one-size-fits-all solution to this problem. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes - none of these approaches can fix the issue on their own. The key lies in combining them all. \n\nFirstly, the dual language system is a great concept, not just for children who speak Spanish as their first language, but for all students. Research has shown that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Many people fear that these programs are a waste of resources, claiming that the majority of students won't benefit. But that's just not true. If we implemented these programs as the norm, rather than the exception, all students would benefit. So, how do we make this work? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? No, that's unrealistic. But I do think it's reasonable to have bilingual assistants, tutors, or whatever you want to call them, to support our teachers.",
            "As we grow up, many of us are told that there's something greater than ourselves out there, something beyond our understanding. Some of us attend Sunday school, while others seek answers in temples or within their own minds. Many of us adopt the faith handed down to us by our parents, but others reject it entirely, believing that there's only what we can grasp within our own egocentric world. Our values can shift over time, and we may go on to find new meaning in different spiritual paths. We're on a journey to discover ourselves through our own unique perspectives on the mysteries of existence and to find a guiding light in the darkness.\n\nI still remember a conversation I had with my dad about his favorite type of bird – the cardinal. We sat on our front porch, listening to the rain drumming on the tin roof as we both smoked our cigarettes. The rain poured down from the gutters, drowning the plants on the edge of the porch. My dad gazed out into the rain, his expression a mix of searching and remembering. He'd lost weight and his clothes hung loosely on his frail body. His hair had thinned out, too. I sensed his pain and my own fear as we sat there in silence. I felt a lump in my throat, unable to bring up the topic of how much I'd miss him – talking about it would only make it more real for both of us. I hugged him, moved my chair closer to his, and sat down beside him, both of us lost in the rain's rhythmic beat.\n\nMy dad passed away that December, just five days after my 22nd birthday. The chemotherapy and radiation had prolonged his life beyond the doctors' predictions, but it was a hollow extension – what was the value in mere survival when he suffered so much? I remember questioning a God who would allow this. Alone at night, I didn't say any prayers. If God existed, I thought, he'd stopped listening to me a long time ago.\n\nI didn't want to witness my dad's passing, so I didn't. I couldn't watch the man who'd given me life slip away. I chose to remember him by how he lived, not how he died. I knew my dad better than anyone else; I knew he wouldn't have wanted me to be a spectator at his death. For three days, I curled up in bed, waiting for the news. But no one even called me.",
            "I've always thought that the term \"Gothic Novel\" is a perfect oxymoron - \"old\" and \"new\" all wrapped into one. As Ian Watt so aptly puts it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, this genre is a paradox that has been met with both disdain and adoration. Some have dismissed it as lacking substance, while others have praised it for evoking the 'terrible sublime' (a concept Burke explored). The roots of the Gothic genre date back to Horace Walpole's novel, The Castle of Otranto, which cleverly merged elements from both ancient and modern romances to create something entirely new. By combining the old theatrical flair of medieval gothic theatre with the modern novel's ability to delve into character psychology, Walpole managed to craft a style that would endure for centuries, despite being both obsolete and innovative at the same time.\n\nOne of the key elements that defines the Gothic genre is the concept of chivalry. In the medieval era, chivalry represented the epitome of knighthood - bravery, honor, and competence. However, as Walpole and other Gothic writers saw it, this ideal had largely disappeared from modern society. In his novel, The Castle of Otranto, Walpole romanticized the gothic past, using chivalric concepts to critique the present. This was particularly relevant given the tumultuous times in which he wrote - a period marked by political upheaval and unfair accusations. Walpole's character, Frederic, is a prime example of this idealized chivalry. Described as a prince who has suffered greatly, he embodies the traditional chivalric traits - courtesy, gallantry, and a sense of justice. However, his portrayal is also exaggerated, introducing the concept of excess that would become a staple of the Gothic genre.",
            "I still remember the early 80s when the concept of supply chain management burst onto the scene, revolutionizing the way goods moved from raw materials to customer satisfaction. Keith Oliver, a visionary consultant, coined the term in 1982, and it has been a game-changer ever since. He described the intricate process of planning, implementing, and controlling the supply chain to deliver what customers want, quickly and efficiently. The supply chain is a complex web of six interconnected elements: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Savvy business managers master these elements to provide top-notch customer service.\n\nProduction is the foundation of the supply chain, where everything begins. It's the when, why, where, and how of production, setting the stage for the entire process. To get it right, managers need to tap into customer demand, and the market is the best barometer for that. By analyzing market trends and customer needs, managers can decide what products to produce, in what quantities, and where to produce them – all while keeping customer satisfaction top of mind. It's a delicate balance, but one that's crucial to success. I should know; I've seen it firsthand in my previous stints at retail heavyweights like Wal-Mart and Target. These companies have meticulous processes in place, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments from trucks. It's a well-oiled machine that hums along smoothly when every detail is planned to perfection.\n\nThe supply element is another key cog in the supply chain machine. It's all about making strategic decisions about your core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. A company might have multiple divisions for a single product, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers must choose which division is the best fit for each process, and sometimes, that means outsourcing to other companies. The goal is to create velocity – delivering high-quality products with flexibility and keeping costs low.",
            "There's a jarring message scrawled on a cardboard sign held aloft by Ellen Page, a Juno actress, on a city street corner. The somber words, scribbled with a Sharpie, declare: 'Hitler is alive in Burma'. Burma, or Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation plagued by a ruthless military dictatorship that seized power in 1962 through a bloody coup d'état. In 2007, a wave of street protests erupted, the first public demonstrations in over a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests were dubbed 'The Saffron Revolution' after the color of their traditional robes. As the public's interest in the protests grew, the Burmese government initially allowed the monks to gather peacefully, but the situation soon escalated into a brutal conflict between the monks and the military junta, with the military invading and ransacking monasteries across the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned, and a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was tragically killed on September 27, 2007, simply for witnessing a street protest. While the official death toll is reported to be 13, Colonel Hla Win, a former army defector, alleged that many more people were killed, with the bodies numbering in the thousands.\n\nThis is nothing new. A government's insatiable desire to suppress dissent and maintain total control over its citizens has been a recurring theme throughout human history. Ancient Roman emperors claimed divine right to absolute power over every aspect of their society. In Japan, emperors are still revered as deities, sent to lead their people to prosperity through innovation and self-discipline. Our current president, George W. Bush, reportedly held regular conference calls with Ted Haggard, a prominent Christian leader, who was once at the helm of Stupid People Worldwide, a fringe organization with ties to the Republican Party.\n\nSome of the most shocking examples of these actions include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where students, intellectuals, and labor activists gathered to challenge the authoritarian rule of the Chinese government. The death toll from that event varies wildly, with official reports ranging from 200-300 to reports from the Chinese Red Cross, which estimated between 2,000-3,000 dead. Another harrowing example is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, backed by the Rwandan government, systematically targeted and killed Tutsis and political moderates, regardless of their ethnic backgrounds. The atrocities committed during Hitler's 'Third Reich' are another extreme example of a government's brutal suppression of dissent and minority groups.",
            "Duke Ellington's timeless contribution to jazz is largely due to his remarkable longevity and, by extension, his boundless creativity in shaping his orchestra. Though his piano presence is understated in many of the compositions featured here, Ellington excelled as a composer by crafting rich, intricate pieces that showcased the distinct talents of his band members. He skillfully created a framework where soloists could improvise freely, while also writing tightly orchestrated sections that highlighted the unique styles of individual musicians. This approach not only allowed him to emphasize the overall tone of the orchestra but also resulted in coherent and original sounds that perfectly suited each piece. Ellington's mastery of the individual players' voices and how they blended together in a growing ensemble enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative approach to sound and his use of voice as a jazz instrument in his long career, citing Creole Love Call as a prime example. This early piece showcases Ellington's ability to incorporate voice without lyrics, adding texture and depth to the music. The song's twelve-bar blues structure, featuring six distinct choruses, demonstrates Ellington's skill in complementing the style of his soloists. The choruses unfold as follows:\n\nChorus 1: A call-and-response exchange between voice and reeds, with the voice beginning smooth and melodic before transitioning to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo elaborates on the basic melody, emphasizing several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus, with a call-and-response between the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus, as the reeds initiate the call-and-response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call-and-response between voice and reeds. In this final chorus, the voice takes on the sound of the \"growl\" technique, soloing as an instrument.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to his music is a hallmark of his style. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, he combines his skill in tight orchestration with his ear for tone color, creating a rich and complementary sound through a call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "For as long as she could remember, there was a gnawing sense of discontent within her. This hollowness refused to be filled, lingering since her early teenage years. By the time she was 17, it had become a persistent ache that wouldn't subside. She began to realize that what she craved wasn't a thing, but a connection – a human connection that eluded her. Yet, she found herself unresponsive to the boys who showed interest, leaving her puzzled about what was missing. She often found herself questioning her own desires, searching for answers that seemed to evade her, even as the years went by. Theories emerged, but none provided a satisfactory explanation for this peculiar phenomenon.\n\nHer home life was usually a serene bubble. Her parents were calm and peaceful, rarely arguing with each other. When they did have disagreements, they were usually with her, stemming from their desire to let her spread her wings and be her free-spirited self. They balanced each other out, but she added her own unique energy to the mix – a lively, lovable, and kind-hearted individual who brought warmth to those around her.\n\nHowever, today was different. As she wandered from room to room, seeking inspiration, the sound of her mother's distressed cry pierced the air from the kitchen. She rushed in, panic setting in as she frantically asked, \"Mom, what's wrong?!\" Her mother lay on the ground, wincing in pain, repeating \"Ow\" in short, labored gasps. Her daughter rushed to her side, placing a supporting hand on her mother's shoulder. \"Ouch... sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital,\" her mother managed to say, her words strained and urgent. The daughter sprang into action, grateful for the strength she'd gained from prior training, as she carefully lifted her mother and helped her to the car.\n\nThe hospital's antiseptic scent and eerie atmosphere hung in the air, weighed down by an undercurrent of fear. Yet, her focus remained on her mother's well-being as she quickly guided her into a treatment room and called for medical help. The doctors and nurses rushed in, and soon her mother was being tended to, while she sat anxiously waiting.\n\nIt turned out her mother had taken a tumble off a stool while trying to retrieve a vase from the top cabinet.",
            "I've always been fascinated by the profound impact of diet on our well-being, particularly when it comes to the Mediterranean diet, also known as \"Med diet.\" This study aimed to uncover the relationship between adherence to a modified version of the Med diet, dubbed the \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet,\" and the risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke. The aMed diet is characterized by a higher intake of plant-based foods, monounsaturated fats, and fish, alongside a lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate amounts of alcohol are also allowed.\n\nPast studies have demonstrated a clear inverse correlation between adherence to the Med diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. Another study showed that the Med diet outperformed a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. However, previous research has focused primarily on mortality and weight loss, leaving the relationship between the Med diet and stroke or stroke mortality largely unexplored.\n\nThis study followed a staggering 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study that observes 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Over the course of 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, the researchers computed an aMed diet score six times, using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" that gauged nutrient intake over the preceding year. An impressive 95% of the nurses remained part of the study throughout this period. The questionnaires were validated through medical and hospital records, autopsy reports, and death certificates. For cases where records were unavailable, \"probable\" cases were included, accounting for around 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts.\n\nTo minimize random variation and better capture long-term dietary intake, the researchers calculated cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated questionnaires. They also adjusted for potential confounders, such as age, smoking status, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing Cox proportional-hazard modeling, the researchers examined the association between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, with separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. The results showed that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was linked to a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. During the 20-year follow-up period, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were identified. Women in the top aMed quintile were at a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "It's hard to believe it's been over a decade since the United States was rocked by a devastating financial crisis. The job market was decimated, the housing market imploded, and some of the country's biggest and most influential corporations were left reeling. As we look back, it's time to ask the tough questions: what led to this disaster, and how can we prevent it from happening again? In a nutshell, the crisis was a direct result of reckless and naive decision-making by politicians who put pressure on banks and financial institutions to issue sub-prime loans into a fragile and underdeveloped financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac got caught up in the chaos, forced to buy and repackage these dodgy mortgages into complex financial instruments like CDOs and CDSs. When homebuyers defaulted on these loans, the banks were left with huge losses, which they then passed on to the rest of the economy.\n\nLooking back, the roots of the financial crisis lay in the late 1990s, when President Clinton was looking to secure a second term in office. To boost his popularity, his administration relaxed lending regulations, setting the stage for the sub-prime disaster that would unfold seven years later. Stephen Holmes of the New York Times sounded the alarm in 1999, warning that Fannie Mae was under pressure to expand mortgage lending to low-income borrowers and maintain its profits. He foresaw the consequences of this reckless approach: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As we now know, ill-advised lending would ultimately lead to an economic meltdown.\n\nA perfect storm of factors contributed to the economic collapse, including the proliferation of complex mortgage products like adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These instruments tied more and more sectors of the economy to the housing market, leaving households and financial markets overexposed and vulnerable to even minor changes in the housing market. When the housing bubble burst, the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were left reeling. The five biggest U.S. investment banks reported a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, equivalent to about 30% of the country's GDP. In the end, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at fire-sale prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to transform into commercial banks subject to tough regulations. Fannie and Freddie were saddled with $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were taken under government control in September 2008.",
            "The pitfalls of exposition - that great expanse of narrative where the unwary writer's wings can falter, leaving readers yawning and scrambling for the \"Back\" button.  Dr. Merlin has been known to let out a frustrated cry at her screen when she finds herself bogged down in a sea of unnecessary detail. Exposition can be a necessary evil, but it's not exactly the most exciting part of writing.\n\nEven seasoned authors like Dr. Merlin often struggle with the temptation to dump too much information on their readers, forgetting the cardinal rule: \"Show, don't tell.\"  The goal is to engage, not to lecture or recite a laundry list of facts. Exposition is like that pesky little voice in your head that says, \"Let's get this over with, so we can get to the good stuff.\" But what's the \"good stuff\" if not a rich tapestry of characters, plot, and emotion?\n\nTake, for instance, a scenario where a writer tells us that a heroine met her beloved at a certain time and place, got married in a grand ceremony, and then had her husband brutally murdered in front of her eyes.  Would it be wise to spend two pages on this sequence, with nary a word of dialogue between the two?  Probably not.  Instead, the author should take the time to flesh out the husband's character - his words, his mannerisms, the way he loves his wife.  We should see the heroine's transformation, her growth, her dependence on him.  By doing so, we become invested in their relationship, their fate, and the heroine's emotional journey.\n\nIn short, we crave more than just the bare bones of a storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"  We want the meat that makes it real, that makes us care.  So, as writers, let's resist the urge to speed through the exposition and focus on crafting a narrative that truly comes alive.",
            "I caught two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was NBC 4, live this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was a disturbing one about a man in Ashley, Ohio who'd stabbed his wife. The news team didn't reveal her name, but showed a mugshot of the perpetrator, Shad Hostettler. He looked every bit the part of a malevolent figure. The report was concise, lasting only about two minutes, as the story was still unfolding. I thought they gave it enough airtime.\n\nThe next story I saw was about an 18-year-old named Travis Buyers, who'd been shot in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically injured but no arrests had been made. The SWAT Team was on the case. This particular story seemed short-lived, and I suspect it might have been due to the fact that the victim and the neighborhood were from a minority background. I've noticed for years that crimes committed against minorities often get glossed over, while the media goes into frenzy when a white victim is involved.\n\nThe news cycle then shifted to a story about a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. They provided details about where the incident likely occurred and revealed that a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle was to blame. Crime-Stoppers was offering a substantial reward for any information leading to the shooter's capture.\n\nNext up was a brief report about the impending rain and thunderstorms forecasted for Saturday afternoon. The temperature was expected to remain steady in the mid to low eighties for the weekend, but they seemed to be teasing the story rather than providing a thorough update.\n\nThey also ran with a story about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The perpetrator was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie and standing about six feet tall and weighing 150 pounds. I was struck by how much emphasis was placed on his skin color and the fact that he was dark-skinned. It seemed an unusual amount of time was dedicated to these unnecessary details.\n\nAnother story featured Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin, who'd been found guilty of conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. I was puzzled by the way his sentence was reported - instead of saying he was sentenced to 25 years in prison, they said \"300 months.\" I'm not sure if they thought this phrasing sounded harsher or if it was just a quirk. They also highlighted his Hispanic heritage, but I'm not convinced it was relevant to the story.",
            "The connection between brothers is a complex and unbreakable one, woven with threads of love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. It's a bond that transcends words and understanding, one that can only be truly grasped by those who have experienced it firsthand. Brothers have a unique ability to see themselves reflected in one another, a characteristic that becomes starkly apparent in the most trying of times. Whether the emotions that arise from this bond are positive or negative, they come with a steep price. To truly comprehend the intricacies of fraternal love, one must confront the consequences that come with it. Looking into the eyes of a brother is like gazing into a mirror, revealing a person's true nature, beyond the façade that others may see. It's in their actions and the aftermath of those actions that a person's character is truly revealed. \n\nIn James Hurst's poignant tale, \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" this theme is masterfully explored through the complex relationships between two brothers. Against the backdrop of a lush, vividly described landscape, their journey unfolds as a poignant exploration of the messy emotions that accompany brotherhood. Bitter disappointment and intense pride collide in a heart-wrenching climax, resulting in a sobering conclusion that leaves only one brother standing. The narrative weaves together a nuanced portrait of the protagonist and his younger brother, Doodle, whose fragile existence is marked by a weak heart that renders him unsuitable for the physical pursuits that the older brother had envisioned for them. The older brother's desire for a companion to share in his adventures is met with crushing disappointment, leading him to harbor feelings of resentment towards his sibling. His anger is almost palpable, as he recalls contemplating the unthinkable – suffocating Doodle with a pillow. However, a single, radiant smile from his brother is enough to melt his resolve, revealing a glimmer of the love that lies beneath his surface. This tender moment suggests that his capacity for cruelty may not be as strong as he initially thought. Throughout the narrative, the reader is left to ponder the complexities of brotherly love and the far-reaching consequences that it entails.",
            "We've all seen the incredible complexity of the human brain. As technology has advanced, so have the metaphors we use to describe it. From the primitive wax tablet to the modern computer, our understanding of the brain has evolved significantly. However, it's essential to remember that these metaphors have their limitations and can lead to misconceptions.\n\nWhen sensory information enters our brains, it's like a puzzle, with our sensory organs transforming physical stimuli into electrochemical signals. The brain's algorithms process this information in layers, both from the bottom up and from the top down. For instance, when gazing at a picture of a black box on a white background, the brain's bottom-up processing starts by identifying the colors, orientation, and borders of the object, ultimately concluding that you're looking at a box. Meanwhile, top-down processing uses the decisions made at earlier stages to speed up your recognition, determining whether you're looking at a box or a hole in the background.\n\nOnce the brain has processed the information to a certain degree, an attention filter kicks in to determine which signals are most important and which cognitive processes should be engaged. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. On the other hand, you might pick out your name even in a noisy room.\n\nThe brain's processing is a multi-stage process, with results modulated by attention at each stage. For information to be processed, it must first be stored in the brain. There are various types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. When information is first stored, it's encoded in a specific way, depending on the type of sensory input. For instance, verbal input can be encoded based on its appearance, sound, or meaning.\n\nOnce information is stored, it must be maintained. Research suggests that working memory, which stores information for about 20 seconds, relies on an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period. Long-term memory, on the other hand, is thought to be maintained through the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are numerous models of how knowledge is organized in the brain, ranging from how humans retrieve memories to computer science and neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that there are nodes representing concepts, linked based on their relatedness. For example, in this model, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley paints a chilling picture of a dystopian world in his novel Brave New World, where technology and capitalism are intertwined to create a society where the individual is subjugated to the collective. The people of this world value community above all else, and from a very young age, they're conditioned to prioritize instant gratification. The citizens of this world are mere pawns in a grand game, forced to adhere to a single ideology dictated by the World Controller. Examining Huxley's work through the lens of Marxist theory reveals a deep-seated distrust of the systems he saw emerging around him. Key Marxist concepts like homogeny and reification abound, solidifying the notion that Brave New World is a scathing critique of the economic system of his time.\n\nThe capitalist machinery is cleverly satirized by Huxley through the concept of false consciousness. The average citizen is oblivious to the true nature of their economic relationships with other classes, consumed instead by their own self-interest. This is achieved through the ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, a phenomenon that's starkly evident in the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The lower classes, categorized as Deltas and Gammas, lack any genuine sense of self-determination; hypnopædia is used to fuel their desire to consume and indulge above all else. This manipulation is orchestrated by the World Controller, demonstrating the grip of hegemony – the idea that dominant social groups control and dominate others.\n\nThe lower classes are unwittingly complicit in this system, mindlessly buying into an ideology that sustains it. Meanwhile, the upper classes, like the Alphas and Betas, are cognizant of the manipulation but choose to do nothing, perpetuating the status quo. The interactions between characters in Brave New World are superficial, devoid of genuine relationships and depth. Huxley may be suggesting that the union of technology and capitalism extinguishes humanity's capacity for free will and self-expression. The absence of true love and deep emotions is evident in the shallow conversations between characters, often revolving around physical appearance and surface-level interactions. The complacency of each social class within their designated hierarchy is a telling indicator of the insidious effects of capitalism on the proletariat, as they're led to believe their superiority is tied to their ability to conform and consume.",
            "I've been a student here at University Park for nearly three years now - roughly four and a half semesters. As a student, I'm not alone in my struggles to navigate this sprawling campus. My freshman year, I was stuck in an East Halls dorm room, on the far eastern edge of campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in buildings like Willard, which are centrally located, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially when the weather turns gloomy, which it often does in State College.  I had a chance conversation with an alum not much older than me, and it turned out that not so long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the campus by massive empty tracts of land. Fast forward to today, and that vacant space has been filled in with sports fields, brand-new buildings, and a series of apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another is becoming increasingly difficult. So, what's the solution to this mobility conundrum? On a college campus, the answer is clear: the humble bicycle. But having a bike is just the starting point. Students need to ride them regularly, and the campus needs to be designed with cyclists in mind.\n\nI recently caught up with a friend who's recently dusted off his bike after a few years away from cycling. He mused to me, \"Bikes are great - for a few years it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Not only is cycling good for your physical health, it's also the most efficient mode of transportation. With a bowl of oatmeal and some physical exertion, you can cover 30 miles or more. As an off-campus resident, just like many of my peers, I've made the smart decision to buy a bike this year. With classes in Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my home, I can significantly cut down that time to just 5 minutes if I pedal hard enough. The only catch is, Pollock Road is the most direct route to Thomas building from my house, but it's not always easy to navigate, bike or otherwise. I'm not a fan of walking, so having a bike has been a lifesaver. If I didn't have my trusty bike, I'd have to rely on walking, which would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That's over two and a half hours every week. When you factor in the time I'd need to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and so on, it's a staggering amount of time I just can't spare."
