            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

I'm drawn to the Division of Family and Children Services, where I can make a real difference in the lives of kids who've been dealt a tough hand. I'd like to support families in crisis and help them navigate the darkest of times. My values align with this field in a big way: service, respect, and a strong sense of ethics are non-negotiables for me. I'm also committed to helping others, whether it's building strong relationships within families or pushing myself to stay ahead of the curve in this ever-evolving field.\n\nLooking back, I've always wanted to use my skills to help others, but I wasn't sure where to start. Throughout high school and college, I saw people dodging their problems and coping in not-so-ideal ways. That's why I pursued a degree in Psychology, hoping it would be a step in the right direction. Even after graduation from Piedmont College in 2009, I remained unsure of my path. But everything changed on a summer day when a friend introduced me to a 16-year-old kid who was desperate to escape his abusive parents. I listened to his story and, the next day, I went to the police to share my concerns and offer my support. It was a turning point for me – I realized I wanted to dedicate my career to helping kids like him who are caught in the crossfire of family conflicts.\n\nSocial justice is another value that drives me.

            "Insomnia: A Multifaceted Disorder at the Convergence of Biology and Culture\n\nThis paper delves into the complex world of insomnia, a sleep disorder that has been extensively studied through the lenses of both biological and sociocultural models. The biological model focuses on the genetic and physiological underpinnings of insomnia, while the sociocultural model examines the environmental and social factors that contribute to the disorder. This review aims to explore the relationship between these two models, highlighting the key research findings and their implications for understanding insomnia.\n\nInsomnia can manifest in various forms, including primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders linked to mental health issues, and sleep disorders caused by medical complications or substance intake. The primary sleep disorders include Dyssonmias, such as Primary Insomnia and Primary Hypersomnia, as well as Parasomnias, which involve behavioral abnormalities and physiological occurrences during sleep. In this review, we will focus primarily on insomnia and, to some extent, on the broader category of primary sleep disorders.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes the role of genetics, heritable factors, and physiological mechanisms in the development of insomnia. Research has shown that neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice found that the presence of phenotypic GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons is essential for sleep-wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while its inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and increased sleep. The GABAB agonist, baclofen, has been shown to increase sleep time in mice, suggesting a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. This finding implies that alterations in this receptor could impact an individual's ability to achieve adequate sleep without medication, with potential consequences for daily life, including academic, professional, and mundane tasks.\n\nThe sociocultural implications of this study are significant, as the inheritance of this phenotype could regulate sleep patterns and an alteration of the receptor could naturally disrupt sleep. This, in turn, could negatively impact various aspects of life, including school, career, and daily events that require sustained focus and attention. By examining the intersection of biology and culture, we gain a deeper understanding of the complex factors contributing to insomnia and its far-reaching consequences.",
            "The following is a comprehensive overview of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), a condition that has quietly wreaked havoc on the lives of many. To begin, let's define CAPD. Simply put, it's a disorder where the central nervous system, the command center of our being, has trouble processing auditory information. Don't get me wrong – people with CAPD can hear just fine; it's just that their brain has a hard time making sense of what they hear. Imagine trying to tune into your favorite radio station, only to have the static overwhelm the music – that's essentially what's happening in the brains of those with CAPD. \n\nThe history of CAPD dates back to the 1950s, when researchers first started studying children with communication disorders. The term \"auditory imperception\" was coined back then, and since then, we've made significant progress in understanding this complex condition. In the 1960s, scientists like Kimura made groundbreaking discoveries about the way our brains process sound, paving the way for the development of tests that could help diagnose CAPD.\n\nSo, what does CAPD look like in real life? It can manifest in a variety of ways, from difficulty localizing sounds to trouble distinguishing between different speech patterns. For example, someone with CAPD might struggle to pick up on sarcasm or have trouble following a conversation in a noisy environment. It's like trying to decipher a code that's constantly shifting. Other signs include trouble filtering out background noise or distinguishing between multiple sounds at the same time.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD is no simple task. It requires a comprehensive evaluation, often involving a team of experts, including audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists. They'll use a range of tests to assess auditory skills, including behavioral observations and questionnaires. There's no single \"magic test\" that can diagnose CAPD, and the exact cause remains a mystery. However, by understanding the complexities of CAPD, we can better support those affected and help them navigate a world that's often overwhelming.\n\nAs a teacher in a mainstream classroom, what can you do to help a student with CAPD thrive? It's all about creating a supportive environment that acknowledges their unique needs. By being aware of the challenges they face and making a few simple adjustments, you can help level the playing field. It's time to give CAPD the attention it deserves and help those affected live their best lives.",
            "Twelfth Night seems to suggest that donning a disguise can lead to deception, but ultimately, it's crucial to shed that false persona or risk losing one's true self. However, abandoning the charade can result in isolation, as it's a delicate balancing act between self-preservation and maintaining relationships with others. The reactions of those around you can be unpredictable, ranging from indifference to outrage, especially when it comes to deception in matters of gender identity. \n\nThis dilemma is particularly complex when it comes to gender role reversal, as it raises questions about the underlying motivations behind the disguise. In the case of Viola, her decision to pose as a man seems to be driven by a desire for self-protection. As she navigates this new environment, her disguise helps her avoid potential threats, but it also creates a disconnect from her support system and forces her to conceal her true feelings.\n\nViola's ruse is so convincing that Olivia becomes infatuated with her, further complicating matters. Viola's interactions with Orsino also raise questions about her own suppressed emotions, as she's forced to confront her feelings of unrequited love. Some may see this as a progressive exploration of repressed desires, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. The text hints that their emotions may be repressed, and the appearance of Viola/Cesario serves as a catalyst for their self-discovery.\n\nHowever, this interpretation is nuanced, and it's hard to say whether Olivia's feelings for Cesario are genuine or a product of societal norms. Her swift rejection of Cesario and subsequent acceptance of Sebastian as a family member suggest that she's more interested in appearance than substance. This raises questions about the nature of attraction and the societal pressures that shape our desires.",
            "The brutality of German colonial rule has been well-documented, particularly in its treatment of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, the German colonial empire was a complex entity with a diverse array of policies and ruling styles that varied across its territories. This was also reflected in the provision of education, which differed greatly from one colony to another. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a population of educated and literate Africans, which was a far cry from the situation in other colonies. \n\nIn contrast, South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark picture. Unlike East Africa, where the government took a proactive role in establishing state schools and educating the locals, the task of native education in South West Africa was largely left to missionary societies that received limited support from the government. However, the government did invest heavily in the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing state schools and regulating missionary schools to a greater extent. This dichotomy in educational policies had a lasting impact on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, the overwhelming majority of the population in South West Africa remained uneducated and illiterate. Various factors, including social, political, and economic, contributed to this divergent experience.\n\nDespite a wealth of literature on education in the German colonial empire, much of it is in German and deals with the early twentieth century. These studies were primarily focused on describing the educational systems in the colonies. Later works written in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies and in-depth analyses of specific aspects of education, highlighting the differences between various colonies. One of the most notable works on this topic is Cohen's study, which compared the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa and shed light on the factors that led to their differences. Cohen attributes the distinguishing features of South West Africa's educational system to the large settler population.\n\nSouth West Africa stood out among Germany's colonies due to its relatively temperate climate, albeit largely arid desert in some areas. The European population in the colony reflected this, with nearly 15,000 whites residing in South West Africa by 1913, compared to around 5,336 in East Africa, which had the next largest settler population.",
            "It's been a century since popular music exploded onto the scene, and in that time, it's branched out into an astonishing array of genres that's left us all scratching our heads trying to keep up. I mean, who can keep track of all the sub and sub-sub genres within genres like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk? The sheer number of them is mind-boggling. But if I had to pick one genre that's evolved into a behemoth, it's heavy metal rock, which has become the most diverse and expressive genre of all over the past four decades.\n\nWhat sets heavy metal apart is its incredible range of emotions, with a dark and brooding tone that often leans towards the heavier side of the emotional spectrum. And it's not just the music itself - it's the people who make it, too. As soon as heavy metal started gaining traction, musicians began experimenting with it, pushing the boundaries and creating their own sub-genres, which in turn spawned even more sub-sub-genres. It's a never-ending chain of innovation and creativity that continues to this day.\n\nFast-forward to today, and we're faced with an overwhelming array of heavy metal niches that make it hard to pin down exactly what heavy metal is. It's like trying to capture a wild animal - it's constantly evolving, incorporating elements from other genres, and adapting to new influences. But at its core, heavy metal is a movement, not just a genre. So, what is it, exactly?\n\nAt its heart, heavy metal is a movement defined by darkness - a sonic reflection of our deepest, most primal emotions. It's a music of excess - more bass, more volume, more violence, and more theatricality. It's an art form that demands skill, with musicians who can really play their instruments and make it shine through in their music. And, as you might expect, it's also a movement that's deeply tied to the world of substances - the psychedelic magic of the 1970s gave birth to some truly groundbreaking music, as musicians used their experiences with psychedelics as a catalyst for creativity.\n\nHeavy metal's visceral qualities are unmistakable - a raw, unbridled energy that's never been seen before in popular music. It's drawn inspiration from the darkest corners of the human experience, as well as from the Romantic Era's emphasis on emotion and drama. Take, for example, the lyrics of Helter Skelter, a song that's often cited as one of the first heavy metal tracks. It's a brooding, intense piece that captures the highs and lows of the psychedelic experience - and it's a nod to the darker side of the Beatles' sound, which was responding to the Rolling Stones' own darker tone. It's a testament to the power of heavy metal to push boundaries and challenge the status quo.",
            "Several decades before the Surrealist artists began conjuring up their dreamlike works, Henri Rousseau was meticulously crafting his own dreams – both figuratively and literally. His 1910 masterpiece, 'The Dream', not only depicts a woman lost in awe of the wonders she discovers in her dream world but also serves as a reflection of Rousseau's own aspirations as a painter. For years, he had fantasized about receiving recognition, acceptance, and admiration from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, but this dream came with a daunting internal conflict: should he conform to the established styles of painting to gain approval from the art world he idolized, or should he take the road less traveled and forge his own unique path?\n\nBefore delving into the world of 'The Dream', it's essential to grasp Rousseau's personal story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France, Rousseau came from a family that enjoyed a comfortable, middle-class lifestyle. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer, and although Rousseau received no formal art training, he worked as a gabelou, or municipal toll service employee, for 40 years. The misnomer 'douanier', or customs inspector, followed him throughout his early career. The tragic loss of his first wife, Clémence, and their eight infant children left Rousseau with his young daughter Julia and overwhelming grief. Painting became his solace, allowing him to escape into a new life. Unlike his contemporaries, who romanticized the peasant class in their art, Rousseau, a folk painter, drew from the everyday experiences of his own class.\n\nRousseau's yearning for acceptance in the art world is understandable, given his unconventional background and late start in his career. As he began producing art at the same time as other talented and renowned modern artists, he didn't receive the recognition he deserved until the emergence of fellow artist Matisse. According to art historian Jan Gordon, the two artists, while competitors in the art world, differed not only in style and subject matter but also in their motivations. While Matisse sought to avoid painting in a clichéd manner, Rousseau aspired to create conventional works that would earn him a place among the esteemed Artiste Français.",
            "A profound connection has long been perceived between ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. As I ponder this, I'm reminded of John Keats' timeless words in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" where he asserts, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty— That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" It's almost as if we're wired to appreciate ethics and aesthetics without needing explicit instruction or education. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe rather than dictate; we study morality and beauty to decipher what makes a piece of art or literature beautiful or an action moral, rather than establishing set rules for evaluating or creating great art or behavior.\n\nTo put it bluntly, no amount of criticism or analysis can fully grasp the essence of what's good or beautiful. Discussing the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might revolve around aspects like composition, context, or symbolism, but these don't really capture why it's a masterpiece. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often respond with something like, \"There's just something about it\" before elaborating on the subtleties. I believe that both art and ethics can't be reduced to a mere description of their attributes. Flannery O'Connor's insight, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way,\" resonates with me. No matter how thoroughly we dissect a work of literature, there's always a lingering, ineffable quality that remains. Similarly, ethics has this enigmatic quality, as Wittgenstein suggests, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\"\n\nThis transcendent nature of both ethics and aesthetics is what ties them together in my mind. I propose that it's this elusive \"something\" – this je ne sais quoi – that makes art and morality so powerful. This connection point between them is further strengthened when we consider literature, which impacts us on a deeply personal level, though it's impossible to fully articulate. As McKean astutely observes, \"What most distinguishes literature from other arts, what is unique about it, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are less relevant to other arts, like music, but they seem as pertinent to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "As I gaze upon the contemporary Germany, it's undeniable that this country is a powerhouse, a fusion of unique cultures from the shadows of the Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. The same cultural heartbeat can be felt from Cologne along the Rhine River, right through the nucleus of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden, nestled on the Elbe River. Given its distinct culture, it's no wonder that modern-day Germany, as we know it, is an amalgamation of various sources and tribes. \n\nGermany's ancestral roots, known as Germania, have been a topic of heated debate among scholars and historians. The origins of the name are shrouded in mystery, with some attributing it to a Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, who were allegedly referred to as Germans prior to their crossing of the Rhine and battling the Gaulish forces, as described by Tacitus. On the other hand, Julius Caesar first used the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, where he clashed with Germanic tribes that frequently crossed the Rhine under dubious pretenses. Caesar borrowed the term from the Gauls themselves, using it to distinguish between the conquered Gauls and the unconquered Germanic tribes. In his first book on the Gallic Wars, Julius Caesar notes, \"The Germans, who reside beyond the Rhine, are constantly at war with the Gauls... They engage in almost daily battles with the Germans.\" Others propose that the name might be derived from the Gaulish language, referring to a neighboring tribe. Yet another theory suggests that it originated from the spear used in warfare, known as a \"ger\" (Oxford English Dictionary, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating that the Germans were loud and boisterous.\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus, in his AD 98 writing \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" penned a vivid account of the origins of the Germans, stating, \"I consider the Germans to be aboriginal, with no significant intermingling with other races through immigration or cultural exchange. Why would anyone leave Asia, Africa, or Italy for Germany, with its rugged landscape, inclement weather, and stern demeanor, unless it was their homeland?\" (Tacitus, 98) It's unlikely that the Romans would have voluntarily left their empire to settle in Germania, at least not yet. Instead, they would send expeditions into Germania to acquire goods and resources, and occasionally lead military campaigns, but ultimately return to their vast empire. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they resided on the periphery of the Roman Empire, trading their goods and skills by serving in the Roman army (Ozment, 2005, p. 17).",
            "I stood frozen, my mind a complete blank slate gazing at the scene before me. It was as if I'd entered a state of numbness, a practiced detachment that allowed me to observe without judgment or emotional response. Thoughts whizzed in and out of my head in rapid succession, leaving behind a trail of mental fragments that refused to coalesce into anything tangible. My consciousness was in a state of fluid motion, effortlessly processing the visual stimuli in front of me without the burden of abstract thoughts.\n\nI'd once taken art lessons from a talented artist, who recommended I read 'The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.' The book promised to unlock the secrets of perception and artistic expression, and I'd been fascinated by drawing since I was a six-year-old. The technique that resonated with me was the art of framing – literally placing a mental border around the subject, stripping away extraneous details to reveal the essence. It was a fundamental lesson in simplifying complexity.\n\nAt that moment, I couldn't shake off the feeling of being overwhelmed by the mess in front of me. A wealth of sensory information bombarded my senses, refusing to allow me to mentally impose the artist's frame. It was as if I was staring at a kaleidoscope of colors, textures, and shapes, with no clear focal point. Picasso's blue period, Monet's love of greenery, and the Italian Renaissance masters' use of vibrant colors all flashed through my mind, but I couldn't muster the confidence to claim my own artistic vision.\n\nMy fingers instinctively reached for the pencil, and with a surge of creative energy, I began to sketch. My hand moved with a life of its own, as if channeling the pure creative energy at its core. Water swirled, serene and smooth, like a fleeting moment of beauty. But in a sudden, jarring shift, my hand smacked the toilet handle once more, and I was left staring at the same stubborn, brown, and uncooperative package. It was a far cry from the art that had begun to unfurl in my mind's eye.\n\nWith a deep breath, I gripped the mop, set my feet shoulder-width apart, and stared at the offending mess. A faint scowl creased my brow as I pondered the carelessness of the person who'd left this mess. My hand moved toward the wall, grasping the toilet paper, and I deliberately stilled my thoughts, ready to confront the unglamorous task at hand. I dipped my hand slowly into the bowl, the unexpected intimacy of the moment a fleeting echo of a creative spark that seemed to have abandoned me.",
            "Thanks be to the statistics.  For the past few years, we've all witnessed the alarming rise in teenage fatalities behind the wheel. Several factors converge to create this tragic trend among the youngest American drivers. The National Institutes of Health reveal that one aspect of the problem lies in the teen brain's inability to handle the perils of driving. Inexperience is another elephant in the room, causing not only deadly crashes but also a higher rate of rollovers, speeding, and vehicles veering off the road.\n\nThe statistics are even more disturbing when considering the presence of peer passengers. It's a well-known fact that teens often travel with friends, but a study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center highlights a striking correlation: the more youthful the passenger, the greater the risk of traffic accidents.\n\nIn an effort to mitigate this issue, California and other states have implemented provisional driver's licenses, limiting the hours teens can drive and prohibiting other minors as passengers. However, in my opinion, these measures are merely band-aids on a much larger problem. The real issue is that, as a group, the youngest drivers are statistically incapable of adequately managing the risks and responsibilities associated with driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman agrees, suggesting that 18 is still too young for a full driver's license. His research indicates that those under 19-20 years old have a strong desire to take risks for the thrill of it, making it sensible to delay driving until this tendency subsides.\n\nIf we continue to issue driver's licenses to young teens, we'll not only see more fatal accidents but the death toll will likely skyrocket in the next few years. By 2010, the Baby Boomer generation's children will come of age and millions of new teen drivers will flood the roads. \n\nImplementing legislation to address this issue would be straightforward. Schools could continue to offer driver's education classes to initiate the learning process, but no one under 18 should be allowed to operate a vehicle. A provisional permit could still be issued before a full driver's license, with a specified number of practical driving hours required. This number could be based on the hours already mandated by most states (for instance, California requires 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult). Uniform, national legislation on this matter would be a reasonable and effective way to safeguard teens across the country.\n\nThis proposed legislation is far from novel – it's a long-overdue solution to a pressing problem.",
            "Browsing through the Library of Congress's archives, I stumbled upon the early Edison films and decided to give them all a watch. I was particularly drawn to the trick films – there were fifteen of them, hailing from 1895 to 1901. As I delved into these films, I discovered that they relied on creative editing to create illusions. My analysis mainly focused on dissecting the poetic techniques used in most of these trick films and identifying the innovative characteristics that emerged in a few of the later ones. The trick films of the time were largely confined to a set-bound format, shot within a frontal proscenium, utilized long and medium shots, and stuck to the rule of one shot equals one film.\n\nHowever, there were a few daring films at the turn of the century that broke free from these conventions by introducing new elements such as multiple shots. One thing that stood out about these trick films was their consistent use of an interior set within a frontal proscenium frame. The camera remained stationary, refusing to pan or zoom in on the action. This composition was a common trait of early films, drawing inspiration from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. As a result, figures in these trick films were limited in their movement, typically moving side-to-side rather than forward or backward. A classic example can be seen in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where the actors enter from the right side and move horizontally along the frame, only to disappear from view without the camera following them.\n\nThe use of the frontal proscenium style also led to a reliance on long shots and, occasionally, medium shots. Close-ups were a rarity in these trick films, adhering to the theatre and vaudeville tradition where the audience would see the entire performance within the frame. Since the actors remained in the middle ground, close-ups were never a possibility. In most early trick films, one conceptually cohesive shot equaled one physical film, limiting their length to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. This also restricted the use of tricks in storytelling, as most focused on short, vaudeville-style illusions like magic, disappearing acts, and switching tricks with minimal narrative. However, it's worth noting that in a trick film, a single \"shot\" can actually be composed of multiple joined shots to create an illusion of apparition or disappearance. Take The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) for example – a closer examination reveals the moment when the physical shot of Mary's severed \"head\" begins, despite the entire film being conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a true blue advocate for the Republican cause. Though his primary occupation as an agriculturalist and his brief stint in politics didn't quite add up to a long resume, they did cement his reputation as a steadfast champion of personal freedom and government restraint. His passion for an agrarian way of life was the backbone of his stance on governance, and his devotion to this cause colored his opinions on autonomy, constitutionalism, and the judicial system. He firmly believed that the United States had a unique opportunity to create a utopian system, unencumbered by the baggage of a native tradition, allowing the nation's founders to establish a system of self-governance that truly represented the people.\n\nTo Taylor, the natural rights of man were sacrosanct, and he believed that they were all interconnected - that if one right was denied, the value of the others would be diminished. He argued that these rights should be beyond the reach of the government, which he saw as prone to abuse by those with physical prowess and malicious intent. In his view, the so-called \"state of nature\" was a harsh reality, but one that should be mitigated by the establishment of a civilization that valued fairness and justice over might and greed.\n\nTo achieve this ideal society, Taylor believed that a government must be constructed to account for the dual nature of humanity - both good and evil. He was unwavering in his conviction that government would always reflect the virtues and vices of its people. According to him, good principles were those that protected private property, fostered agriculture, and discouraged unchecked capitalism, and a government founded on these principles would function equitably, regardless of who was at the helm. However, self-interest, which he saw as the driving force behind human behavior, was only a problem when it prioritized individual gain over the common good.\n\nTaylor, like many of his fellow Republicans, was a staunch advocate for a strict construction of the Constitution, with a Federal government that possessed only the powers explicitly granted to it by the document. He believed that a limited government was inherently more efficient and less prone to tyranny, but also warned that a literal interpretation of the Constitution without regard for its original intent was a recipe for disaster. Furthermore, he saw the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, as it more explicitly enshrined the sovereignty of individual states rather than a unified nation.",
            "Looking at Figure 17, we noticed a dramatic decline in commuter log submissions in the third month of our project. It was a bit disheartening and we're still trying to figure out what caused it. Winter is probably to blame, at least in part, as folks on our New England campus are less likely to bike or walk during the cold months. Then there's the end of the fall semester, which keeps everyone busy with schoolwork, grades, and more, making it easy to overlook the commuter log. The holiday season also sets in around December, with a long break for students and faculty, so it's no surprise that many people don't need to come to campus that month. We do see a lull in activity after the break, which resumes in late January. But, we still can't explain the low number of submissions in February. Perhaps it's just the natural ebb and flow of a project, where the initial excitement eventually wears off. To combat this, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a special campaign that got people back on board and resulted in a spike in log submissions that month. Our challenge, however, was to maintain momentum despite the inevitable decrease in engagement, as well as the holiday and semester breaks that come with higher education. \n\nAnother obstacle we faced (and one that's inherent in any alternative commuting project) is that people love the freedom, independence, and flexibility that comes with driving their own cars. It's deeply ingrained in our culture, making it essential to offer incentives for switching to alternative modes of transportation. We offered a range of prizes, from gift certificates to local restaurants and coffee shops to massages and bookstore discounts. It would have been interesting to see how bigger prizes, like a nice bicycle or a hybrid car, might have affected participation. Perhaps if we'd offered increasingly valuable prizes throughout the project, we could have prevented that dip in engagement. Our prize offerings remained the same throughout, but if we'd announced bigger and better prizes, like a bicycle in December and a hybrid car in January, we might have seen participation and engagement increase instead of decrease.",
            "I'm still getting used to the wild world of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), but one thing's for sure - they're a game-changer. Essentially, an ETF is like a security that tracks an index, commodity, or basket of assets, just like an index fund, but with a twist: it trades like a stock on an exchange. This means you get the benefits of diversification, like owning a piece of every stock in the fund, without the hassle of individually managing each one. Plus, you can sell short, buy on margin, or even purchase as few as a single share in any transaction. And the best part? The expense ratios of ETFs are often significantly lower than those of the average mutual fund. However, there are some downsides to consider, such as paying a commission on each trade, just like when buying or selling individual stocks. \n\nBut with the sheer variety of ETFs available, it can be overwhelming to choose the right one. That's why it's essential for savvy investors to evaluate whether the touted benefits, like diversification, actually live up to the hype. In this case, we're taking a closer look at the ETF IHF and comparing it to its top 10 holdings to see if owning a single ETF is worth it. We'll also examine whether a portfolio of these 10 stocks can provide similar benefits to a diversified portfolio of the same stocks. To keep things manageable, we're focusing on the top 10 holdings, which account for a whopping 63.58% of the ETF's assets.\n\nTo gauge how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF as a whole, we've calculated their contributions to the portfolio's beta and return, assuming a portfolio made up entirely of these stocks in the same proportions as the ETF. The results are telling: a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings would yield a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. What's more, the beta of this portfolio is 0.12 lower than the ETF's, suggesting a potentially more stable investment. However, there's a chance that these results might not be statistically significant.\n\nTo get a better understanding of the data, we've also calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100% to compare them to the ETF IHF. This will give us insight into the potential risks and rewards of investing in these stocks, and whether a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings is a viable alternative to the ETF.",
            "I've always been fascinated by Edgar Allan Poe's \"Dream-Land,\" one of his self-proclaimed masterpieces. The poem's use of the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56 is particularly intriguing. My research led me to Virgil, who first used the term to describe an island north of Britain, believed to be the edge of the known world. However, there's a more contemporary source that sheds light on Poe's familiarity with German authors. Poe was indeed enamored with Goethe's writing.\n\nThis connection is significant because it highlights Poe's influence from Goethe. As Karl J. Arndt notes in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" Poe's poem bears a striking resemblance to Goethe's work, suggesting that Poe may have been drawing inspiration from the German author. \n\nOxford Companion to English Literature credits Goethe as a celebrated writer of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" which was published in two parts, with the first installment coming out in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe's passing. Within the second part of \"Faust,\" there's a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem tells the story of a king whose wife gives him a goblet before her untimely death. The king's descent into grief and despair is marked by excessive drinking, and he ultimately decides to join his wife in death.\n\nThe similarity between the King of Thule and the character in \"Dream-Land\" is striking, with both figures being haunted by loss and finding solace in drink. Interestingly, Goethe's \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe's use of the term Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" \n\nPoe references Thule twice in his collected works, using the phrase \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and employing it as a bookend in \"Dream-Land.\" When read alongside Goethe's \"The King of Thule,\" the two poems can be seen as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a desolate landscape of Thule, marked by darkness, loneliness, and a world devoid of color. This echoes the King of Thule's story, who has lost his will to live after the passing of his wife.\n\nGiven Poe's admiration for Tennyson, it's likely that he would have been familiar with Goethe's work. Poe's statement on Tennyson aside, it's clear that he would have been exposed to Goethe's writing through various reproductions and adaptations that followed the original publication.",
            "Here's the juicy stuff that could help a customer injured from slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store get a hefty chunk of change from the store manager.  I'm talking punitive damages, baby - the kind that can make someone's wallet weep. So, under California law, is this possible? Can Jennifer Palmer, the injured party, show that the store manager, Paul Martin, acted with malice when he ignored the spill for a whole half-hour because he was too busy eating dinner? \n\nRest assured, a judge won't dismiss her claim without a fight. To win punitive damages, Palmer needs to show that Martin recklessly disregarded the harm that could come from not cleaning up the spill. She can argue that the manager should have known better since multiple customers had slipped on the same spot in the months leading up to her accident. And let's not forget, he still didn't do squat to fix it despite all those prior incidents.\n\nNow, some might say Palmer's argument about Martin's actions being despicable is a bit of a stretch, but it's not entirely unreasonable given the facts. Six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009 and no action taken to prevent them? That's just not cool.\n\nLet's take a trip down memory lane. On October 13th, 2009, around 5 pm, an employee, Rich Wayne, told Martin about the applesauce spill, but he blew him off, saying he was on dinner break. Another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also warned Martin about the spill 15 minutes later, but he gave her the same brush-off. Guess who slipped and fell on the spill at 5:30 pm? That's right, Jennifer Palmer, and she ended up with a serious back injury. It's no wonder she's suing D&D Markets for compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nIn California, if a defendant acts with \"oppression, fraud or malice,\" a plaintiff can win punitive damages for a breach of obligation not arising from a contract. The law defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm or, if no intent, the defendant's actions were so bad that they demonstrate a \"willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" So, was Martin's inaction a malicious act? Did he know the probable harm that could come from not cleaning up the spill, and did he deliberately ignore it? According to the courts, a defendant's actions are malicious if they knew the likely consequences of their actions and chose to ignore them.\n\nIn this case, the courts might just decide that Martin's actions were indeed malicious, and Palmer could be on her way to a fat check. But we're not there yet. It's time to see if we should file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim. Stay tuned!",
            "It's been almost four years since I took a course in Islam at CBC, and the topic of whether Islam is a hostile religion remains a pressing issue.  I firmly believe that this question is more relevant now than ever, especially considering the media's shift in perspective since 9/11.  I recall the way the media used to portray Islam and extremists as hostile entities, only to swing to the opposite end of the spectrum and become excessively tolerant of Islam in America.  It's hard to imagine that in 2001, a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, with an openly Muslim background, could have even been considered viable.\n\nThe Biography of the Prophet Muhammad has left me with a compelling narrative that contradicts the man I thought I knew from history.  According to my understanding, Muhammad was supposed to be a figure who forced people to convert to Islam after conquering tribes and imposing his rule.  However, the biography paints a completely different picture – that of a humble, misunderstood, and humbled individual who was shunned by others but ultimately drew followers who saw the truth in his teachings.  This portrayal has left me questioning the validity of the history I thought I knew.\n\nThe parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the supposed miracles of Muhammad are remarkable.  One of the most striking examples is the story of feeding forty men with a small amount of mutton and milk, which seems eerily similar to Jesus' miracle of feeding the multitudes.  It's this type of writing that makes me suspect the authors were trying to portray Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove anything, but lived a life of truth and miracles.  This approach undermines the significance of Jesus' life and ministry, making it seem like a pale imitation.\n\nI also find it interesting that the biography features many stories that aim to provide proof of 'witness' or show how people converted to Islam of their own accord.  However, these stories often rely on third-party accounts, which diminish their credibility in my eyes.  While the authors intended to provide evidence of the truth, it only makes the stories seem more suspect and less authentic.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this work is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly figure, portraying him as humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  History, however, contradicts this image, and I can't help but wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true story behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "As Christianity progressed beyond its roots, the teachings of Jesus and the core beliefs he held during his lifetime were cast aside in favor of a more developed theory. When viewed from a broad perspective, a pattern emerges of Christianity gradually straying further and further from its authentic origin. Today, an increasing awareness and a shift towards progression are underway, revealing a growing desire for a return to the true essence of the faith. While traditionalists may cling to established doctrine, they may not be numerous enough to influence the broader masses. As time passes, however, a historical awareness will grow among Christians, driving a yearning to distinguish between the original intent of Christianity and the doctrines that were added over time. This reversal of trends will eventually lead to a movement that sheds its accumulated layers, gradually stripping away the extraneous to reveal the pure essence of Jesus' original message. A gradual clock-like motion will be seen as people return to the core principles Jesus instilled, untainted by the additions of subsequent thinkers.  As this forward-thinking movement sweeps through the United States and Europe, expect to see a shift from the current divergence towards a more uniform and cohesive understanding of the faith. The church, as an institution, will remain a guiding force, but the turbulent diversity of Christendom will give way to increased uniformity across regions, denominations, and divisions. History is replete with examples of such reversals – consider how Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire, only to see the empire eventually adopt Christianity. Similarly, the United States transitioned from slavery to African-American leadership. In the future, Christianity will undergo a profound reversal, undoing the accumulated history in the quest for its authentic roots, and in the process, shedding its diversity. A crucial aspect of this shift will be reinterpreting Jesus' words as metaphorical rather than literal statements. Looking back, we find the seeds of Christianity in Judaism, which flourished as a divinely revealed, monotheistic faith before the Roman Empire's control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population was not a homogeneous entity; it was fragmented into various groups, including the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common folk.",
            "As I reflect on the timeless classic, The Jungle, I'm struck by the harsh reality that deep down, humans are often driven by self-interest and a desire for personal gain, leaving those in lower positions to fend for themselves. This is starkly illustrated in the novel, particularly through the lens of the factory owners and managers. Their only concern is to expand and thrive, no matter the cost to others or the environment. They're depicted as callous and ruthless, with no regard for the devastating impact of their actions, as Upton Sinclair masterfully conveys through the vivid image of the factories' towering chimneys belching smoke into the air, symbolizing the destruction they cause. The owners and managers show no empathy for the harm their endeavors inflict on the people and animals living in the shadows of Packingtown, nor do they care about the well-being of their employees, whom they treat as nothing more than means to an end. They're driven by a relentless pursuit of profit, as Sinclair so poignantly puts it: \"So from top to bottom, this place is a seething cauldron of jealousy and hatred, devoid of loyalty and decency, where a man is nothing more than a commodity to be exploited for a dollar.\" During the era in which the book is set, workers were at the mercy of their employers, forced to toil in inhumane conditions with little to no protection or support. The system was designed to prioritize profit over people, leaving workers to suffer and struggle in a desperate fight for survival. The novel suggests that the workers were, in effect, treated as slaves, their lives hanging in the balance of their employers' whims, with no escape from the crushing system of Packingtown.",
            "Many authors employ various tactics to evoke a particular sentiment or attitude in their readers. The effectiveness of these techniques can vary, but F. Scott Fitzgerald masterfully weaves them throughout his novel, The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs seemingly mismatched adjectives and nouns to conjure a specific atmosphere around a subject. He also assigns meaning to symbols and later utilizes them to convey a particular mood. This technique is particularly evident in his use of colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink.\n\nIn The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald meticulously builds up associations for white/gray, then skillfully employs them to elicit a certain response from his readers. The significance he attributes to white/gray is uniformity, with white generally representing a more refined and upper-class connotation, while gray carries a sense of age and faded elegance. Fitzgerald sets the stage for these meanings early in the novel through repeated references to both colors. We see this in the way Daisy and Jordan are constantly \"in white\" (8) – everyone, it seems, is donning white attire: Nick sports \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby's party, Tom wears a \"white shirt\" (36) when meeting Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only time white attire is absent is during Nick's initial impressions of Gatsby's party, where the halls are \"gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further defines these colors by associating them with everyday, mundane subjects: as Nick heads to work, he navigates \"the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the names of people at Gatsby's parties become \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's timetable, and Catherine's apartment is likened to \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\" – epitomizing uniformity.\n\nFitzgerald then uses these established meanings to convey a sense of unimportance or uniformity in certain subjects. This process begins with Daisy. After a prolonged period without significant use of white/gray, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster\"; readers start to perceive Daisy as less of a distinct character and more of a uniform entity, a mere aspiration for Gatsby (74). Fitzgerald employs this technique repeatedly to reinforce this impression of Daisy as a uniform addition, as seen in the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18) and her appearance in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "The San Diego County is a veritable garden of plenty, thanks to its sun-kissed climate that makes it an ideal place for agriculture. The region is blessed with a diverse array of crops, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There's a thriving market for organic community supported agriculture food in the area, with many local organizations boasting lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand, and some farms even offer tours of their operations, along with opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This type of farming operation allows landowners to tap into government programs while preserving the land's natural beauty, creating a win-win situation for both the environment and their bank accounts.\n\nHowever, organic farming isn't without its challenges. It requires more labor and management to maintain soil health without relying on chemicals, which can lead to greater costs and losses compared to conventional farming methods. Small organic farms often lack the efficiency of large-scale operations, making it harder to compete in the market. Other practices that benefit wildlife, such as planting cover crops and removing invasive species, also incur additional labor costs. As a result, landowners in this scenario might seek financial assistance or expert guidance to maximize their profits while preserving the land's biodiversity.\n\nThe chosen property is a 160-acre plot adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. The land is a mix of chaparral, non-native grassland, and oak woodland, nestled next to the Cleveland National Forest within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. This plan, still under review, aims to protect over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered or declining, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and several butterfly species. The area has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This particular piece of land was likely used for grazing and wood production for many years, given its original homestead patent status.\n\nTo explore the options available to a small farmer in this area, I chose a property from a real estate website and researched government programs that could help mitigate costs and support wildlife-friendly farming practices. As a model for what someone farming this land might aim to achieve, I looked at an existing organic farm in the same region.",
            "The intricacies of culture play a pivotal role in any negotiation, but they're often misunderstood or oversimplified. Culture is a complex web of nuances that can be just as easily defined by what it's not as by what it is. It's not a monolith, nor is it uniform or one-dimensional. Statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are woefully broad and reductive. A more productive approach for a negotiator is to grasp the significance of a culture in relation to the specific issue at hand and how its attitude will impact the negotiations. When engaging with a foreign culture, we inevitably view it through the lens of our own, and comparisons inevitably arise. \n\nDelving into a foreign culture often requires a multidisciplinary approach, encompassing everything from historical context to understanding its biases. Rather than judging or trying to change a culture, it's essential to accept it for what it is and navigate its boundaries, particularly in high-stakes negotiations where a weaker bargaining position is at play. When operating in unfamiliar territory, a deep respect for local traditions and customs can be a game-changer in breaking down cultural barriers and moving the negotiation forward.\n\nIt's a common misconception that culture is solely bound by national or international borders. In reality, many companies within a given nation have their own distinct corporate cultures that can be just as influential as any national culture. This can manifest in everything from dress codes and communication styles to hiring practices and employee values. Even within the United States, corporate cultures vary wildly from company to company, and within companies, there are often regional and urban-suburban differences that showcase the diversity of thought within a particular societal culture. Don't be fooled by a uniform exterior – it's often a sign to dig deeper.\n\nValues are the key to understanding the underlying dynamics of a culture. If a culture places a high value on saving face or communal harmony, a negotiator will likely avoid publicly embarrassing their company or superior in pursuit of a deal. Conversely, a culture that prioritizes driving a hard bargain won't necessarily be willing to settle at the earliest opportunity. By considering these cultural nuances before the negotiating table, you'll be better equipped to navigate the complexities of cross-cultural negotiation. But it's equally important to learn about your opponent on a personal level to make the negotiation a success.",
            "We often hear the phrase, \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God,'\" which originates in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and is famously referenced by St. Anselm in his argument for the existence of God. Interestingly, Thomas Aquinas seems to share this sentiment, and as we delve into their arguments, it's worth assuming they're both correct in their belief, specifically in the God of the Bible. If we were to consider a different concept of God, it would skew our comparison, as their arguments are centered around a particular idea of the divine. Therefore, let's begin by accepting their shared premise for the sake of clarity.\n\nWhile both authors bring up valid points, neither provides a comprehensive foundation for faith in God. To illustrate this, let's break down St. Anselm's basic argument. He suggests that understanding and proof of God can be found within ourselves, through introspection and faith. According to Anselm, because our minds inherently grasp the concept of God, we can't effectively conceive of his nonexistence. On the surface, this idea might be wordy and unclear, but in essence, Anselm is saying that the truth about God is within our own minds and doesn't require external evidence. This concept of accepting the truth without empirical proof is often referred to as faith in Christian texts.\n\nIn stark contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas proposes that God's existence can be proven solely through reason and empirical evidence, eliminating the need for faith altogether. This idea would be beneficial in evangelism, as it would allow for the recruitment of new converts based on logic rather than blind faith. Aquinas presents five logical arguments supporting God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for his existence. Think of it like this: if you're told you're missing a puzzle piece and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can infer the features and existence of the missing piece without seeing it.",
            "Twenty-five hundred years ago, a prince destined to become the revered figure known as Buddha was born. Throughout the course of his life, he renounced worldly pursuits and achieved enlightenment, paving the way for the emergence of Buddhism. This ancient faith has undergone significant transformations since its inception, a phenomenon evident in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is an integral part of the culture. Despite the fact that Buddha never preached about such festivities, this event brings together monks and laypeople alike, reflecting the dynamic evolution of the religion. From superficial customs to its fundamental tenets, the Theravada Buddhist community has had to adapt its principles over time. This metamorphosis can be attributed to factors both within and outside the Buddhist fold, encompassing a range of influences, from the benign to the hostile.\n\nTo facilitate this discussion, it's essential to understand the key terms that will be used throughout. Internally, an internal force refers to any influence originating from within the Buddhist community, regardless of one's monastic status. Conversely, an external force is any influence stemming from non-Buddhists. As for hostile and benign forces, a hostile force is any influence that seeks to harm or damage the Buddhist community, often driven by a negative perception of the faith. A benign force, on the other hand, is an influence that neither wishes to harm nor help the community, though it might inadvertently do so.\n\nNow, let's delve into the core of Theravada Buddhism, exploring the fundamental doctrines that form its foundation. At the heart of the faith lies the concept of the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma encompasses the Tripitaka, a collection of sacred texts divided into three baskets: the Sutta Pitaka (containing the Suttas), the Vinaya Pitaka (outlining disciplinary rules), and the Abhidhamma Pitaka (dealing with metaphysical concepts). Central to these metaphysical notions are the principles of Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering in life), and Anicca (the impermanence of everything). Recognizing these concepts holds the key to breaking free from Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, and ultimately transcending lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). In the Vinaya Pitaka, guidelines for daily life are established, with five precepts for laypeople (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not engage in misconduct, and I shall not consume intoxicating substances) and additional disciplinary rules for monks. At the heart of Buddhism lies the four noble truths, a fundamental doctrine that encompasses the reality of suffering (Dukkha), the causes of suffering (attachment), and the possibility of overcoming suffering.",
            "For over five decades, the United States and Mexico were locked in a bitter rivalry that would leave a lasting impact on their relationship. From 1836 to 1893, tensions simmered between the two nations, with the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848 being the turning point. This conflict saw the United States emerge victorious, claiming Texas and the American Southwest as its own. However, clashes between the two nations continued to erupt over the years, finally dying down just before the outbreak of World War I.\n\nAt its core, the rivalry between the United States and Mexico was fueled by deep-seated differences over issues like religion, culture, and tradition. Material interests also played a significant role in exacerbating the tensions between the two nations. It's a pattern we see repeated in many other rivalries between nations that share a border, where clashing interests inevitably lead to the development of opposing positions.\n\nDavid M. Pletcher noted that the United States had long-standing diplomatic issues with two countries in particular: Mexico and Cuba. Given their geographical proximity to the United States, it's no surprise that these nations have historically found themselves at odds with America. In contrast, many other Latin American countries have enjoyed more harmonious relations with the United States.\n\nThe religious divide between the United States and Mexico was a significant factor in their rivalry. Sally Frahm pointed out that Americans were long opposed to Catholicism and monarchy, which created a deep-seated distrust between the two nations. This ideological struggle was reminiscent of the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, but in this case, the stakes were tied to religious differences rather than politics. The lingering effects of English-Spanish animosity only served to further complicate the relationship between the two nations.\n\nAccording to Diehl and Goerts, there were 17 notable disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry period. Many of these disputes centered on territorial issues, including border raids and frontier problems. Bandits and outlaws from both sides of the border posed a major challenge that wasn't fully addressed until both countries deployed military force to secure their borders.\n\nAs Schmitt noted, the rivalry between the United States and Mexico finally began to dissipate as Mexico became increasingly dependent on its northern neighbor. The shift in American ambitions from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico marked the beginning of a new era in their relationship, one that would eventually lead to a more peaceful and cooperative relationship between the two nations.",
            "Fifteen years ago, my life took an unexpected detour when a mysterious illness struck, leaving me disabled and out of the workforce. I was a nurse, a career I had chosen for its stability after hearing the constant mantra in my youth: \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\" My true passions lay in science and journalism, but I opted for nursing to ensure a secure future. \n\nNow, at 46, I'm single, with nothing to show for it, relying on Social Security Disability for survival. It's a daily struggle, a relentless assault on my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Yet, amidst this chaos, I've come to realize that the one constant in my life is the unwavering support of my family and a handful of true friends. When disaster hits, you're not as invincible as you think. \n\nMy point is that life is full of unexpected challenges, big and small. No matter how well-prepared you are, some storms are too intense to weather alone. \n\nWhile it's essential to take responsibility for our own lives, I strongly believe we need to shift our focus from solely relying on the government to learning to trust and support one another. Rather than building individual shelters, we should strive to build a community where neighbors look out for each other. \n\nThe concept of rugged individualism, often touted by Conservatives, is a myth. It was compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources that saw our ancestors through the tough times, not self-reliance. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it alone; they worked together.\n\nBy all means, be prepared. I've invested in a disaster kit, first-aid supplies, and other essentials. If you have the means, consider starting a small farm or investing in a wood stove. However, don't overlook the most vital survival tool of all – building strong relationships with those around you. Get to know your neighbors, and together, you'll be better equipped to face life's uncertainties.",
            "We often ponder the enigma of why organisms evolve in the manner that they do. Are there unseen forces at play that shape the course of evolutionary change? While D'Arcy Thompson astutely observed in 1917 that the task of defining organic forms in mathematical terms was still a distant dream, we're still far from grasping this complexity today. However, recent advances in mathematical modeling have begun to shed light on the intricacies of mollusk development, particularly in the realm of skeletogenesis (Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research seeks to leverage mathematical modeling, in tandem with experimental studies, to unravel the underlying mechanisms driving the direction and magnitude of evolutionary change in Prunum.\n\nTo achieve this, we're examining how X-radiographic images of Prunum species can be used to quantify parameters that can then be input into software programs like CerioShell (Stone, 1995) to model hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. These models enable us to explore the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum, providing a framework for understanding macroevolutionary events within this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a spiral tube that traverses 360 degrees of space over time. This spiral path is composed of whorls, which are formed by the animal's growth and are considered to be centered around an imaginary axis, known as the columella. The speed at which each whorl enlarges can vary, and a continuous line separating each whorl is referred to as a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the body whorl, while the spire consists of all the whorls except the last. The apex, or tip, of the spire marks the beginning, while the base represents the opposite end. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from different perspectives, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. Typically, shells are depicted in apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.\n\nTo count whorls accurately, one must first view the shell from the apical perspective and identify the starting point of the first suture. A line can then be drawn, dividing the shell into two parts, and whorls can be counted from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures that unfold through time and space as the animal adds to its shell. By tracing the path of the aperture using the center coordinates of each whorl's aperture and its horizontal and vertical radius, we can create a mathematical representation of this trajectory. This mathematical formulation enables us to manipulate parameters and modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "I've been pondering the stark reality of neonatal and infant mortality rates in Indonesia, which have remained stubbornly stagnant for a decade. As the country makes strides in meeting Millennium Development Goals such as water and sanitation targets, its progress in child and maternal health lags woefully behind. The reasons for this disappointing trend are multifaceted and point to a pressing need to fortify the overall health system rather than relying on piecemeal interventions.\n\nIndonesia has made some progress in increasing the number of births attended by skilled health workers, with a commendable 72% now meeting this benchmark. However, this statistic is somewhat misleading, as it still includes traditional workers like midwives who are unable to provide medical interventions in complicated cases, leading to a disproportionate number of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage. Furthermore, there's been a concerning decline in the percentage of children under five receiving treatment for diarrheal cases from a health professional, and data on postnatal care is woefully inadequate.\n\nAnother worrisome trend is the relatively low cesarian-section rate of around 4%, which is compounded by the stark disparities between urban and rural areas – 7% in cities versus a paltry 2% in rural regions. This stark contrast highlights the issue of unequal access to healthcare services, with urban areas receiving preferential treatment. Vertical equity is another concern, with a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, suggesting that the poor are facing significant barriers in accessing healthcare due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nAs we consider the next steps to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the fundamental question is how to address the chronic shortage of services. Should Indonesia focus on developing targeted programmatic approaches or strengthen its overall health system without pandering to the specific needs of pre and post-pregnancy care for mothers and their children? While programmatic approaches may seem attractive, they have their drawbacks. For instance, investing heavily in one area can divert resources away from other critical areas, leading to a brain drain of human resources and duplication of services. This not only wastes resources but also creates an administrative nightmare with excessive forms and paperwork.",
            "Victorian novels are infamous for their meticulous attention to detail and their focus on the lives of the aristocracy of the time.  However, two novels that break away from this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both works incorporate an air of mystery and an affinity for the bizarre, traits that were uncommon in novels of the period, but which serve to strengthen the characters within each story, offering a deeper look into their motivations and emotions.\n\nAs Oliver Twist navigated the treacherous world of Victorian London, a maelstrom of bewildering ideas swirled inside his mind. The echoes of his encounters with Sikes and Crackit lingered, their voices arguing in his ears, while his own thoughts struggled to regain focus. The sound of gunfire shattered the silence, and Oliver was swept up in a whirlwind of confusion as unseen forces bore him away. Amidst the chaos, a gnawing sense of pain and discomfort gnawed at him, refusing to let him escape.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, these unsettling occurrences often manifest as dream sequences or dreamlike states, revealing hidden facets of Oliver's psyche and the turmoil that wracked his inner world. When Oliver relives the moment of his near-fatal shooting in chapter 28, the scene unfolds with a dreamlike quality, as if he's reliving the trauma all over again while desperately seeking help. This passage highlights Oliver's powerlessness in the face of the events that have unfolded, and the dire state of his health, which is reflected in his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, numbing all his senses as an unseen force bears him away, leaving him to relive his despair in a state of constant fear rather than shock. This event raises questions about whose actions led to his misfortune, as it's clear that Oliver's fate was not of his own making. The scene also implies a growing sense of defeat in Oliver, as if Fagin's influence has broken him, forcing him to accept his despair and rendering him unable to react.\n\nThe passage from Wuthering Heights reads like a haunting refrain: \"The day passed – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\" This sense of time's fluidity, where day and night blur into one another, creates a sense of disorientation, underscoring the turmoil that pervades the story. The passage speaks to the novel's use of time as a fluid, malleable concept, where the boundaries between reality and fantasy blur, and the characters are left to navigate the uncertainties of their own lives.",
            "I still remember my time working in an after-school program, where I was tasked with tutoring elementary students in a variety of subjects, but my true passion lay in helping them with reading and English. One student in particular, a young boy named Adrian, really stood out to me. He was around third or fourth grade, and I was assigned to work with him because he was struggling to read. What struck me as peculiar was that some letters he could pronounce flawlessly, while others left him completely stumped – it was as if he was speaking a different language. Given that he was Latino, I assumed that might be the issue, but his English was spotless. I spent many sessions with him, trying to figure out the problem, until the day his mother walked into the room. Her only language was Spanish, and I attempted to communicate with her using my limited Spanish skills. It was a defining moment – I realized that Adrian's struggles weren't about reading, but rather, he didn't know the English alphabet. I hope he's found success since then.\n\nSharing this story highlights the complex issue of the language barrier in schools, especially here in California. It's a problem that's often overlooked, but it's not always as straightforward as we think. Even a child who speaks perfect English can struggle with reading, as I learned with Adrian. We all agree that this issue exists, so what's the solution? In Adrian's case, it was as simple as extra English reading tutoring, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for students who barely speak English, it's a much more complex problem.\n\nThere's no single answer, but rather a combination of approaches that work together. The dual language system is a great concept, not just for kids who speak Spanish as their first language, but for all children. Research shows that students in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Many people fear that this system is a waste of resources, but it's not true. If we implemented this approach as a standard, all children would benefit from it. So, how do we make this happen? Do we require teachers to be bilingual? That's unrealistic, but we can hire bilingual aids, tutors, or whatever we want to call them, to support our students.",
            "From the time we're young, many of us are taught that there's something greater than ourselves, something that transcends our understanding. Some of us are sent to Sunday school, while others seek answers within themselves or explore the spiritual paths our parents have laid out for us. Some accept these teachings without question, while others reject them entirely, choosing to forge their own paths. We might adopt one set of values, only to later discard them for another. Ultimately, our search for meaning leads us down a winding road to discover a part of ourselves through our unique perspectives on spirituality, seeking a guiding light to lead us out of the darkness and into the light.\n\n[The memory of that rainy evening still lingers.] My dad and I sat on our front porch, listening to the rain drum against the tin roof above. We both smoked cigarettes, lost in our own thoughts. The rainwater pouring from the gutters drowned the plants at the edge of the porch, and my dad's eyes gazed out into the downpour, a mix of introspection and distant recollection. His frame seemed smaller, his clothes hanging loosely, and his hair was thinner than I remembered. That's when I realized he was struggling – and I was struggling too. I couldn't bring myself to talk about how much I'd miss him, as acknowledging it would make it all too real. Instead, I hugged him, sat down beside him, and joined him in gazing out into the rain.\n\nMy dad passed away that December, just five days before my twenty-second birthday. The treatments had prolonged his suffering, but at what cost? I couldn't fathom it. As I lay alone in the dark, I didn't pray. If a higher power existed, I thought, it had long since stopped listening to me. \n\nI refused to watch him slip away. I chose to remember my dad through his life, not his final moments. I knew him better than anyone, and I was certain he wouldn't have wanted me to be there for his passing. I curled up in my bed for three days, waiting for the news. And yet, no one even called.",
            "The Gothic Novel: A Timeless Contradiction \nI still chuckle when I think about Ian Watt's clever description of the Gothic Novel as an 'oxymoron for Old-New.' It was as if he was trying to capture the essence of this peculiar literary beast that has been both revered and ridiculed throughout history. Critics have attacked the Gothic genre for lacking depth, yet praised it for its ability to evoke the 'terrible sublime.' (Burke) The genre has been around since the 18th century, when Horace Walpole first penned The Castle of Otranto, a true pioneer in the proto-Gothic genre. By combining the 'old' theatrical elements of medieval romances with the 'new' novelistic format, Walpole created something entirely new - a Gothic Story. \n\nAs I delve into the world of Gothic literature, I notice how it often relies on throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. It was a time when the word 'gothic' was used to describe everything from people to styles to time periods, often with a hint of nostalgia and a dash of disdain for the 'modern' world. It's fascinating to see how Walpole merged the grandeur of the Gothic with the intimacy of the novel, creating a reading experience that feels both ancient and modern. \n\nOne of the key aspects of Gothic literature that has captured my attention is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of training a proper knight is woven throughout the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is particularly significant in Gothic writing because it represents a bygone era of bravery, honor, and competence - an era that many writers, like Walpole, felt was sadly lacking in their own time. By romanticizing the 'gothic past,' writers like Walpole aimed to critique their own society and, perhaps, even hint at the future evolution of Gothic to Romanticism. \n\nAs I read through The Castle of Otranto, I'm struck by the character of Frederic, a prince who embodies many chivalric traits. His description is a masterclass in Gothic tropes: a prince, a victim of tragedy, and a man shrouded in mystery. The image of the 'gallant and courteous Knight' is exaggerated, of course, but it's a perfect example of how excess was used to create a sense of drama and tension in the Gothic genre. As I ponder the complexities of Gothic literature, I'm reminded that even in its contradictions, there's a timeless beauty to be found.",
            "I've witnessed the evolution of supply chain management, a world of intricate processes that weaves together raw materials, production, and distribution to meet the ever-changing demands of customers. The term supply chain management was coined by Keith Oliver in 1982, a consultant with an eye for efficiency. Oliver described the delicate dance of planning, implementing, and controlling the supply chain to deliver customer satisfaction in a swift and seamless manner. \n\nAt the heart of supply chain management lies six essential elements: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These building blocks enable business managers to craft an experience that leaves customers wanting more. \n\nProduction is the foundation upon which the entire supply chain stands. It's the stage where the 'when,' 'why,' 'where,' and 'how' of product creation are carefully laid out. Managers must tune in to the market to grasp what customers crave. The market is the barometer that indicates the customer's desires, and by analyzing it, managers can decide what products to produce, how many to produce, and where to produce them. The goal is to meet customer demands while ensuring the best quality and volume.\n\nOnce production is underway, managers focus on scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. Every detail is crucial in this process, and mishaps can cost the company dearly in the long run. I've seen firsthand how having a clear process in place can make all the difference at companies like Wal-Mart and Target, where every aspect of the business, from employee attire to shipment reception, is meticulously planned.\n\nSupply is the second vital element in the supply chain equation. It involves strategic decisions about a company's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. Managers must decide which divisions of production are best suited for specific products, taking into account the equipment, personnel, and specialties required. Outsourcing work to other companies can be a smart move, as it enables the creation of velocity – the ability to deliver quality, flexibility, and low costs.",
            "A haunting message lurks on a street corner, Ellen Page's cardboard sign held high, the Sharpie-written words 'Hitler is alive in Burma' a stark reality check. Burma, now Myanmar, has been under the iron grip of a ruthless military junta since 1962, when the country was seized through a brutal coup d'état. The echoes of 2007 still linger, when a wave of protests swept the nation, known as the Saffron Revolution, in honor of the saffron-colored robes worn by the courageous Burmese monks who led the charge. What began as peaceful gatherings soon turned into a bloody conflict, with the military junta unleashing its wrath on monasteries and foreign journalists, including Japanese photojournalist Kenji Nagai, who fell to their brutality on September 27th, 2007. The official death toll may be 13, but defector Colonel Hla Win revealed a chilling truth: the real number of victims could be in the thousands.\n\nThis isn't a relic of the past. The world has been witnessing this tragic tale for millennia, as governments pursue power and silence dissent with ruthless abandon. From ancient Roman emperors claiming divine right to rule, to Japanese emperors deified as gods, to our own modern-day leaders who seem to answer to none, this dark chapter has been etched in human history. We see echoes of Tiananmen Square in 1989, where students, intellectuals, and labor activists dared to challenge the authorities, and the death toll may never be known for certain – 200 to 3,000, depending on who you believe. The Rwandan genocide, Hitler's Third Reich, and countless other atrocities serve as grim reminders of the horrors that unfold when governments turn against their own people.",
            "The unyielding legacy of Duke Ellington in the realm of jazz can be attributed in large part to his remarkable longevity and the boundless creative influence he exerted through his orchestra. Although his piano presence is understated in many of the compositions selected for this particular task, as a composer Ellington masterfully crafted complex, rich pieces that showcased the unique talents of individual band members. He skillfully wove the framework, allowing soloists to improvise freely, while also penning tightly orchestrated phrases that highlighted the distinct styles of his musicians. In doing so, Ellington successfully emphasized the ensemble's overall tone, creating original and coherent sounds to match each piece. Through his profound understanding of the individual players' sounds and how they blended together to form a cohesive unit, Ellington was able to produce some of the most groundbreaking and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\n\nA notable example of Ellington's innovative approach to sound is evident in his use of voice as an instrument, as illustrated in his early piece, Creole Love Call. This twelve bar blues, characterized by its slow and deliberate pace, features six distinct choruses, each showcasing Ellington's ability to complement the style of his soloists. The piece commences with a call and response between voice and reeds, with the voice beginning smoothly and melodically before transitioning to a rougher tone towards the end. This is followed by a muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes. Subsequent choruses feature a sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase, and a full band echo of the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections. The climactic fifth chorus sees the reeds initiating the call and response in a high register, supported by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections. The sixth and final chorus returns to the structure of the first, with call and response between voice and reeds, and in this instance, the voice takes on the sound of the \"growl\" technique, soloing as an instrument. A brief tag concludes the piece with a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is a hallmark of his work, as evident in subsequent compositions such as Hot and Bothered and It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing). In Hot and Bothered, Ellington seamlessly combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color, using a call and response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing to create a rich and complementary sound. Similarly, in It Don't Mean a Thing, Ellington employs Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to great effect, introducing the melody on muted trombone in a way that showcases the unique qualities of Nanton's playing.",
            "I'd been grappling with this unshakeable feeling of incompleteness since I was 14, when the world opened up and I found myself in the midst of teenage chaos. Three years later, at 17, I was still searching for something, though I'd narrowed it down to a desire for connection with someone rather than a mere object. Yet, I remained unimpressed by every boy who crossed my path, as if I was immune to the usual high school allure. I couldn't help but wonder what was behind this peculiarity, and I spent years mulling over various theories. But nothing ever added up, leaving me stuck in this cycle of self-doubt and curiosity.\n\nMy home life was a tranquil oasis amidst the turmoil. My parents were the epitome of calm and composure, rarely arguing with each other or with me – the only exceptions being when I pushed the boundaries of my independence and individuality. They were a peaceful couple, but I was the wild child in our household, bringing a spark of energy and playfulness that made me likable and admired by all who knew me.\n\nBut today was different. As I wandered through the house, searching for inspiration, the sound of my mother's distressed cry pierced the air, followed by the unmistakable tone of her voice. Panic set in as I sprinted towards the kitchen, my heart racing with every step. \"Mom! Mom, what's wrong?!\" I exclaimed, my voice trembling. I rushed into the room to find my mother lying on the ground, wincing in pain, her voice barely above a whisper. I dropped to her side, offering what little support I could. \"Ouch... sweetie, I... need you to take me to... the hospital.\" The words tumbled out in short, labored breaths, and I knew she was in agony. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up,\" I said, trying to keep my voice steady. My mother directed me with her hands, and I was grateful for every ounce of strength I'd built up through yoga and exercise, which now allowed me to lift her and carry her to the car.\n\nThe hospital was a flurry of sterile smells and worried faces, but my focus was solely on my mother's well-being. I quickly settled her into the backseat and drove, my mind racing with worry. At the hospital, I rushed to get her help, calling out to the doctors as they quickly gathered around. Soon, a rolling bed appeared, and my mother was whisked away for immediate attention. I was left to sit, my anxiety simmering just below the surface.\n\nAs it turned out, my mother had slipped off a step stool while trying to retrieve a vase from the highest cabinet. It was a simple misstep, but one that had sent her tumbling to the ground.",
            "It's a well-established fact that embracing the Mediterranean Diet, characterized by its emphasis on plant-based foods, monounsaturated fats, and moderate alcohol intake, can have a profound impact on our health. In fact, a plethora of studies have demonstrated that adhering to this diet can significantly reduce the risk of chronic heart disease and stroke. The study in question sheds light on the relationship between adherence to the \"Mediterranean Diet\" and the risk of heart-related issues, specifically chronic heart disease, stroke, and stroke mortality.\n\nIn essence, the Mediterranean Diet is a modified version of its precursor, with a greater focus on consuming plant-based proteins like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, while minimizing animal products and saturated fats. The results of prior studies have been promising, showcasing the diet's effectiveness in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. However, research has been lacking in the area of stroke and stroke mortality.\n\nOur investigation involved analyzing data from the Nurses' Health Study, which included 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, with no prior history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Over a period of 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, we computed an \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\" based on self-reported food frequency questionnaires. These questionnaires underwent validation studies to ensure accuracy. We also accounted for various lifestyle factors, including body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and leisure-time physical activity.\n\nTo minimize random variation and better represent long-term dietary habits, we calculated cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated questionnaires. We adjusted for potential confounders like age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use. Our analysis revealed that a higher aMed diet score was associated with a lower risk of heart disease and stroke in the study participants. Specifically, women with the highest aMed quintile had a 29% lower risk of chronic heart disease and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile.",
            "Fast forward to 2007, and it seemed like the world had hit rock bottom. The United States of America found itself in the midst of a devastating financial crisis. Joblessness skyrocketed, the housing market imploded, and many of America's largest corporations were left reeling. The question on everyone's lips was: how did this catastrophe unfold, and how can we prevent it from happening again? To put it bluntly, the financial crisis was the result of reckless and naive policy decisions that forced banks and firms to dispense sub-prime loans into a fragile financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were coerced into underwriting and repackaging these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were left scrambling for capital, and the chaos was transferred to the repackaged mortgages they'd sold, and ultimately, the entire economy.\n\nLooking back, the roots of the crisis stretch as far back as 1999, during the Clinton administration. The President was eager to secure a second term, and his team relaxed lending restrictions to boost his popularity. This move set the stage for the impending sub-prime crisis seven years later. In 1999, Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported on the pressure being felt by Fannie Mae, the nation's largest home mortgage underwriter, to offer loans to low- and moderate-income individuals. The government-subsidized corporation was also under pressure to maintain its rapid profit growth. Holmes astutely foresaw the consequences of these actions, warning of a potential government rescue similar to the savings and loan industry debacle of the 1980s. As we now know, ill-advised lending would ultimately lead to a catastrophic economic meltdown.\n\nA perfect storm of factors contributed to the economic freefall, including the complex and convoluted nature of modern mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were all extensively used in the years leading up to the crisis, intertwining various sectors of the economy with the housing market. U.S. households and financial markets as a whole became over-leveraged in the housing market, leaving them vulnerable to even the slightest price fluctuations.\n\nThe housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had invested in these mortgage-backed securities were left reeling. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, which accounted for approximately 30% of the country's GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at fire-sale prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to transition to commercial banks subject to intense regulatory oversight. Fannie and Freddie were in $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "I'll never forget that notorious section of my story where I'm tempted to unleash a torrent of exposition, stretching my writer's wings to impress, but often ending up putting my readers to sleep or sending them fleeing in frustration.  Dr. Merlin has been known to slam her monitor in exasperation when she finds herself stuck in a sea of Too Much Information, and I'm talking the not-very-fun kind.\n\nExposition is the enemy of a good story.\n\nMy fellow writers already know the age-old adage, \"Show, don't tell,\" but I still find myself succumbing to lengthy passages where nothing happens or, worse, too much happens.  Exposition is that pesky inner voice urging me to tell the reader everything, from the history to the minutest details, to get to the good stuff (not to be confused with the inner voice whispering to reveal every character's backstory, no matter how insignificant).\n\nExposition is essentially regaling the audience with a straightforward account of what's happening, often in dry prose.  In film, this plays out when one character unloads a wealth of information on another, à la \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nLet's take an example.  When reading a story, I'm informed that the heroine met her beloved at a specific time and place, got married in a grand celebration, and witnessed her husband's tragic murder.  I wouldn't expect this entire sequence to take up two pages, with both characters only getting a few lines of dialogue.  I'd expect the author to spend some time developing the husband's character, showing through his words and actions how deeply he adored his wife, and I'd expect the heroine to reveal, through her thoughts and actions, how his presence enriched her life.  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow me to become emotionally invested in his fate and gain insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, the depth of their bond, and clues about her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams reflected through his eyes.  I'd mourn his loss with her, growing more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, I'd expect more substance behind the bare bones of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, it's my job to provide that substance.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, and presses on*)  Sometimes it's tempting to rush past certain details.  Perhaps I'm introducing a new character with a storied past: he used to be in the Air Force, now runs the night shift at a gas station, has been married twice, has no kids, loves fishing on weekends, secretly dreams of owning the station someday, and starts his day with Eggs Benedict.",
            "I caught two local broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio, the first of which was NBC 4's live newscast on August 13, 2011. The leading story was about a heinous crime: a man named Shad Hostettler had stabbed his wife, though her name wasn't mentioned. They aired his mugshot, and he looked like the embodiment of pure evil. The news team devoted about two minutes to the story, which was still unfolding. I think they allocated an adequate amount of airtime to this distressing event. \n\nThe next story was about an early morning shooting involving 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically injured, and no arrests had been made or suspects identified at the time. The SWAT team was on the scene, investigating the crime. This story seemed rather rushed, and I suspect it might have been due to the fact that the victim was a black man from a predominantly black neighborhood. It's a phenomenon I've observed for years: when minorities are victims of a crime, they often get shortchanged in the news coverage. In contrast, if a white child or adult is kidnapped or a victim of a crime, the media goes into overdrive; but when it's a minority person, they're lucky if they get a mention.\n\nThe next story dealt with a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. The news team provided details about the possible location of the incident, and it was determined that a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle had hit the aircraft. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for any information leading to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nThe next story focused on the impending rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They mentioned that the temperatures would remain in the mid-to-low eighties for the weekend. The brief length of this story was likely due to the anchor wanting to use it as a teaser to keep viewers engaged.\n\nThey also covered a story about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The perpetrator was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt and estimated to be around six feet tall and 150 pounds. I found it peculiar that they devoted so much attention to his racial description and how dark he was.\n\nAnother story was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas-based marijuana kingpin who had conspired to distribute large quantities of the substance to Ohio. One thing that caught my attention was that instead of stating his 25-year prison sentence, they mentioned \"300 months.\" I'm not sure if they thought that made it sound harsher or if it was just a stylistic choice. They also highlighted that he was a Hispanic man, but I'm not convinced it was relevant to the story.",
            "There's a mystique surrounding brotherhood - an unbreakable bond that defies time and circumstance. Within its depths, a complex tapestry of emotions unfolds: love, pride, jealousy, cruelty, and more. Brothers have a unique understanding of one another, a connection that transcends the shallow relationships we form with others. When you look at your brother, you see a reflection of yourself, a truth that becomes glaringly evident in the most trying of times. This bond isn't always easy to navigate, and the emotions that accompany it come with a steep price. Understanding this fraternal link requires embracing the consequences that follow, and it's only when we can gaze into our brother's eyes that we truly see ourselves - not as others perceive us, but as we truly are. Our actions and their aftermath reveal our character, a truth that's difficult to confront but essential to growth.\n\nThe novel \"The Scarlet Ibis\" masterfully explores this theme, weaving a story of two brothers who navigate the intricate web of emotions tied to their bond. Against the backdrop of a lush, vivid landscape, these two boys embark on a futile journey, their relationship marked by bitter disappointment and intense pride. The climactic scene is a poignant example of this complex dynamic, and only one brother emerges unscathed. Through the protagonist's direct characterization and his interactions with his brother, as well as the narrator's nuanced perspective, we gain insight into the complex feelings that shape the protagonist's world and inform his actions.\n\nAt its core, the protagonist's actions are driven by one dominant emotion: pride. From their early adventures together to their final, fateful excursion, he grapples with resentment towards his little brother, Doodle. The protagonist had envisioned a brother who could share in his passions, a companion to explore the world with. He dreamed of racing to Horsehead Landing, perching in the top fork of the great pine, and learning the skills he'd mastered through trial and error. But Doodle's fragile health makes such exploits impossible, crushing the protagonist's fantasies and leaving him feeling bereft. The depth of his disappointment is evident in his disturbing thoughts of suffocating his brother, a bleak testament to the darkness that can lurk beneath the surface of even the most loving relationships. Yet, when Doodle smiles, the protagonist's heart softens, revealing a glimmer of hope and a love that's hard to deny. This dichotomy speaks to the complexity of brotherly love, a bond that's both beautiful and fraught with challenges.",
            "We're constantly amazed by the intricate complexity of the human brain, that unpredictable and creative information-processing machine. As technology has evolved from its humble beginnings to the modern era, so too have the metaphors used to describe our brains. We've seen it likened to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, a book, and most recently, a computer - each era's comparison shedding light on some aspect of its function. However, it's essential to remember that these analogies are helpful but limited, and can lead to misconceptions if taken too literally.\n\nWhen it comes to processing information, it all starts with the sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, or light into electrical signals. These signals are continually transformed by the brain's algorithms through both bottom-up and top-down processing. To illustrate this, imagine looking at a picture of a black box against a white background. Bottom-up processing involves breaking down the image into basic components like color and orientation, ultimately determining that you're seeing a box. Meanwhile, top-down processing uses the results of earlier steps to speed up your recognition of the object, helping you decide whether it's a box or a hole in the background.\n\nAs information is processed to a certain point, an attention filter kicks in, deciding which signals are most important and which cognitive processes they should be routed to. For example, you may process every blade of grass when you glance down at your shoes, but your attention filter helps you tune them out. Conversely, you might pick out your name in a noisy room. This process repeats at various stages, with the results of processing influenced by attention at each step.\n\nBefore the brain can process information, it must first store it. There are three primary types of memory: sensory, working, and long-term. Information is first encoded, and different types of encoding suit different sensory stimuli. When it comes to verbal input, for instance, it can be encoded based on its structural appearance, phonetic sound, or semantic meaning. Once stored, information must be maintained, and research suggests that working memory, which holds information for about 20 seconds, relies on an electrical signal looping through a specific series of neurons for a short time. Long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are numerous theories about how knowledge is organized within the brain, each with its unique perspective. Some are based on how humans retrieve memories, while others draw from computer science and neurophysiology. One such model is the semantic network, which proposes that concepts are represented by nodes and linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, the concept of \"chair\" might be connected to \"table,\" which in turn is linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley's dystopian novel, Brave New World, serves as a scathing critique of the impending dangers of unchecked technological advancement and the capitalist system that perpetuates it. The novel depicts a society where people value collectivity above individuality, with its citizens conditioned from a young age to prioritize immediate gratification above all else. The characters are unwitting pawns in a grand game, trapped within a narrow ideology dictated by the all-powerful World Controller. When viewed through the lens of Marxist ideology, Huxley's work reveals a deep-seated distrust of the emerging economic systems of his time.\n\nOne of the primary targets of Huxley's satire is the capitalist system, which is reflected in his use of Marxist concepts such as homogeny and reification. These terms highlight the ways in which capitalist systems can lead to the suppression of individuality and the uniformity of the masses. The novel's depiction of the lower classes, known as Deltas and Gammas, is particularly telling, as they are conditioned to prioritize consumption and indulgence above all else, thanks to the pervasive use of hypnopædia. This manipulation is masterminded by the World Controller, who maintains a stranglehold on the lower classes through ideological control.\n\nThe concept of hegemony – where a dominant group exercises control over a subordinate group – is also evident in Brave New World. The upper classes, comprising Alphas and Betas, are born with the knowledge of this manipulation but do little to challenge it, further solidifying the grip of capitalism on the society. The novel's portrayal of relationships between characters is also noteworthy, as they are superficial and lack depth. This may suggest that the rise of technology and capitalism has stripped individuals of their free will and emotional expression, reducing love and other intense emotions to mere surface-level interactions.\n\nThe novel's characters often focus on physical appearance, with men commenting on women's physical attributes and women discussing their romantic conquests with little shame. This limited emotional landscape serves as a commentary on the socioeconomic effects of capitalism, where individuals are content with their place in the hierarchy and conform to societal expectations. Their unwavering obedience to the status quo is a testament to Marxist theories on the proletariat, who are conditioned to believe in their own superiority as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform to the norms of their peers.",
            "It's been about two and a half years since I stepped onto the University Park campus, and four and a half semesters of navigating its twists and turns have taught me that getting around can be a real challenge. As a freshman, I was stuck in an East Halls dorm room, the farthest I could get from the action without venturing onto the stadium or Bryce Jordan Center grounds. Commuting from Stuart Hall to classes in buildings like Willard, smack in the center of campus, was a 25-minute trek – and that was on a good day, weather permitting. But I've learned that it wasn't always this way. I spoke with an alum not much older than myself, who shared that the East Halls used to be isolated from the rest of the campus by a massive expanse of unused land. Fast-forward to today, and that open space has been transformed into sports fields, sleek new buildings like the Creamery and health services center, and rows of apartments. As the campus continues to sprawl, getting from one place to another is becoming increasingly difficult.\n\nThat's when I realized the obvious solution – the humble bicycle. But it's not just about having a bike; students need to actually ride them, and the campus needs to be designed with cyclists in mind. I chatted with a friend who'd taken a several-year break from biking, only to rediscover its joys. \"Bikes are the way to go,\" he said. \"For a while, it wasn't cool to ride, but it's the only way to get around.\" Not only is biking great exercise, but it's also the most efficient way to travel. With a hearty bowl of oatmeal and a bit of effort, you can cover 30 miles or more. As an off-campus student, I now live just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. Buying a bike was one of the smartest decisions I made this year. Classes in Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from my place, are a breeze to get to on two wheels – just 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The problem is, Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas, isn't always a bike-friendly stretch. Walking, on the other hand, is a viable option, but with my schedule, I just don't have the time. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option, sucking up an extra 30-40 minutes of my day – over two and a half hours every week. That's time I just can't afford to spare."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",

Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

My values align with this field in a big way: service, respect, and a strong sense of ethics are non-negotiables for me. I'm also committed to helping others, whether it's building strong relationships within families or pushing myself to stay ahead of the curve in this ever-evolving field.\n\nLooking back, I've always wanted to use my skills to help others, but I wasn't sure where to start.

Even after graduation from Piedmont College in 2009, I remained unsure of my path. But everything changed on a summer day when a friend introduced me to a 16-year-old kid who was desperate to escape his abusive parents.

            "Insomnia: A Multifaceted Disorder at the Convergence of Biology and Culture\n\nThis paper delves into the complex world of insomnia, a sleep disorder that has been extensively studied through the lenses of both biological and sociocultural models. The biological model focuses on the genetic and physiological underpinnings of insomnia, while the sociocultural model examines the environmental and social factors that contribute to the disorder. This review aims to explore the relationship between these two models, highlighting the key research findings and their implications for understanding insomnia.\n\nInsomnia can manifest in various forms, including primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders linked to mental health issues, and sleep disorders caused by medical complications or substance intake. The primary sleep disorders include Dyssonmias, such as Primary Insomnia and Primary Hypersomnia, as well as Parasomnias, which involve behavioral abnormalities and physiological occurrences during sleep. In this review, we will focus primarily on insomnia and, to some extent, on the broader category of primary sleep disorders.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes the role of genetics, heritable factors, and physiological mechanisms in the development of insomnia. Research has shown that neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice found that the presence of phenotypic GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons is essential for sleep-wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while its inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and increased sleep. The GABAB agonist, baclofen, has been shown to increase sleep time in mice, suggesting a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. This finding implies that alterations in this receptor could impact an individual's ability to achieve adequate sleep without medication, with potential consequences for daily life, including academic, professional, and mundane tasks.\n\nThe sociocultural implications of this study are significant, as the inheritance of this phenotype could regulate sleep patterns and an alteration of the receptor could naturally disrupt sleep. This, in turn, could negatively impact various aspects of life, including school, career, and daily events that require sustained focus and attention. By examining the intersection of biology and culture, we gain a deeper understanding of the complex factors contributing to insomnia and its far-reaching consequences.",
            "The following is a comprehensive overview of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), a condition that has quietly wreaked havoc on the lives of many. To begin, let's define CAPD. Simply put, it's a disorder where the central nervous system, the command center of our being, has trouble processing auditory information. Don't get me wrong – people with CAPD can hear just fine; it's just that their brain has a hard time making sense of what they hear. Imagine trying to tune into your favorite radio station, only to have the static overwhelm the music – that's essentially what's happening in the brains of those with CAPD. \n\nThe history of CAPD dates back to the 1950s, when researchers first started studying children with communication disorders. The term \"auditory imperception\" was coined back then, and since then, we've made significant progress in understanding this complex condition. In the 1960s, scientists like Kimura made groundbreaking discoveries about the way our brains process sound, paving the way for the development of tests that could help diagnose CAPD.\n\nSo, what does CAPD look like in real life? It can manifest in a variety of ways, from difficulty localizing sounds to trouble distinguishing between different speech patterns. For example, someone with CAPD might struggle to pick up on sarcasm or have trouble following a conversation in a noisy environment. It's like trying to decipher a code that's constantly shifting. Other signs include trouble filtering out background noise or distinguishing between multiple sounds at the same time.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD is no simple task. It requires a comprehensive evaluation, often involving a team of experts, including audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists. They'll use a range of tests to assess auditory skills, including behavioral observations and questionnaires. There's no single \"magic test\" that can diagnose CAPD, and the exact cause remains a mystery. However, by understanding the complexities of CAPD, we can better support those affected and help them navigate a world that's often overwhelming.\n\nAs a teacher in a mainstream classroom, what can you do to help a student with CAPD thrive?

            "Twelfth Night seems to suggest that donning a disguise can lead to deception, but ultimately, it's crucial to shed that false persona or risk losing one's true self. However, abandoning the charade can result in isolation, as it's a delicate balancing act between self-preservation and maintaining relationships with others. The reactions of those around you can be unpredictable, ranging from indifference to outrage, especially when it comes to deception in matters of gender identity. \n\nThis dilemma is particularly complex when it comes to gender role reversal, as it raises questions about the underlying motivations behind the disguise. In the case of Viola, her decision to pose as a man seems to be driven by a desire for self-protection. As she navigates this new environment, her disguise helps her avoid potential threats, but it also creates a disconnect from her support system and forces her to conceal her true feelings.\n\nViola's ruse is so convincing that Olivia becomes infatuated with her, further complicating matters. Viola's interactions with Orsino also raise questions about her own suppressed emotions, as she's forced to confront her feelings of unrequited love. Some may see this as a progressive exploration of repressed desires, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. The text hints that their emotions may be repressed, and the appearance of Viola/Cesario serves as a catalyst for their self-discovery.\n\nHowever, this interpretation is nuanced, and it's hard to say whether Olivia's feelings for Cesario are genuine or a product of societal norms. Her swift rejection of Cesario and subsequent acceptance of Sebastian as a family member suggest that she's more interested in appearance than substance. This raises questions about the nature of attraction and the societal pressures that shape our desires.",
            "The brutality of German colonial rule has been well-documented, particularly in its treatment of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, the German colonial empire was a complex entity with a diverse array of policies and ruling styles that varied across its territories. This was also reflected in the provision of education, which differed greatly from one colony to another. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a population of educated and literate Africans, which was a far cry from the situation in other colonies. \n\nIn contrast, South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark picture. Unlike East Africa, where the government took a proactive role in establishing state schools and educating the locals, the task of native education in South West Africa was largely left to missionary societies that received limited support from the government. However, the government did invest heavily in the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing state schools and regulating missionary schools to a greater extent. This dichotomy in educational policies had a lasting impact on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, the overwhelming majority of the population in South West Africa remained uneducated and illiterate. Various factors, including social, political, and economic, contributed to this divergent experience.\n\nDespite a wealth of literature on education in the German colonial empire, much of it is in German and deals with the early twentieth century. These studies were primarily focused on describing the educational systems in the colonies. Later works written in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies and in-depth analyses of specific aspects of education, highlighting the differences between various colonies. One of the most notable works on this topic is Cohen's study, which compared the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa and shed light on the factors that led to their differences. Cohen attributes the distinguishing features of South West Africa's educational system to the large settler population.\n\nSouth West Africa stood out among Germany's colonies due to its relatively temperate climate, albeit largely arid desert in some areas. The European population in the colony reflected this, with nearly 15,000 whites residing in South West Africa by 1913, compared to around 5,336 in East Africa, which had the next largest settler population.",
            "It's been a century since popular music exploded onto the scene, and in that time, it's branched out into an astonishing array of genres that's left us all scratching our heads trying to keep up. I mean, who can keep track of all the sub and sub-sub genres within genres like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk? The sheer number of them is mind-boggling. But if I had to pick one genre that's evolved into a behemoth, it's heavy metal rock, which has become the most diverse and expressive genre of all over the past four decades.\n\nWhat sets heavy metal apart is its incredible range of emotions, with a dark and brooding tone that often leans towards the heavier side of the emotional spectrum. And it's not just the music itself - it's the people who make it, too. As soon as heavy metal started gaining traction, musicians began experimenting with it, pushing the boundaries and creating their own sub-genres, which in turn spawned even more sub-sub-genres. It's a never-ending chain of innovation and creativity that continues to this day.\n\nFast-forward to today, and we're faced with an overwhelming array of heavy metal niches that make it hard to pin down exactly what heavy metal is. It's like trying to capture a wild animal - it's constantly evolving, incorporating elements from other genres, and adapting to new influences. But at its core, heavy metal is a movement, not just a genre. So, what is it, exactly?\n\nAt its heart, heavy metal is a movement defined by darkness - a sonic reflection of our deepest, most primal emotions. It's a music of excess - more bass, more volume, more violence, and more theatricality. It's an art form that demands skill, with musicians who can really play their instruments and make it shine through in their music. And, as you might expect, it's also a movement that's deeply tied to the world of substances - the psychedelic magic of the 1970s gave birth to some truly groundbreaking music, as musicians used their experiences with psychedelics as a catalyst for creativity.\n\nHeavy metal's visceral qualities are unmistakable - a raw, unbridled energy that's never been seen before in popular music. It's drawn inspiration from the darkest corners of the human experience, as well as from the Romantic Era's emphasis on emotion and drama. Take, for example, the lyrics of Helter Skelter, a song that's often cited as one of the first heavy metal tracks. It's a brooding, intense piece that captures the highs and lows of the psychedelic experience - and it's a nod to the darker side of the Beatles' sound, which was responding to the Rolling Stones' own darker tone. It's a testament to the power of heavy metal to push boundaries and challenge the status quo.",
            "Several decades before the Surrealist artists began conjuring up their dreamlike works, Henri Rousseau was meticulously crafting his own dreams – both figuratively and literally. His 1910 masterpiece, 'The Dream', not only depicts a woman lost in awe of the wonders she discovers in her dream world but also serves as a reflection of Rousseau's own aspirations as a painter. For years, he had fantasized about receiving recognition, acceptance, and admiration from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, but this dream came with a daunting internal conflict: should he conform to the established styles of painting to gain approval from the art world he idolized, or should he take the road less traveled and forge his own unique path?\n\nBefore delving into the world of 'The Dream', it's essential to grasp Rousseau's personal story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France, Rousseau came from a family that enjoyed a comfortable, middle-class lifestyle. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer, and although Rousseau received no formal art training, he worked as a gabelou, or municipal toll service employee, for 40 years. The misnomer 'douanier', or customs inspector, followed him throughout his early career. The tragic loss of his first wife, Clémence, and their eight infant children left Rousseau with his young daughter Julia and overwhelming grief. Painting became his solace, allowing him to escape into a new life. Unlike his contemporaries, who romanticized the peasant class in their art, Rousseau, a folk painter, drew from the everyday experiences of his own class.\n\nRousseau's yearning for acceptance in the art world is understandable, given his unconventional background and late start in his career. As he began producing art at the same time as other talented and renowned modern artists, he didn't receive the recognition he deserved until the emergence of fellow artist Matisse. According to art historian Jan Gordon, the two artists, while competitors in the art world, differed not only in style and subject matter but also in their motivations. While Matisse sought to avoid painting in a clichéd manner, Rousseau aspired to create conventional works that would earn him a place among the esteemed Artiste Français.",
            "A profound connection has long been perceived between ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. As I ponder this, I'm reminded of John Keats' timeless words in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" where he asserts, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty— That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" It's almost as if we're wired to appreciate ethics and aesthetics without needing explicit instruction or education. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe rather than dictate; we study morality and beauty to decipher what makes a piece of art or literature beautiful or an action moral, rather than establishing set rules for evaluating or creating great art or behavior.\n\nTo put it bluntly, no amount of criticism or analysis can fully grasp the essence of what's good or beautiful. Discussing the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might revolve around aspects like composition, context, or symbolism, but these don't really capture why it's a masterpiece. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often respond with something like, \"There's just something about it\" before elaborating on the subtleties. I believe that both art and ethics can't be reduced to a mere description of their attributes. Flannery O'Connor's insight, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way,\" resonates with me. No matter how thoroughly we dissect a work of literature, there's always a lingering, ineffable quality that remains. Similarly, ethics has this enigmatic quality, as Wittgenstein suggests, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\"\n\nThis transcendent nature of both ethics and aesthetics is what ties them together in my mind. I propose that it's this elusive \"something\" – this je ne sais quoi – that makes art and morality so powerful. This connection point between them is further strengthened when we consider literature, which impacts us on a deeply personal level, though it's impossible to fully articulate. As McKean astutely observes, \"What most distinguishes literature from other arts, what is unique about it, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are less relevant to other arts, like music, but they seem as pertinent to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "As I gaze upon the contemporary Germany, it's undeniable that this country is a powerhouse, a fusion of unique cultures from the shadows of the Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. The same cultural heartbeat can be felt from Cologne along the Rhine River, right through the nucleus of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden, nestled on the Elbe River. Given its distinct culture, it's no wonder that modern-day Germany, as we know it, is an amalgamation of various sources and tribes. \n\nGermany's ancestral roots, known as Germania, have been a topic of heated debate among scholars and historians. The origins of the name are shrouded in mystery, with some attributing it to a Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, who were allegedly referred to as Germans prior to their crossing of the Rhine and battling the Gaulish forces, as described by Tacitus. On the other hand, Julius Caesar first used the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, where he clashed with Germanic tribes that frequently crossed the Rhine under dubious pretenses. Caesar borrowed the term from the Gauls themselves, using it to distinguish between the conquered Gauls and the unconquered Germanic tribes. In his first book on the Gallic Wars, Julius Caesar notes, \"The Germans, who reside beyond the Rhine, are constantly at war with the Gauls... They engage in almost daily battles with the Germans.\" Others propose that the name might be derived from the Gaulish language, referring to a neighboring tribe. Yet another theory suggests that it originated from the spear used in warfare, known as a \"ger\" (Oxford English Dictionary, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating that the Germans were loud and boisterous.\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus, in his AD 98 writing \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" penned a vivid account of the origins of the Germans, stating, \"I consider the Germans to be aboriginal, with no significant intermingling with other races through immigration or cultural exchange. Why would anyone leave Asia, Africa, or Italy for Germany, with its rugged landscape, inclement weather, and stern demeanor, unless it was their homeland?\" (Tacitus, 98) It's unlikely that the Romans would have voluntarily left their empire to settle in Germania, at least not yet. Instead, they would send expeditions into Germania to acquire goods and resources, and occasionally lead military campaigns, but ultimately return to their vast empire. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they resided on the periphery of the Roman Empire, trading their goods and skills by serving in the Roman army (Ozment, 2005, p. 17).",
            "I stood frozen, my mind a complete blank slate gazing at the scene before me. It was as if I'd entered a state of numbness, a practiced detachment that allowed me to observe without judgment or emotional response. Thoughts whizzed in and out of my head in rapid succession, leaving behind a trail of mental fragments that refused to coalesce into anything tangible. My consciousness was in a state of fluid motion, effortlessly processing the visual stimuli in front of me without the burden of abstract thoughts.\n\nI'd once taken art lessons from a talented artist, who recommended I read 'The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.' The book promised to unlock the secrets of perception and artistic expression, and I'd been fascinated by drawing since I was a six-year-old. The technique that resonated with me was the art of framing – literally placing a mental border around the subject, stripping away extraneous details to reveal the essence. It was a fundamental lesson in simplifying complexity.\n\nAt that moment, I couldn't shake off the feeling of being overwhelmed by the mess in front of me. A wealth of sensory information bombarded my senses, refusing to allow me to mentally impose the artist's frame. It was as if I was staring at a kaleidoscope of colors, textures, and shapes, with no clear focal point. Picasso's blue period, Monet's love of greenery, and the Italian Renaissance masters' use of vibrant colors all flashed through my mind, but I couldn't muster the confidence to claim my own artistic vision.\n\nMy fingers instinctively reached for the pencil, and with a surge of creative energy, I began to sketch. My hand moved with a life of its own, as if channeling the pure creative energy at its core. Water swirled, serene and smooth, like a fleeting moment of beauty. But in a sudden, jarring shift, my hand smacked the toilet handle once more, and I was left staring at the same stubborn, brown, and uncooperative package. It was a far cry from the art that had begun to unfurl in my mind's eye.\n\nWith a deep breath, I gripped the mop, set my feet shoulder-width apart, and stared at the offending mess. A faint scowl creased my brow as I pondered the carelessness of the person who'd left this mess. My hand moved toward the wall, grasping the toilet paper, and I deliberately stilled my thoughts, ready to confront the unglamorous task at hand. I dipped my hand slowly into the bowl, the unexpected intimacy of the moment a fleeting echo of a creative spark that seemed to have abandoned me.",
            "Thanks be to the statistics.  For the past few years, we've all witnessed the alarming rise in teenage fatalities behind the wheel. Several factors converge to create this tragic trend among the youngest American drivers. The National Institutes of Health reveal that one aspect of the problem lies in the teen brain's inability to handle the perils of driving. Inexperience is another elephant in the room, causing not only deadly crashes but also a higher rate of rollovers, speeding, and vehicles veering off the road.\n\nThe statistics are even more disturbing when considering the presence of peer passengers. It's a well-known fact that teens often travel with friends, but a study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center highlights a striking correlation: the more youthful the passenger, the greater the risk of traffic accidents.\n\nIn an effort to mitigate this issue, California and other states have implemented provisional driver's licenses, limiting the hours teens can drive and prohibiting other minors as passengers. However, in my opinion, these measures are merely band-aids on a much larger problem. The real issue is that, as a group, the youngest drivers are statistically incapable of adequately managing the risks and responsibilities associated with driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman agrees, suggesting that 18 is still too young for a full driver's license. His research indicates that those under 19-20 years old have a strong desire to take risks for the thrill of it, making it sensible to delay driving until this tendency subsides.\n\nIf we continue to issue driver's licenses to young teens, we'll not only see more fatal accidents but the death toll will likely skyrocket in the next few years. By 2010, the Baby Boomer generation's children will come of age and millions of new teen drivers will flood the roads. \n\nImplementing legislation to address this issue would be straightforward. Schools could continue to offer driver's education classes to initiate the learning process, but no one under 18 should be allowed to operate a vehicle. A provisional permit could still be issued before a full driver's license, with a specified number of practical driving hours required. This number could be based on the hours already mandated by most states (for instance, California requires 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult). Uniform, national legislation on this matter would be a reasonable and effective way to safeguard teens across the country.\n\nThis proposed legislation is far from novel – it's a long-overdue solution to a pressing problem.",
            "Browsing through the Library of Congress's archives, I stumbled upon the early Edison films and decided to give them all a watch. I was particularly drawn to the trick films – there were fifteen of them, hailing from 1895 to 1901. As I delved into these films, I discovered that they relied on creative editing to create illusions. My analysis mainly focused on dissecting the poetic techniques used in most of these trick films and identifying the innovative characteristics that emerged in a few of the later ones. The trick films of the time were largely confined to a set-bound format, shot within a frontal proscenium, utilized long and medium shots, and stuck to the rule of one shot equals one film.\n\nHowever, there were a few daring films at the turn of the century that broke free from these conventions by introducing new elements such as multiple shots. One thing that stood out about these trick films was their consistent use of an interior set within a frontal proscenium frame. The camera remained stationary, refusing to pan or zoom in on the action. This composition was a common trait of early films, drawing inspiration from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. As a result, figures in these trick films were limited in their movement, typically moving side-to-side rather than forward or backward. A classic example can be seen in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where the actors enter from the right side and move horizontally along the frame, only to disappear from view without the camera following them.\n\nThe use of the frontal proscenium style also led to a reliance on long shots and, occasionally, medium shots. Close-ups were a rarity in these trick films, adhering to the theatre and vaudeville tradition where the audience would see the entire performance within the frame. Since the actors remained in the middle ground, close-ups were never a possibility. In most early trick films, one conceptually cohesive shot equaled one physical film, limiting their length to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. This also restricted the use of tricks in storytelling, as most focused on short, vaudeville-style illusions like magic, disappearing acts, and switching tricks with minimal narrative. However, it's worth noting that in a trick film, a single \"shot\" can actually be composed of multiple joined shots to create an illusion of apparition or disappearance. Take The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) for example – a closer examination reveals the moment when the physical shot of Mary's severed \"head\" begins, despite the entire film being conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a true blue advocate for the Republican cause. Though his primary occupation as an agriculturalist and his brief stint in politics didn't quite add up to a long resume, they did cement his reputation as a steadfast champion of personal freedom and government restraint. His passion for an agrarian way of life was the backbone of his stance on governance, and his devotion to this cause colored his opinions on autonomy, constitutionalism, and the judicial system. He firmly believed that the United States had a unique opportunity to create a utopian system, unencumbered by the baggage of a native tradition, allowing the nation's founders to establish a system of self-governance that truly represented the people.\n\nTo Taylor, the natural rights of man were sacrosanct, and he believed that they were all interconnected - that if one right was denied, the value of the others would be diminished. He argued that these rights should be beyond the reach of the government, which he saw as prone to abuse by those with physical prowess and malicious intent. In his view, the so-called \"state of nature\" was a harsh reality, but one that should be mitigated by the establishment of a civilization that valued fairness and justice over might and greed.\n\nTo achieve this ideal society, Taylor believed that a government must be constructed to account for the dual nature of humanity - both good and evil. He was unwavering in his conviction that government would always reflect the virtues and vices of its people. According to him, good principles were those that protected private property, fostered agriculture, and discouraged unchecked capitalism, and a government founded on these principles would function equitably, regardless of who was at the helm. However, self-interest, which he saw as the driving force behind human behavior, was only a problem when it prioritized individual gain over the common good.\n\nTaylor, like many of his fellow Republicans, was a staunch advocate for a strict construction of the Constitution, with a Federal government that possessed only the powers explicitly granted to it by the document. He believed that a limited government was inherently more efficient and less prone to tyranny, but also warned that a literal interpretation of the Constitution without regard for its original intent was a recipe for disaster. Furthermore, he saw the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, as it more explicitly enshrined the sovereignty of individual states rather than a unified nation.",
            "Looking at Figure 17, we noticed a dramatic decline in commuter log submissions in the third month of our project. It was a bit disheartening and we're still trying to figure out what caused it. Winter is probably to blame, at least in part, as folks on our New England campus are less likely to bike or walk during the cold months. Then there's the end of the fall semester, which keeps everyone busy with schoolwork, grades, and more, making it easy to overlook the commuter log. The holiday season also sets in around December, with a long break for students and faculty, so it's no surprise that many people don't need to come to campus that month. We do see a lull in activity after the break, which resumes in late January. But, we still can't explain the low number of submissions in February. Perhaps it's just the natural ebb and flow of a project, where the initial excitement eventually wears off. To combat this, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a special campaign that got people back on board and resulted in a spike in log submissions that month. Our challenge, however, was to maintain momentum despite the inevitable decrease in engagement, as well as the holiday and semester breaks that come with higher education. \n\nAnother obstacle we faced (and one that's inherent in any alternative commuting project) is that people love the freedom, independence, and flexibility that comes with driving their own cars. It's deeply ingrained in our culture, making it essential to offer incentives for switching to alternative modes of transportation. We offered a range of prizes, from gift certificates to local restaurants and coffee shops to massages and bookstore discounts. It would have been interesting to see how bigger prizes, like a nice bicycle or a hybrid car, might have affected participation. Perhaps if we'd offered increasingly valuable prizes throughout the project, we could have prevented that dip in engagement. Our prize offerings remained the same throughout, but if we'd announced bigger and better prizes, like a bicycle in December and a hybrid car in January, we might have seen participation and engagement increase instead of decrease.",
            "I'm still getting used to the wild world of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), but one thing's for sure - they're a game-changer. Essentially, an ETF is like a security that tracks an index, commodity, or basket of assets, just like an index fund, but with a twist: it trades like a stock on an exchange. This means you get the benefits of diversification, like owning a piece of every stock in the fund, without the hassle of individually managing each one. Plus, you can sell short, buy on margin, or even purchase as few as a single share in any transaction. And the best part? The expense ratios of ETFs are often significantly lower than those of the average mutual fund. However, there are some downsides to consider, such as paying a commission on each trade, just like when buying or selling individual stocks. \n\nBut with the sheer variety of ETFs available, it can be overwhelming to choose the right one. That's why it's essential for savvy investors to evaluate whether the touted benefits, like diversification, actually live up to the hype. In this case, we're taking a closer look at the ETF IHF and comparing it to its top 10 holdings to see if owning a single ETF is worth it. We'll also examine whether a portfolio of these 10 stocks can provide similar benefits to a diversified portfolio of the same stocks. To keep things manageable, we're focusing on the top 10 holdings, which account for a whopping 63.58% of the ETF's assets.\n\nTo gauge how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF as a whole, we've calculated their contributions to the portfolio's beta and return, assuming a portfolio made up entirely of these stocks in the same proportions as the ETF. The results are telling: a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings would yield a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. What's more, the beta of this portfolio is 0.12 lower than the ETF's, suggesting a potentially more stable investment. However, there's a chance that these results might not be statistically significant.\n\nTo get a better understanding of the data, we've also calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100% to compare them to the ETF IHF. This will give us insight into the potential risks and rewards of investing in these stocks, and whether a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings is a viable alternative to the ETF.",
            "I've always been fascinated by Edgar Allan Poe's \"Dream-Land,\" one of his self-proclaimed masterpieces. The poem's use of the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56 is particularly intriguing. My research led me to Virgil, who first used the term to describe an island north of Britain, believed to be the edge of the known world. However, there's a more contemporary source that sheds light on Poe's familiarity with German authors. Poe was indeed enamored with Goethe's writing.\n\nThis connection is significant because it highlights Poe's influence from Goethe. As Karl J. Arndt notes in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" Poe's poem bears a striking resemblance to Goethe's work, suggesting that Poe may have been drawing inspiration from the German author. \n\nOxford Companion to English Literature credits Goethe as a celebrated writer of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" which was published in two parts, with the first installment coming out in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe's passing. Within the second part of \"Faust,\" there's a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem tells the story of a king whose wife gives him a goblet before her untimely death. The king's descent into grief and despair is marked by excessive drinking, and he ultimately decides to join his wife in death.\n\nThe similarity between the King of Thule and the character in \"Dream-Land\" is striking, with both figures being haunted by loss and finding solace in drink. Interestingly, Goethe's \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe's use of the term Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" \n\nPoe references Thule twice in his collected works, using the phrase \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and employing it as a bookend in \"Dream-Land.\" When read alongside Goethe's \"The King of Thule,\" the two poems can be seen as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a desolate landscape of Thule, marked by darkness, loneliness, and a world devoid of color. This echoes the King of Thule's story, who has lost his will to live after the passing of his wife.\n\nGiven Poe's admiration for Tennyson, it's likely that he would have been familiar with Goethe's work. Poe's statement on Tennyson aside, it's clear that he would have been exposed to Goethe's writing through various reproductions and adaptations that followed the original publication.",
            "Here's the juicy stuff that could help a customer injured from slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store get a hefty chunk of change from the store manager.  I'm talking punitive damages, baby - the kind that can make someone's wallet weep. So, under California law, is this possible? Can Jennifer Palmer, the injured party, show that the store manager, Paul Martin, acted with malice when he ignored the spill for a whole half-hour because he was too busy eating dinner? \n\nRest assured, a judge won't dismiss her claim without a fight. To win punitive damages, Palmer needs to show that Martin recklessly disregarded the harm that could come from not cleaning up the spill. She can argue that the manager should have known better since multiple customers had slipped on the same spot in the months leading up to her accident. And let's not forget, he still didn't do squat to fix it despite all those prior incidents.\n\nNow, some might say Palmer's argument about Martin's actions being despicable is a bit of a stretch, but it's not entirely unreasonable given the facts. Six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009 and no action taken to prevent them? That's just not cool.\n\nLet's take a trip down memory lane. On October 13th, 2009, around 5 pm, an employee, Rich Wayne, told Martin about the applesauce spill, but he blew him off, saying he was on dinner break. Another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also warned Martin about the spill 15 minutes later, but he gave her the same brush-off. Guess who slipped and fell on the spill at 5:30 pm? That's right, Jennifer Palmer, and she ended up with a serious back injury. It's no wonder she's suing D&D Markets for compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nIn California, if a defendant acts with \"oppression, fraud or malice,\" a plaintiff can win punitive damages for a breach of obligation not arising from a contract. The law defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm or, if no intent, the defendant's actions were so bad that they demonstrate a \"willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" So, was Martin's inaction a malicious act? Did he know the probable harm that could come from not cleaning up the spill, and did he deliberately ignore it? According to the courts, a defendant's actions are malicious if they knew the likely consequences of their actions and chose to ignore them.\n\nIn this case, the courts might just decide that Martin's actions were indeed malicious, and Palmer could be on her way to a fat check. But we're not there yet. It's time to see if we should file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim. Stay tuned!",
            "It's been almost four years since I took a course in Islam at CBC, and the topic of whether Islam is a hostile religion remains a pressing issue.  I firmly believe that this question is more relevant now than ever, especially considering the media's shift in perspective since 9/11.  I recall the way the media used to portray Islam and extremists as hostile entities, only to swing to the opposite end of the spectrum and become excessively tolerant of Islam in America.  It's hard to imagine that in 2001, a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, with an openly Muslim background, could have even been considered viable.\n\nThe Biography of the Prophet Muhammad has left me with a compelling narrative that contradicts the man I thought I knew from history.  According to my understanding, Muhammad was supposed to be a figure who forced people to convert to Islam after conquering tribes and imposing his rule.  However, the biography paints a completely different picture – that of a humble, misunderstood, and humbled individual who was shunned by others but ultimately drew followers who saw the truth in his teachings.  This portrayal has left me questioning the validity of the history I thought I knew.\n\nThe parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the supposed miracles of Muhammad are remarkable.  One of the most striking examples is the story of feeding forty men with a small amount of mutton and milk, which seems eerily similar to Jesus' miracle of feeding the multitudes.  It's this type of writing that makes me suspect the authors were trying to portray Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove anything, but lived a life of truth and miracles.  This approach undermines the significance of Jesus' life and ministry, making it seem like a pale imitation.\n\nI also find it interesting that the biography features many stories that aim to provide proof of 'witness' or show how people converted to Islam of their own accord.  However, these stories often rely on third-party accounts, which diminish their credibility in my eyes.  While the authors intended to provide evidence of the truth, it only makes the stories seem more suspect and less authentic.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this work is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly figure, portraying him as humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  History, however, contradicts this image, and I can't help but wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true story behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "As Christianity progressed beyond its roots, the teachings of Jesus and the core beliefs he held during his lifetime were cast aside in favor of a more developed theory. When viewed from a broad perspective, a pattern emerges of Christianity gradually straying further and further from its authentic origin. Today, an increasing awareness and a shift towards progression are underway, revealing a growing desire for a return to the true essence of the faith. While traditionalists may cling to established doctrine, they may not be numerous enough to influence the broader masses. As time passes, however, a historical awareness will grow among Christians, driving a yearning to distinguish between the original intent of Christianity and the doctrines that were added over time. This reversal of trends will eventually lead to a movement that sheds its accumulated layers, gradually stripping away the extraneous to reveal the pure essence of Jesus' original message. A gradual clock-like motion will be seen as people return to the core principles Jesus instilled, untainted by the additions of subsequent thinkers.  As this forward-thinking movement sweeps through the United States and Europe, expect to see a shift from the current divergence towards a more uniform and cohesive understanding of the faith. The church, as an institution, will remain a guiding force, but the turbulent diversity of Christendom will give way to increased uniformity across regions, denominations, and divisions. History is replete with examples of such reversals – consider how Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire, only to see the empire eventually adopt Christianity. Similarly, the United States transitioned from slavery to African-American leadership. In the future, Christianity will undergo a profound reversal, undoing the accumulated history in the quest for its authentic roots, and in the process, shedding its diversity. A crucial aspect of this shift will be reinterpreting Jesus' words as metaphorical rather than literal statements. Looking back, we find the seeds of Christianity in Judaism, which flourished as a divinely revealed, monotheistic faith before the Roman Empire's control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population was not a homogeneous entity; it was fragmented into various groups, including the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common folk.",
            "As I reflect on the timeless classic, The Jungle, I'm struck by the harsh reality that deep down, humans are often driven by self-interest and a desire for personal gain, leaving those in lower positions to fend for themselves. This is starkly illustrated in the novel, particularly through the lens of the factory owners and managers. Their only concern is to expand and thrive, no matter the cost to others or the environment. They're depicted as callous and ruthless, with no regard for the devastating impact of their actions, as Upton Sinclair masterfully conveys through the vivid image of the factories' towering chimneys belching smoke into the air, symbolizing the destruction they cause. The owners and managers show no empathy for the harm their endeavors inflict on the people and animals living in the shadows of Packingtown, nor do they care about the well-being of their employees, whom they treat as nothing more than means to an end. They're driven by a relentless pursuit of profit, as Sinclair so poignantly puts it: \"So from top to bottom, this place is a seething cauldron of jealousy and hatred, devoid of loyalty and decency, where a man is nothing more than a commodity to be exploited for a dollar.\" During the era in which the book is set, workers were at the mercy of their employers, forced to toil in inhumane conditions with little to no protection or support. The system was designed to prioritize profit over people, leaving workers to suffer and struggle in a desperate fight for survival. The novel suggests that the workers were, in effect, treated as slaves, their lives hanging in the balance of their employers' whims, with no escape from the crushing system of Packingtown.",
            "Many authors employ various tactics to evoke a particular sentiment or attitude in their readers. The effectiveness of these techniques can vary, but F. Scott Fitzgerald masterfully weaves them throughout his novel, The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs seemingly mismatched adjectives and nouns to conjure a specific atmosphere around a subject. He also assigns meaning to symbols and later utilizes them to convey a particular mood. This technique is particularly evident in his use of colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink.\n\nIn The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald meticulously builds up associations for white/gray, then skillfully employs them to elicit a certain response from his readers. The significance he attributes to white/gray is uniformity, with white generally representing a more refined and upper-class connotation, while gray carries a sense of age and faded elegance. Fitzgerald sets the stage for these meanings early in the novel through repeated references to both colors. We see this in the way Daisy and Jordan are constantly \"in white\" (8) – everyone, it seems, is donning white attire: Nick sports \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby's party, Tom wears a \"white shirt\" (36) when meeting Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only time white attire is absent is during Nick's initial impressions of Gatsby's party, where the halls are \"gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further defines these colors by associating them with everyday, mundane subjects: as Nick heads to work, he navigates \"the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the names of people at Gatsby's parties become \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's timetable, and Catherine's apartment is likened to \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\" – epitomizing uniformity.\n\nFitzgerald then uses these established meanings to convey a sense of unimportance or uniformity in certain subjects. This process begins with Daisy. After a prolonged period without significant use of white/gray, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster\"; readers start to perceive Daisy as less of a distinct character and more of a uniform entity, a mere aspiration for Gatsby (74). Fitzgerald employs this technique repeatedly to reinforce this impression of Daisy as a uniform addition, as seen in the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18) and her appearance in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "The San Diego County is a veritable garden of plenty, thanks to its sun-kissed climate that makes it an ideal place for agriculture. The region is blessed with a diverse array of crops, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There's a thriving market for organic community supported agriculture food in the area, with many local organizations boasting lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand, and some farms even offer tours of their operations, along with opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This type of farming operation allows landowners to tap into government programs while preserving the land's natural beauty, creating a win-win situation for both the environment and their bank accounts.\n\nHowever, organic farming isn't without its challenges. It requires more labor and management to maintain soil health without relying on chemicals, which can lead to greater costs and losses compared to conventional farming methods. Small organic farms often lack the efficiency of large-scale operations, making it harder to compete in the market. Other practices that benefit wildlife, such as planting cover crops and removing invasive species, also incur additional labor costs. As a result, landowners in this scenario might seek financial assistance or expert guidance to maximize their profits while preserving the land's biodiversity.\n\nThe chosen property is a 160-acre plot adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. The land is a mix of chaparral, non-native grassland, and oak woodland, nestled next to the Cleveland National Forest within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. This plan, still under review, aims to protect over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered or declining, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and several butterfly species. The area has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This particular piece of land was likely used for grazing and wood production for many years, given its original homestead patent status.\n\nTo explore the options available to a small farmer in this area, I chose a property from a real estate website and researched government programs that could help mitigate costs and support wildlife-friendly farming practices. As a model for what someone farming this land might aim to achieve, I looked at an existing organic farm in the same region.",
            "The intricacies of culture play a pivotal role in any negotiation, but they're often misunderstood or oversimplified. Culture is a complex web of nuances that can be just as easily defined by what it's not as by what it is. It's not a monolith, nor is it uniform or one-dimensional. Statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are woefully broad and reductive. A more productive approach for a negotiator is to grasp the significance of a culture in relation to the specific issue at hand and how its attitude will impact the negotiations. When engaging with a foreign culture, we inevitably view it through the lens of our own, and comparisons inevitably arise. \n\nDelving into a foreign culture often requires a multidisciplinary approach, encompassing everything from historical context to understanding its biases. Rather than judging or trying to change a culture, it's essential to accept it for what it is and navigate its boundaries, particularly in high-stakes negotiations where a weaker bargaining position is at play. When operating in unfamiliar territory, a deep respect for local traditions and customs can be a game-changer in breaking down cultural barriers and moving the negotiation forward.\n\nIt's a common misconception that culture is solely bound by national or international borders. In reality, many companies within a given nation have their own distinct corporate cultures that can be just as influential as any national culture. This can manifest in everything from dress codes and communication styles to hiring practices and employee values. Even within the United States, corporate cultures vary wildly from company to company, and within companies, there are often regional and urban-suburban differences that showcase the diversity of thought within a particular societal culture. Don't be fooled by a uniform exterior – it's often a sign to dig deeper.\n\nValues are the key to understanding the underlying dynamics of a culture. If a culture places a high value on saving face or communal harmony, a negotiator will likely avoid publicly embarrassing their company or superior in pursuit of a deal. Conversely, a culture that prioritizes driving a hard bargain won't necessarily be willing to settle at the earliest opportunity. By considering these cultural nuances before the negotiating table, you'll be better equipped to navigate the complexities of cross-cultural negotiation. But it's equally important to learn about your opponent on a personal level to make the negotiation a success.",
            "We often hear the phrase, \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God,'\" which originates in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and is famously referenced by St. Anselm in his argument for the existence of God. Interestingly, Thomas Aquinas seems to share this sentiment, and as we delve into their arguments, it's worth assuming they're both correct in their belief, specifically in the God of the Bible. If we were to consider a different concept of God, it would skew our comparison, as their arguments are centered around a particular idea of the divine. Therefore, let's begin by accepting their shared premise for the sake of clarity.\n\nWhile both authors bring up valid points, neither provides a comprehensive foundation for faith in God. To illustrate this, let's break down St. Anselm's basic argument. He suggests that understanding and proof of God can be found within ourselves, through introspection and faith. According to Anselm, because our minds inherently grasp the concept of God, we can't effectively conceive of his nonexistence. On the surface, this idea might be wordy and unclear, but in essence, Anselm is saying that the truth about God is within our own minds and doesn't require external evidence. This concept of accepting the truth without empirical proof is often referred to as faith in Christian texts.\n\nIn stark contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas proposes that God's existence can be proven solely through reason and empirical evidence, eliminating the need for faith altogether. This idea would be beneficial in evangelism, as it would allow for the recruitment of new converts based on logic rather than blind faith. Aquinas presents five logical arguments supporting God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for his existence. Think of it like this: if you're told you're missing a puzzle piece and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can infer the features and existence of the missing piece without seeing it.",
            "Twenty-five hundred years ago, a prince destined to become the revered figure known as Buddha was born. Throughout the course of his life, he renounced worldly pursuits and achieved enlightenment, paving the way for the emergence of Buddhism. This ancient faith has undergone significant transformations since its inception, a phenomenon evident in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is an integral part of the culture. Despite the fact that Buddha never preached about such festivities, this event brings together monks and laypeople alike, reflecting the dynamic evolution of the religion. From superficial customs to its fundamental tenets, the Theravada Buddhist community has had to adapt its principles over time. This metamorphosis can be attributed to factors both within and outside the Buddhist fold, encompassing a range of influences, from the benign to the hostile.\n\nTo facilitate this discussion, it's essential to understand the key terms that will be used throughout. Internally, an internal force refers to any influence originating from within the Buddhist community, regardless of one's monastic status. Conversely, an external force is any influence stemming from non-Buddhists. As for hostile and benign forces, a hostile force is any influence that seeks to harm or damage the Buddhist community, often driven by a negative perception of the faith. A benign force, on the other hand, is an influence that neither wishes to harm nor help the community, though it might inadvertently do so.\n\nNow, let's delve into the core of Theravada Buddhism, exploring the fundamental doctrines that form its foundation. At the heart of the faith lies the concept of the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma encompasses the Tripitaka, a collection of sacred texts divided into three baskets: the Sutta Pitaka (containing the Suttas), the Vinaya Pitaka (outlining disciplinary rules), and the Abhidhamma Pitaka (dealing with metaphysical concepts). Central to these metaphysical notions are the principles of Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering in life), and Anicca (the impermanence of everything). Recognizing these concepts holds the key to breaking free from Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, and ultimately transcending lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). In the Vinaya Pitaka, guidelines for daily life are established, with five precepts for laypeople (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not engage in misconduct, and I shall not consume intoxicating substances) and additional disciplinary rules for monks. At the heart of Buddhism lies the four noble truths, a fundamental doctrine that encompasses the reality of suffering (Dukkha), the causes of suffering (attachment), and the possibility of overcoming suffering.",
            "For over five decades, the United States and Mexico were locked in a bitter rivalry that would leave a lasting impact on their relationship. From 1836 to 1893, tensions simmered between the two nations, with the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848 being the turning point. This conflict saw the United States emerge victorious, claiming Texas and the American Southwest as its own. However, clashes between the two nations continued to erupt over the years, finally dying down just before the outbreak of World War I.\n\nAt its core, the rivalry between the United States and Mexico was fueled by deep-seated differences over issues like religion, culture, and tradition. Material interests also played a significant role in exacerbating the tensions between the two nations. It's a pattern we see repeated in many other rivalries between nations that share a border, where clashing interests inevitably lead to the development of opposing positions.\n\nDavid M. Pletcher noted that the United States had long-standing diplomatic issues with two countries in particular: Mexico and Cuba. Given their geographical proximity to the United States, it's no surprise that these nations have historically found themselves at odds with America. In contrast, many other Latin American countries have enjoyed more harmonious relations with the United States.\n\nThe religious divide between the United States and Mexico was a significant factor in their rivalry. Sally Frahm pointed out that Americans were long opposed to Catholicism and monarchy, which created a deep-seated distrust between the two nations. This ideological struggle was reminiscent of the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, but in this case, the stakes were tied to religious differences rather than politics. The lingering effects of English-Spanish animosity only served to further complicate the relationship between the two nations.\n\nAccording to Diehl and Goerts, there were 17 notable disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry period. Many of these disputes centered on territorial issues, including border raids and frontier problems. Bandits and outlaws from both sides of the border posed a major challenge that wasn't fully addressed until both countries deployed military force to secure their borders.\n\nAs Schmitt noted, the rivalry between the United States and Mexico finally began to dissipate as Mexico became increasingly dependent on its northern neighbor. The shift in American ambitions from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico marked the beginning of a new era in their relationship, one that would eventually lead to a more peaceful and cooperative relationship between the two nations.",
            "Fifteen years ago, my life took an unexpected detour when a mysterious illness struck, leaving me disabled and out of the workforce. I was a nurse, a career I had chosen for its stability after hearing the constant mantra in my youth: \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\" My true passions lay in science and journalism, but I opted for nursing to ensure a secure future. \n\nNow, at 46, I'm single, with nothing to show for it, relying on Social Security Disability for survival. It's a daily struggle, a relentless assault on my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Yet, amidst this chaos, I've come to realize that the one constant in my life is the unwavering support of my family and a handful of true friends. When disaster hits, you're not as invincible as you think. \n\nMy point is that life is full of unexpected challenges, big and small. No matter how well-prepared you are, some storms are too intense to weather alone. \n\nWhile it's essential to take responsibility for our own lives, I strongly believe we need to shift our focus from solely relying on the government to learning to trust and support one another. Rather than building individual shelters, we should strive to build a community where neighbors look out for each other. \n\nThe concept of rugged individualism, often touted by Conservatives, is a myth. It was compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources that saw our ancestors through the tough times, not self-reliance. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it alone; they worked together.\n\nBy all means, be prepared. I've invested in a disaster kit, first-aid supplies, and other essentials. If you have the means, consider starting a small farm or investing in a wood stove. However, don't overlook the most vital survival tool of all – building strong relationships with those around you. Get to know your neighbors, and together, you'll be better equipped to face life's uncertainties.",
            "We often ponder the enigma of why organisms evolve in the manner that they do. Are there unseen forces at play that shape the course of evolutionary change? While D'Arcy Thompson astutely observed in 1917 that the task of defining organic forms in mathematical terms was still a distant dream, we're still far from grasping this complexity today. However, recent advances in mathematical modeling have begun to shed light on the intricacies of mollusk development, particularly in the realm of skeletogenesis (Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research seeks to leverage mathematical modeling, in tandem with experimental studies, to unravel the underlying mechanisms driving the direction and magnitude of evolutionary change in Prunum.\n\nTo achieve this, we're examining how X-radiographic images of Prunum species can be used to quantify parameters that can then be input into software programs like CerioShell (Stone, 1995) to model hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. These models enable us to explore the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum, providing a framework for understanding macroevolutionary events within this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a spiral tube that traverses 360 degrees of space over time. This spiral path is composed of whorls, which are formed by the animal's growth and are considered to be centered around an imaginary axis, known as the columella. The speed at which each whorl enlarges can vary, and a continuous line separating each whorl is referred to as a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the body whorl, while the spire consists of all the whorls except the last. The apex, or tip, of the spire marks the beginning, while the base represents the opposite end. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from different perspectives, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. Typically, shells are depicted in apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.\n\nTo count whorls accurately, one must first view the shell from the apical perspective and identify the starting point of the first suture. A line can then be drawn, dividing the shell into two parts, and whorls can be counted from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures that unfold through time and space as the animal adds to its shell. By tracing the path of the aperture using the center coordinates of each whorl's aperture and its horizontal and vertical radius, we can create a mathematical representation of this trajectory. This mathematical formulation enables us to manipulate parameters and modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "I've been pondering the stark reality of neonatal and infant mortality rates in Indonesia, which have remained stubbornly stagnant for a decade. As the country makes strides in meeting Millennium Development Goals such as water and sanitation targets, its progress in child and maternal health lags woefully behind. The reasons for this disappointing trend are multifaceted and point to a pressing need to fortify the overall health system rather than relying on piecemeal interventions.\n\nIndonesia has made some progress in increasing the number of births attended by skilled health workers, with a commendable 72% now meeting this benchmark. However, this statistic is somewhat misleading, as it still includes traditional workers like midwives who are unable to provide medical interventions in complicated cases, leading to a disproportionate number of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage. Furthermore, there's been a concerning decline in the percentage of children under five receiving treatment for diarrheal cases from a health professional, and data on postnatal care is woefully inadequate.\n\nAnother worrisome trend is the relatively low cesarian-section rate of around 4%, which is compounded by the stark disparities between urban and rural areas – 7% in cities versus a paltry 2% in rural regions. This stark contrast highlights the issue of unequal access to healthcare services, with urban areas receiving preferential treatment. Vertical equity is another concern, with a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, suggesting that the poor are facing significant barriers in accessing healthcare due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nAs we consider the next steps to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the fundamental question is how to address the chronic shortage of services. Should Indonesia focus on developing targeted programmatic approaches or strengthen its overall health system without pandering to the specific needs of pre and post-pregnancy care for mothers and their children? While programmatic approaches may seem attractive, they have their drawbacks. For instance, investing heavily in one area can divert resources away from other critical areas, leading to a brain drain of human resources and duplication of services. This not only wastes resources but also creates an administrative nightmare with excessive forms and paperwork.",
            "Victorian novels are infamous for their meticulous attention to detail and their focus on the lives of the aristocracy of the time.  However, two novels that break away from this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both works incorporate an air of mystery and an affinity for the bizarre, traits that were uncommon in novels of the period, but which serve to strengthen the characters within each story, offering a deeper look into their motivations and emotions.\n\nAs Oliver Twist navigated the treacherous world of Victorian London, a maelstrom of bewildering ideas swirled inside his mind. The echoes of his encounters with Sikes and Crackit lingered, their voices arguing in his ears, while his own thoughts struggled to regain focus. The sound of gunfire shattered the silence, and Oliver was swept up in a whirlwind of confusion as unseen forces bore him away. Amidst the chaos, a gnawing sense of pain and discomfort gnawed at him, refusing to let him escape.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, these unsettling occurrences often manifest as dream sequences or dreamlike states, revealing hidden facets of Oliver's psyche and the turmoil that wracked his inner world. When Oliver relives the moment of his near-fatal shooting in chapter 28, the scene unfolds with a dreamlike quality, as if he's reliving the trauma all over again while desperately seeking help. This passage highlights Oliver's powerlessness in the face of the events that have unfolded, and the dire state of his health, which is reflected in his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, numbing all his senses as an unseen force bears him away, leaving him to relive his despair in a state of constant fear rather than shock. This event raises questions about whose actions led to his misfortune, as it's clear that Oliver's fate was not of his own making. The scene also implies a growing sense of defeat in Oliver, as if Fagin's influence has broken him, forcing him to accept his despair and rendering him unable to react.\n\nThe passage from Wuthering Heights reads like a haunting refrain: \"The day passed – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\" This sense of time's fluidity, where day and night blur into one another, creates a sense of disorientation, underscoring the turmoil that pervades the story. The passage speaks to the novel's use of time as a fluid, malleable concept, where the boundaries between reality and fantasy blur, and the characters are left to navigate the uncertainties of their own lives.",
            "I still remember my time working in an after-school program, where I was tasked with tutoring elementary students in a variety of subjects, but my true passion lay in helping them with reading and English. One student in particular, a young boy named Adrian, really stood out to me. He was around third or fourth grade, and I was assigned to work with him because he was struggling to read. What struck me as peculiar was that some letters he could pronounce flawlessly, while others left him completely stumped – it was as if he was speaking a different language. Given that he was Latino, I assumed that might be the issue, but his English was spotless. I spent many sessions with him, trying to figure out the problem, until the day his mother walked into the room. Her only language was Spanish, and I attempted to communicate with her using my limited Spanish skills. It was a defining moment – I realized that Adrian's struggles weren't about reading, but rather, he didn't know the English alphabet. I hope he's found success since then.\n\nSharing this story highlights the complex issue of the language barrier in schools, especially here in California. It's a problem that's often overlooked, but it's not always as straightforward as we think. Even a child who speaks perfect English can struggle with reading, as I learned with Adrian. We all agree that this issue exists, so what's the solution? In Adrian's case, it was as simple as extra English reading tutoring, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for students who barely speak English, it's a much more complex problem.\n\nThere's no single answer, but rather a combination of approaches that work together. The dual language system is a great concept, not just for kids who speak Spanish as their first language, but for all children. Research shows that students in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Many people fear that this system is a waste of resources, but it's not true. If we implemented this approach as a standard, all children would benefit from it. So, how do we make this happen? Do we require teachers to be bilingual? That's unrealistic, but we can hire bilingual aids, tutors, or whatever we want to call them, to support our students.",
            "From the time we're young, many of us are taught that there's something greater than ourselves, something that transcends our understanding. Some of us are sent to Sunday school, while others seek answers within themselves or explore the spiritual paths our parents have laid out for us. Some accept these teachings without question, while others reject them entirely, choosing to forge their own paths. We might adopt one set of values, only to later discard them for another. Ultimately, our search for meaning leads us down a winding road to discover a part of ourselves through our unique perspectives on spirituality, seeking a guiding light to lead us out of the darkness and into the light.\n\n[The memory of that rainy evening still lingers.] My dad and I sat on our front porch, listening to the rain drum against the tin roof above. We both smoked cigarettes, lost in our own thoughts. The rainwater pouring from the gutters drowned the plants at the edge of the porch, and my dad's eyes gazed out into the downpour, a mix of introspection and distant recollection. His frame seemed smaller, his clothes hanging loosely, and his hair was thinner than I remembered. That's when I realized he was struggling – and I was struggling too. I couldn't bring myself to talk about how much I'd miss him, as acknowledging it would make it all too real. Instead, I hugged him, sat down beside him, and joined him in gazing out into the rain.\n\nMy dad passed away that December, just five days before my twenty-second birthday. The treatments had prolonged his suffering, but at what cost? I couldn't fathom it. As I lay alone in the dark, I didn't pray. If a higher power existed, I thought, it had long since stopped listening to me. \n\nI refused to watch him slip away. I chose to remember my dad through his life, not his final moments. I knew him better than anyone, and I was certain he wouldn't have wanted me to be there for his passing. I curled up in my bed for three days, waiting for the news. And yet, no one even called.",
            "The Gothic Novel: A Timeless Contradiction \nI still chuckle when I think about Ian Watt's clever description of the Gothic Novel as an 'oxymoron for Old-New.' It was as if he was trying to capture the essence of this peculiar literary beast that has been both revered and ridiculed throughout history. Critics have attacked the Gothic genre for lacking depth, yet praised it for its ability to evoke the 'terrible sublime.' (Burke) The genre has been around since the 18th century, when Horace Walpole first penned The Castle of Otranto, a true pioneer in the proto-Gothic genre. By combining the 'old' theatrical elements of medieval romances with the 'new' novelistic format, Walpole created something entirely new - a Gothic Story. \n\nAs I delve into the world of Gothic literature, I notice how it often relies on throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. It was a time when the word 'gothic' was used to describe everything from people to styles to time periods, often with a hint of nostalgia and a dash of disdain for the 'modern' world. It's fascinating to see how Walpole merged the grandeur of the Gothic with the intimacy of the novel, creating a reading experience that feels both ancient and modern. \n\nOne of the key aspects of Gothic literature that has captured my attention is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of training a proper knight is woven throughout the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is particularly significant in Gothic writing because it represents a bygone era of bravery, honor, and competence - an era that many writers, like Walpole, felt was sadly lacking in their own time. By romanticizing the 'gothic past,' writers like Walpole aimed to critique their own society and, perhaps, even hint at the future evolution of Gothic to Romanticism. \n\nAs I read through The Castle of Otranto, I'm struck by the character of Frederic, a prince who embodies many chivalric traits. His description is a masterclass in Gothic tropes: a prince, a victim of tragedy, and a man shrouded in mystery. The image of the 'gallant and courteous Knight' is exaggerated, of course, but it's a perfect example of how excess was used to create a sense of drama and tension in the Gothic genre. As I ponder the complexities of Gothic literature, I'm reminded that even in its contradictions, there's a timeless beauty to be found.",
            "I've witnessed the evolution of supply chain management, a world of intricate processes that weaves together raw materials, production, and distribution to meet the ever-changing demands of customers. The term supply chain management was coined by Keith Oliver in 1982, a consultant with an eye for efficiency. Oliver described the delicate dance of planning, implementing, and controlling the supply chain to deliver customer satisfaction in a swift and seamless manner. \n\nAt the heart of supply chain management lies six essential elements: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These building blocks enable business managers to craft an experience that leaves customers wanting more. \n\nProduction is the foundation upon which the entire supply chain stands. It's the stage where the 'when,' 'why,' 'where,' and 'how' of product creation are carefully laid out. Managers must tune in to the market to grasp what customers crave. The market is the barometer that indicates the customer's desires, and by analyzing it, managers can decide what products to produce, how many to produce, and where to produce them. The goal is to meet customer demands while ensuring the best quality and volume.\n\nOnce production is underway, managers focus on scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. Every detail is crucial in this process, and mishaps can cost the company dearly in the long run. I've seen firsthand how having a clear process in place can make all the difference at companies like Wal-Mart and Target, where every aspect of the business, from employee attire to shipment reception, is meticulously planned.\n\nSupply is the second vital element in the supply chain equation. It involves strategic decisions about a company's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. Managers must decide which divisions of production are best suited for specific products, taking into account the equipment, personnel, and specialties required. Outsourcing work to other companies can be a smart move, as it enables the creation of velocity – the ability to deliver quality, flexibility, and low costs.",
            "A haunting message lurks on a street corner, Ellen Page's cardboard sign held high, the Sharpie-written words 'Hitler is alive in Burma' a stark reality check. Burma, now Myanmar, has been under the iron grip of a ruthless military junta since 1962, when the country was seized through a brutal coup d'état. The echoes of 2007 still linger, when a wave of protests swept the nation, known as the Saffron Revolution, in honor of the saffron-colored robes worn by the courageous Burmese monks who led the charge. What began as peaceful gatherings soon turned into a bloody conflict, with the military junta unleashing its wrath on monasteries and foreign journalists, including Japanese photojournalist Kenji Nagai, who fell to their brutality on September 27th, 2007. The official death toll may be 13, but defector Colonel Hla Win revealed a chilling truth: the real number of victims could be in the thousands.\n\nThis isn't a relic of the past. The world has been witnessing this tragic tale for millennia, as governments pursue power and silence dissent with ruthless abandon. From ancient Roman emperors claiming divine right to rule, to Japanese emperors deified as gods, to our own modern-day leaders who seem to answer to none, this dark chapter has been etched in human history. We see echoes of Tiananmen Square in 1989, where students, intellectuals, and labor activists dared to challenge the authorities, and the death toll may never be known for certain – 200 to 3,000, depending on who you believe. The Rwandan genocide, Hitler's Third Reich, and countless other atrocities serve as grim reminders of the horrors that unfold when governments turn against their own people.",
            "The unyielding legacy of Duke Ellington in the realm of jazz can be attributed in large part to his remarkable longevity and the boundless creative influence he exerted through his orchestra. Although his piano presence is understated in many of the compositions selected for this particular task, as a composer Ellington masterfully crafted complex, rich pieces that showcased the unique talents of individual band members. He skillfully wove the framework, allowing soloists to improvise freely, while also penning tightly orchestrated phrases that highlighted the distinct styles of his musicians. In doing so, Ellington successfully emphasized the ensemble's overall tone, creating original and coherent sounds to match each piece. Through his profound understanding of the individual players' sounds and how they blended together to form a cohesive unit, Ellington was able to produce some of the most groundbreaking and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\n\nA notable example of Ellington's innovative approach to sound is evident in his use of voice as an instrument, as illustrated in his early piece, Creole Love Call. This twelve bar blues, characterized by its slow and deliberate pace, features six distinct choruses, each showcasing Ellington's ability to complement the style of his soloists. The piece commences with a call and response between voice and reeds, with the voice beginning smoothly and melodically before transitioning to a rougher tone towards the end. This is followed by a muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes. Subsequent choruses feature a sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase, and a full band echo of the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections. The climactic fifth chorus sees the reeds initiating the call and response in a high register, supported by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections. The sixth and final chorus returns to the structure of the first, with call and response between voice and reeds, and in this instance, the voice takes on the sound of the \"growl\" technique, soloing as an instrument. A brief tag concludes the piece with a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is a hallmark of his work, as evident in subsequent compositions such as Hot and Bothered and It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing). In Hot and Bothered, Ellington seamlessly combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color, using a call and response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing to create a rich and complementary sound. Similarly, in It Don't Mean a Thing, Ellington employs Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to great effect, introducing the melody on muted trombone in a way that showcases the unique qualities of Nanton's playing.",
            "I'd been grappling with this unshakeable feeling of incompleteness since I was 14, when the world opened up and I found myself in the midst of teenage chaos. Three years later, at 17, I was still searching for something, though I'd narrowed it down to a desire for connection with someone rather than a mere object. Yet, I remained unimpressed by every boy who crossed my path, as if I was immune to the usual high school allure. I couldn't help but wonder what was behind this peculiarity, and I spent years mulling over various theories. But nothing ever added up, leaving me stuck in this cycle of self-doubt and curiosity.\n\nMy home life was a tranquil oasis amidst the turmoil. My parents were the epitome of calm and composure, rarely arguing with each other or with me – the only exceptions being when I pushed the boundaries of my independence and individuality. They were a peaceful couple, but I was the wild child in our household, bringing a spark of energy and playfulness that made me likable and admired by all who knew me.\n\nBut today was different. As I wandered through the house, searching for inspiration, the sound of my mother's distressed cry pierced the air, followed by the unmistakable tone of her voice. Panic set in as I sprinted towards the kitchen, my heart racing with every step. \"Mom! Mom, what's wrong?!\" I exclaimed, my voice trembling. I rushed into the room to find my mother lying on the ground, wincing in pain, her voice barely above a whisper. I dropped to her side, offering what little support I could. \"Ouch... sweetie, I... need you to take me to... the hospital.\" The words tumbled out in short, labored breaths, and I knew she was in agony. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up,\" I said, trying to keep my voice steady. My mother directed me with her hands, and I was grateful for every ounce of strength I'd built up through yoga and exercise, which now allowed me to lift her and carry her to the car.\n\nThe hospital was a flurry of sterile smells and worried faces, but my focus was solely on my mother's well-being. I quickly settled her into the backseat and drove, my mind racing with worry. At the hospital, I rushed to get her help, calling out to the doctors as they quickly gathered around. Soon, a rolling bed appeared, and my mother was whisked away for immediate attention. I was left to sit, my anxiety simmering just below the surface.\n\nAs it turned out, my mother had slipped off a step stool while trying to retrieve a vase from the highest cabinet. It was a simple misstep, but one that had sent her tumbling to the ground.",
            "It's a well-established fact that embracing the Mediterranean Diet, characterized by its emphasis on plant-based foods, monounsaturated fats, and moderate alcohol intake, can have a profound impact on our health. In fact, a plethora of studies have demonstrated that adhering to this diet can significantly reduce the risk of chronic heart disease and stroke. The study in question sheds light on the relationship between adherence to the \"Mediterranean Diet\" and the risk of heart-related issues, specifically chronic heart disease, stroke, and stroke mortality.\n\nIn essence, the Mediterranean Diet is a modified version of its precursor, with a greater focus on consuming plant-based proteins like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, while minimizing animal products and saturated fats. The results of prior studies have been promising, showcasing the diet's effectiveness in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. However, research has been lacking in the area of stroke and stroke mortality.\n\nOur investigation involved analyzing data from the Nurses' Health Study, which included 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, with no prior history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Over a period of 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, we computed an \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\" based on self-reported food frequency questionnaires. These questionnaires underwent validation studies to ensure accuracy. We also accounted for various lifestyle factors, including body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and leisure-time physical activity.\n\nTo minimize random variation and better represent long-term dietary habits, we calculated cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated questionnaires. We adjusted for potential confounders like age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use. Our analysis revealed that a higher aMed diet score was associated with a lower risk of heart disease and stroke in the study participants. Specifically, women with the highest aMed quintile had a 29% lower risk of chronic heart disease and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile.",
            "Fast forward to 2007, and it seemed like the world had hit rock bottom. The United States of America found itself in the midst of a devastating financial crisis. Joblessness skyrocketed, the housing market imploded, and many of America's largest corporations were left reeling. The question on everyone's lips was: how did this catastrophe unfold, and how can we prevent it from happening again? To put it bluntly, the financial crisis was the result of reckless and naive policy decisions that forced banks and firms to dispense sub-prime loans into a fragile financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were coerced into underwriting and repackaging these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were left scrambling for capital, and the chaos was transferred to the repackaged mortgages they'd sold, and ultimately, the entire economy.\n\nLooking back, the roots of the crisis stretch as far back as 1999, during the Clinton administration. The President was eager to secure a second term, and his team relaxed lending restrictions to boost his popularity. This move set the stage for the impending sub-prime crisis seven years later. In 1999, Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported on the pressure being felt by Fannie Mae, the nation's largest home mortgage underwriter, to offer loans to low- and moderate-income individuals. The government-subsidized corporation was also under pressure to maintain its rapid profit growth. Holmes astutely foresaw the consequences of these actions, warning of a potential government rescue similar to the savings and loan industry debacle of the 1980s. As we now know, ill-advised lending would ultimately lead to a catastrophic economic meltdown.\n\nA perfect storm of factors contributed to the economic freefall, including the complex and convoluted nature of modern mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were all extensively used in the years leading up to the crisis, intertwining various sectors of the economy with the housing market. U.S. households and financial markets as a whole became over-leveraged in the housing market, leaving them vulnerable to even the slightest price fluctuations.\n\nThe housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had invested in these mortgage-backed securities were left reeling. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, which accounted for approximately 30% of the country's GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at fire-sale prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to transition to commercial banks subject to intense regulatory oversight. Fannie and Freddie were in $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "I'll never forget that notorious section of my story where I'm tempted to unleash a torrent of exposition, stretching my writer's wings to impress, but often ending up putting my readers to sleep or sending them fleeing in frustration.  Dr. Merlin has been known to slam her monitor in exasperation when she finds herself stuck in a sea of Too Much Information, and I'm talking the not-very-fun kind.\n\nExposition is the enemy of a good story.\n\nMy fellow writers already know the age-old adage, \"Show, don't tell,\" but I still find myself succumbing to lengthy passages where nothing happens or, worse, too much happens.  Exposition is that pesky inner voice urging me to tell the reader everything, from the history to the minutest details, to get to the good stuff (not to be confused with the inner voice whispering to reveal every character's backstory, no matter how insignificant).\n\nExposition is essentially regaling the audience with a straightforward account of what's happening, often in dry prose.  In film, this plays out when one character unloads a wealth of information on another, à la \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nLet's take an example.  When reading a story, I'm informed that the heroine met her beloved at a specific time and place, got married in a grand celebration, and witnessed her husband's tragic murder.  I wouldn't expect this entire sequence to take up two pages, with both characters only getting a few lines of dialogue.  I'd expect the author to spend some time developing the husband's character, showing through his words and actions how deeply he adored his wife, and I'd expect the heroine to reveal, through her thoughts and actions, how his presence enriched her life.  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow me to become emotionally invested in his fate and gain insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, the depth of their bond, and clues about her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams reflected through his eyes.  I'd mourn his loss with her, growing more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, I'd expect more substance behind the bare bones of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, it's my job to provide that substance.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, and presses on*)  Sometimes it's tempting to rush past certain details.  Perhaps I'm introducing a new character with a storied past: he used to be in the Air Force, now runs the night shift at a gas station, has been married twice, has no kids, loves fishing on weekends, secretly dreams of owning the station someday, and starts his day with Eggs Benedict.",
            "I caught two local broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio, the first of which was NBC 4's live newscast on August 13, 2011. The leading story was about a heinous crime: a man named Shad Hostettler had stabbed his wife, though her name wasn't mentioned. They aired his mugshot, and he looked like the embodiment of pure evil. The news team devoted about two minutes to the story, which was still unfolding. I think they allocated an adequate amount of airtime to this distressing event. \n\nThe next story was about an early morning shooting involving 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically injured, and no arrests had been made or suspects identified at the time. The SWAT team was on the scene, investigating the crime. This story seemed rather rushed, and I suspect it might have been due to the fact that the victim was a black man from a predominantly black neighborhood. It's a phenomenon I've observed for years: when minorities are victims of a crime, they often get shortchanged in the news coverage. In contrast, if a white child or adult is kidnapped or a victim of a crime, the media goes into overdrive; but when it's a minority person, they're lucky if they get a mention.\n\nThe next story dealt with a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. The news team provided details about the possible location of the incident, and it was determined that a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle had hit the aircraft. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for any information leading to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nThe next story focused on the impending rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They mentioned that the temperatures would remain in the mid-to-low eighties for the weekend. The brief length of this story was likely due to the anchor wanting to use it as a teaser to keep viewers engaged.\n\nThey also covered a story about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The perpetrator was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt and estimated to be around six feet tall and 150 pounds. I found it peculiar that they devoted so much attention to his racial description and how dark he was.\n\nAnother story was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas-based marijuana kingpin who had conspired to distribute large quantities of the substance to Ohio. One thing that caught my attention was that instead of stating his 25-year prison sentence, they mentioned \"300 months.\" I'm not sure if they thought that made it sound harsher or if it was just a stylistic choice. They also highlighted that he was a Hispanic man, but I'm not convinced it was relevant to the story.",
            "There's a mystique surrounding brotherhood - an unbreakable bond that defies time and circumstance. Within its depths, a complex tapestry of emotions unfolds: love, pride, jealousy, cruelty, and more. Brothers have a unique understanding of one another, a connection that transcends the shallow relationships we form with others. When you look at your brother, you see a reflection of yourself, a truth that becomes glaringly evident in the most trying of times. This bond isn't always easy to navigate, and the emotions that accompany it come with a steep price. Understanding this fraternal link requires embracing the consequences that follow, and it's only when we can gaze into our brother's eyes that we truly see ourselves - not as others perceive us, but as we truly are. Our actions and their aftermath reveal our character, a truth that's difficult to confront but essential to growth.\n\nThe novel \"The Scarlet Ibis\" masterfully explores this theme, weaving a story of two brothers who navigate the intricate web of emotions tied to their bond. Against the backdrop of a lush, vivid landscape, these two boys embark on a futile journey, their relationship marked by bitter disappointment and intense pride. The climactic scene is a poignant example of this complex dynamic, and only one brother emerges unscathed. Through the protagonist's direct characterization and his interactions with his brother, as well as the narrator's nuanced perspective, we gain insight into the complex feelings that shape the protagonist's world and inform his actions.\n\nAt its core, the protagonist's actions are driven by one dominant emotion: pride. From their early adventures together to their final, fateful excursion, he grapples with resentment towards his little brother, Doodle. The protagonist had envisioned a brother who could share in his passions, a companion to explore the world with. He dreamed of racing to Horsehead Landing, perching in the top fork of the great pine, and learning the skills he'd mastered through trial and error. But Doodle's fragile health makes such exploits impossible, crushing the protagonist's fantasies and leaving him feeling bereft. The depth of his disappointment is evident in his disturbing thoughts of suffocating his brother, a bleak testament to the darkness that can lurk beneath the surface of even the most loving relationships. Yet, when Doodle smiles, the protagonist's heart softens, revealing a glimmer of hope and a love that's hard to deny. This dichotomy speaks to the complexity of brotherly love, a bond that's both beautiful and fraught with challenges.",
            "We're constantly amazed by the intricate complexity of the human brain, that unpredictable and creative information-processing machine. As technology has evolved from its humble beginnings to the modern era, so too have the metaphors used to describe our brains. We've seen it likened to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, a book, and most recently, a computer - each era's comparison shedding light on some aspect of its function. However, it's essential to remember that these analogies are helpful but limited, and can lead to misconceptions if taken too literally.\n\nWhen it comes to processing information, it all starts with the sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, or light into electrical signals. These signals are continually transformed by the brain's algorithms through both bottom-up and top-down processing. To illustrate this, imagine looking at a picture of a black box against a white background. Bottom-up processing involves breaking down the image into basic components like color and orientation, ultimately determining that you're seeing a box. Meanwhile, top-down processing uses the results of earlier steps to speed up your recognition of the object, helping you decide whether it's a box or a hole in the background.\n\nAs information is processed to a certain point, an attention filter kicks in, deciding which signals are most important and which cognitive processes they should be routed to. For example, you may process every blade of grass when you glance down at your shoes, but your attention filter helps you tune them out. Conversely, you might pick out your name in a noisy room. This process repeats at various stages, with the results of processing influenced by attention at each step.\n\nBefore the brain can process information, it must first store it. There are three primary types of memory: sensory, working, and long-term. Information is first encoded, and different types of encoding suit different sensory stimuli. When it comes to verbal input, for instance, it can be encoded based on its structural appearance, phonetic sound, or semantic meaning. Once stored, information must be maintained, and research suggests that working memory, which holds information for about 20 seconds, relies on an electrical signal looping through a specific series of neurons for a short time. Long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are numerous theories about how knowledge is organized within the brain, each with its unique perspective. Some are based on how humans retrieve memories, while others draw from computer science and neurophysiology. One such model is the semantic network, which proposes that concepts are represented by nodes and linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, the concept of \"chair\" might be connected to \"table,\" which in turn is linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley's dystopian novel, Brave New World, serves as a scathing critique of the impending dangers of unchecked technological advancement and the capitalist system that perpetuates it. The novel depicts a society where people value collectivity above individuality, with its citizens conditioned from a young age to prioritize immediate gratification above all else. The characters are unwitting pawns in a grand game, trapped within a narrow ideology dictated by the all-powerful World Controller. When viewed through the lens of Marxist ideology, Huxley's work reveals a deep-seated distrust of the emerging economic systems of his time.\n\nOne of the primary targets of Huxley's satire is the capitalist system, which is reflected in his use of Marxist concepts such as homogeny and reification. These terms highlight the ways in which capitalist systems can lead to the suppression of individuality and the uniformity of the masses. The novel's depiction of the lower classes, known as Deltas and Gammas, is particularly telling, as they are conditioned to prioritize consumption and indulgence above all else, thanks to the pervasive use of hypnopædia. This manipulation is masterminded by the World Controller, who maintains a stranglehold on the lower classes through ideological control.\n\nThe concept of hegemony – where a dominant group exercises control over a subordinate group – is also evident in Brave New World. The upper classes, comprising Alphas and Betas, are born with the knowledge of this manipulation but do little to challenge it, further solidifying the grip of capitalism on the society. The novel's portrayal of relationships between characters is also noteworthy, as they are superficial and lack depth. This may suggest that the rise of technology and capitalism has stripped individuals of their free will and emotional expression, reducing love and other intense emotions to mere surface-level interactions.\n\nThe novel's characters often focus on physical appearance, with men commenting on women's physical attributes and women discussing their romantic conquests with little shame. This limited emotional landscape serves as a commentary on the socioeconomic effects of capitalism, where individuals are content with their place in the hierarchy and conform to societal expectations. Their unwavering obedience to the status quo is a testament to Marxist theories on the proletariat, who are conditioned to believe in their own superiority as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform to the norms of their peers.",
            "It's been about two and a half years since I stepped onto the University Park campus, and four and a half semesters of navigating its twists and turns have taught me that getting around can be a real challenge. As a freshman, I was stuck in an East Halls dorm room, the farthest I could get from the action without venturing onto the stadium or Bryce Jordan Center grounds. Commuting from Stuart Hall to classes in buildings like Willard, smack in the center of campus, was a 25-minute trek – and that was on a good day, weather permitting. But I've learned that it wasn't always this way. I spoke with an alum not much older than myself, who shared that the East Halls used to be isolated from the rest of the campus by a massive expanse of unused land. Fast-forward to today, and that open space has been transformed into sports fields, sleek new buildings like the Creamery and health services center, and rows of apartments. As the campus continues to sprawl, getting from one place to another is becoming increasingly difficult.\n\nThat's when I realized the obvious solution – the humble bicycle. But it's not just about having a bike; students need to actually ride them, and the campus needs to be designed with cyclists in mind. I chatted with a friend who'd taken a several-year break from biking, only to rediscover its joys. \"Bikes are the way to go,\" he said. \"For a while, it wasn't cool to ride, but it's the only way to get around.\" Not only is biking great exercise, but it's also the most efficient way to travel. With a hearty bowl of oatmeal and a bit of effort, you can cover 30 miles or more. As an off-campus student, I now live just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. Buying a bike was one of the smartest decisions I made this year. Classes in Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from my place, are a breeze to get to on two wheels – just 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The problem is, Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas, isn't always a bike-friendly stretch. Walking, on the other hand, is a viable option, but with my schedule, I just don't have the time. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option, sucking up an extra 30-40 minutes of my day – over two and a half hours every week. That's time I just can't afford to spare."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

I'm drawn to the Division of Family and Children Services, where I can make a real difference in the lives of kids who've been dealt a tough hand. I'd like to support families in crisis and help them navigate the darkest of times. My values align with this field in a big way: service, respect, and a strong sense of ethics are non-negotiables for me. I'm also committed to helping others, whether it's building strong relationships within families or pushing myself to stay ahead of the curve in this ever-evolving field.\n\nLooking back, I've always wanted to use my skills to help others, but I wasn't sure where to start. Throughout high school and college, I saw people dodging their problems and coping in not-so-ideal ways. That's why I pursued a degree in Psychology, hoping it would be a step in the right direction. Even after graduation from Piedmont College in 2009, I remained unsure of my path. But everything changed on a summer day when a friend introduced me to a 16-year-old kid who was desperate to escape his abusive parents. I listened to his story and, the next day, I went to the police to share my concerns and offer my support. It was a turning point for me – I realized I wanted to dedicate my career to helping kids like him who are caught in the crossfire of family conflicts.\n\nSocial justice is another value that drives me. We claim to celebrate individuality, but in reality, we often try to fit in and follow the crowd. I'm not interested in being a follower; I want to be a trailblazer. Throughout my high school and college years, I protested against social injustices whenever I could – from expressing myself through bold fashion choices to speaking out against racism and discrimination. I believe in fighting for what's right and promoting equality for all.",
            "Insomnia: A Multifaceted Disorder at the Convergence of Biology and Culture\n\nThis paper delves into the complex world of insomnia, a sleep disorder that has been extensively studied through the lenses of both biological and sociocultural models. The biological model focuses on the genetic and physiological underpinnings of insomnia, while the sociocultural model examines the environmental and social factors that contribute to the disorder. This review aims to explore the relationship between these two models, highlighting the key research findings and their implications for understanding insomnia.\n\nInsomnia can manifest in various forms, including primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders linked to mental health issues, and sleep disorders caused by medical complications or substance intake. The primary sleep disorders include Dyssonmias, such as Primary Insomnia and Primary Hypersomnia, as well as Parasomnias, which involve behavioral abnormalities and physiological occurrences during sleep. In this review, we will focus primarily on insomnia and, to some extent, on the broader category of primary sleep disorders.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes the role of genetics, heritable factors, and physiological mechanisms in the development of insomnia. Research has shown that neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice found that the presence of phenotypic GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons is essential for sleep-wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while its inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and increased sleep. The GABAB agonist, baclofen, has been shown to increase sleep time in mice, suggesting a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. This finding implies that alterations in this receptor could impact an individual's ability to achieve adequate sleep without medication, with potential consequences for daily life, including academic, professional, and mundane tasks.\n\nThe sociocultural implications of this study are significant, as the inheritance of this phenotype could regulate sleep patterns and an alteration of the receptor could naturally disrupt sleep. This, in turn, could negatively impact various aspects of life, including school, career, and daily events that require sustained focus and attention. By examining the intersection of biology and culture, we gain a deeper understanding of the complex factors contributing to insomnia and its far-reaching consequences.",
            "The following is a comprehensive overview of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), a condition that has quietly wreaked havoc on the lives of many. To begin, let's define CAPD. Simply put, it's a disorder where the central nervous system, the command center of our being, has trouble processing auditory information. Don't get me wrong – people with CAPD can hear just fine; it's just that their brain has a hard time making sense of what they hear. Imagine trying to tune into your favorite radio station, only to have the static overwhelm the music – that's essentially what's happening in the brains of those with CAPD. \n\nThe history of CAPD dates back to the 1950s, when researchers first started studying children with communication disorders. The term \"auditory imperception\" was coined back then, and since then, we've made significant progress in understanding this complex condition. In the 1960s, scientists like Kimura made groundbreaking discoveries about the way our brains process sound, paving the way for the development of tests that could help diagnose CAPD.\n\nSo, what does CAPD look like in real life? It can manifest in a variety of ways, from difficulty localizing sounds to trouble distinguishing between different speech patterns. For example, someone with CAPD might struggle to pick up on sarcasm or have trouble following a conversation in a noisy environment. It's like trying to decipher a code that's constantly shifting. Other signs include trouble filtering out background noise or distinguishing between multiple sounds at the same time.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD is no simple task. It requires a comprehensive evaluation, often involving a team of experts, including audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists. They'll use a range of tests to assess auditory skills, including behavioral observations and questionnaires. There's no single \"magic test\" that can diagnose CAPD, and the exact cause remains a mystery. However, by understanding the complexities of CAPD, we can better support those affected and help them navigate a world that's often overwhelming.\n\nAs a teacher in a mainstream classroom, what can you do to help a student with CAPD thrive? It's all about creating a supportive environment that acknowledges their unique needs. By being aware of the challenges they face and making a few simple adjustments, you can help level the playing field. It's time to give CAPD the attention it deserves and help those affected live their best lives.",
            "Twelfth Night seems to suggest that donning a disguise can lead to deception, but ultimately, it's crucial to shed that false persona or risk losing one's true self. However, abandoning the charade can result in isolation, as it's a delicate balancing act between self-preservation and maintaining relationships with others. The reactions of those around you can be unpredictable, ranging from indifference to outrage, especially when it comes to deception in matters of gender identity. \n\nThis dilemma is particularly complex when it comes to gender role reversal, as it raises questions about the underlying motivations behind the disguise. In the case of Viola, her decision to pose as a man seems to be driven by a desire for self-protection. As she navigates this new environment, her disguise helps her avoid potential threats, but it also creates a disconnect from her support system and forces her to conceal her true feelings.\n\nViola's ruse is so convincing that Olivia becomes infatuated with her, further complicating matters. Viola's interactions with Orsino also raise questions about her own suppressed emotions, as she's forced to confront her feelings of unrequited love. Some may see this as a progressive exploration of repressed desires, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. The text hints that their emotions may be repressed, and the appearance of Viola/Cesario serves as a catalyst for their self-discovery.\n\nHowever, this interpretation is nuanced, and it's hard to say whether Olivia's feelings for Cesario are genuine or a product of societal norms. Her swift rejection of Cesario and subsequent acceptance of Sebastian as a family member suggest that she's more interested in appearance than substance. This raises questions about the nature of attraction and the societal pressures that shape our desires.",
            "The brutality of German colonial rule has been well-documented, particularly in its treatment of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, the German colonial empire was a complex entity with a diverse array of policies and ruling styles that varied across its territories. This was also reflected in the provision of education, which differed greatly from one colony to another. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a population of educated and literate Africans, which was a far cry from the situation in other colonies. \n\nIn contrast, South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark picture. Unlike East Africa, where the government took a proactive role in establishing state schools and educating the locals, the task of native education in South West Africa was largely left to missionary societies that received limited support from the government. However, the government did invest heavily in the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing state schools and regulating missionary schools to a greater extent. This dichotomy in educational policies had a lasting impact on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, the overwhelming majority of the population in South West Africa remained uneducated and illiterate. Various factors, including social, political, and economic, contributed to this divergent experience.\n\nDespite a wealth of literature on education in the German colonial empire, much of it is in German and deals with the early twentieth century. These studies were primarily focused on describing the educational systems in the colonies. Later works written in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies and in-depth analyses of specific aspects of education, highlighting the differences between various colonies. One of the most notable works on this topic is Cohen's study, which compared the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa and shed light on the factors that led to their differences. Cohen attributes the distinguishing features of South West Africa's educational system to the large settler population.\n\nSouth West Africa stood out among Germany's colonies due to its relatively temperate climate, albeit largely arid desert in some areas. The European population in the colony reflected this, with nearly 15,000 whites residing in South West Africa by 1913, compared to around 5,336 in East Africa, which had the next largest settler population.",
            "It's been a century since popular music exploded onto the scene, and in that time, it's branched out into an astonishing array of genres that's left us all scratching our heads trying to keep up. I mean, who can keep track of all the sub and sub-sub genres within genres like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk? The sheer number of them is mind-boggling. But if I had to pick one genre that's evolved into a behemoth, it's heavy metal rock, which has become the most diverse and expressive genre of all over the past four decades.\n\nWhat sets heavy metal apart is its incredible range of emotions, with a dark and brooding tone that often leans towards the heavier side of the emotional spectrum. And it's not just the music itself - it's the people who make it, too. As soon as heavy metal started gaining traction, musicians began experimenting with it, pushing the boundaries and creating their own sub-genres, which in turn spawned even more sub-sub-genres. It's a never-ending chain of innovation and creativity that continues to this day.\n\nFast-forward to today, and we're faced with an overwhelming array of heavy metal niches that make it hard to pin down exactly what heavy metal is. It's like trying to capture a wild animal - it's constantly evolving, incorporating elements from other genres, and adapting to new influences. But at its core, heavy metal is a movement, not just a genre. So, what is it, exactly?\n\nAt its heart, heavy metal is a movement defined by darkness - a sonic reflection of our deepest, most primal emotions. It's a music of excess - more bass, more volume, more violence, and more theatricality. It's an art form that demands skill, with musicians who can really play their instruments and make it shine through in their music. And, as you might expect, it's also a movement that's deeply tied to the world of substances - the psychedelic magic of the 1970s gave birth to some truly groundbreaking music, as musicians used their experiences with psychedelics as a catalyst for creativity.\n\nHeavy metal's visceral qualities are unmistakable - a raw, unbridled energy that's never been seen before in popular music. It's drawn inspiration from the darkest corners of the human experience, as well as from the Romantic Era's emphasis on emotion and drama. Take, for example, the lyrics of Helter Skelter, a song that's often cited as one of the first heavy metal tracks. It's a brooding, intense piece that captures the highs and lows of the psychedelic experience - and it's a nod to the darker side of the Beatles' sound, which was responding to the Rolling Stones' own darker tone. It's a testament to the power of heavy metal to push boundaries and challenge the status quo.",
            "Several decades before the Surrealist artists began conjuring up their dreamlike works, Henri Rousseau was meticulously crafting his own dreams – both figuratively and literally. His 1910 masterpiece, 'The Dream', not only depicts a woman lost in awe of the wonders she discovers in her dream world but also serves as a reflection of Rousseau's own aspirations as a painter. For years, he had fantasized about receiving recognition, acceptance, and admiration from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, but this dream came with a daunting internal conflict: should he conform to the established styles of painting to gain approval from the art world he idolized, or should he take the road less traveled and forge his own unique path?\n\nBefore delving into the world of 'The Dream', it's essential to grasp Rousseau's personal story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France, Rousseau came from a family that enjoyed a comfortable, middle-class lifestyle. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer, and although Rousseau received no formal art training, he worked as a gabelou, or municipal toll service employee, for 40 years. The misnomer 'douanier', or customs inspector, followed him throughout his early career. The tragic loss of his first wife, Clémence, and their eight infant children left Rousseau with his young daughter Julia and overwhelming grief. Painting became his solace, allowing him to escape into a new life. Unlike his contemporaries, who romanticized the peasant class in their art, Rousseau, a folk painter, drew from the everyday experiences of his own class.\n\nRousseau's yearning for acceptance in the art world is understandable, given his unconventional background and late start in his career. As he began producing art at the same time as other talented and renowned modern artists, he didn't receive the recognition he deserved until the emergence of fellow artist Matisse. According to art historian Jan Gordon, the two artists, while competitors in the art world, differed not only in style and subject matter but also in their motivations. While Matisse sought to avoid painting in a clichéd manner, Rousseau aspired to create conventional works that would earn him a place among the esteemed Artiste Français.",
            "A profound connection has long been perceived between ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. As I ponder this, I'm reminded of John Keats' timeless words in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" where he asserts, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty— That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" It's almost as if we're wired to appreciate ethics and aesthetics without needing explicit instruction or education. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe rather than dictate; we study morality and beauty to decipher what makes a piece of art or literature beautiful or an action moral, rather than establishing set rules for evaluating or creating great art or behavior.\n\nTo put it bluntly, no amount of criticism or analysis can fully grasp the essence of what's good or beautiful. Discussing the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might revolve around aspects like composition, context, or symbolism, but these don't really capture why it's a masterpiece. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often respond with something like, \"There's just something about it\" before elaborating on the subtleties. I believe that both art and ethics can't be reduced to a mere description of their attributes. Flannery O'Connor's insight, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way,\" resonates with me. No matter how thoroughly we dissect a work of literature, there's always a lingering, ineffable quality that remains. Similarly, ethics has this enigmatic quality, as Wittgenstein suggests, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\"\n\nThis transcendent nature of both ethics and aesthetics is what ties them together in my mind. I propose that it's this elusive \"something\" – this je ne sais quoi – that makes art and morality so powerful. This connection point between them is further strengthened when we consider literature, which impacts us on a deeply personal level, though it's impossible to fully articulate. As McKean astutely observes, \"What most distinguishes literature from other arts, what is unique about it, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are less relevant to other arts, like music, but they seem as pertinent to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "As I gaze upon the contemporary Germany, it's undeniable that this country is a powerhouse, a fusion of unique cultures from the shadows of the Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. The same cultural heartbeat can be felt from Cologne along the Rhine River, right through the nucleus of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden, nestled on the Elbe River. Given its distinct culture, it's no wonder that modern-day Germany, as we know it, is an amalgamation of various sources and tribes. \n\nGermany's ancestral roots, known as Germania, have been a topic of heated debate among scholars and historians. The origins of the name are shrouded in mystery, with some attributing it to a Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, who were allegedly referred to as Germans prior to their crossing of the Rhine and battling the Gaulish forces, as described by Tacitus. On the other hand, Julius Caesar first used the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, where he clashed with Germanic tribes that frequently crossed the Rhine under dubious pretenses. Caesar borrowed the term from the Gauls themselves, using it to distinguish between the conquered Gauls and the unconquered Germanic tribes. In his first book on the Gallic Wars, Julius Caesar notes, \"The Germans, who reside beyond the Rhine, are constantly at war with the Gauls... They engage in almost daily battles with the Germans.\" Others propose that the name might be derived from the Gaulish language, referring to a neighboring tribe. Yet another theory suggests that it originated from the spear used in warfare, known as a \"ger\" (Oxford English Dictionary, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating that the Germans were loud and boisterous.\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus, in his AD 98 writing \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" penned a vivid account of the origins of the Germans, stating, \"I consider the Germans to be aboriginal, with no significant intermingling with other races through immigration or cultural exchange. Why would anyone leave Asia, Africa, or Italy for Germany, with its rugged landscape, inclement weather, and stern demeanor, unless it was their homeland?\" (Tacitus, 98) It's unlikely that the Romans would have voluntarily left their empire to settle in Germania, at least not yet. Instead, they would send expeditions into Germania to acquire goods and resources, and occasionally lead military campaigns, but ultimately return to their vast empire. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they resided on the periphery of the Roman Empire, trading their goods and skills by serving in the Roman army (Ozment, 2005, p. 17).",
            "I stood frozen, my mind a complete blank slate gazing at the scene before me. It was as if I'd entered a state of numbness, a practiced detachment that allowed me to observe without judgment or emotional response. Thoughts whizzed in and out of my head in rapid succession, leaving behind a trail of mental fragments that refused to coalesce into anything tangible. My consciousness was in a state of fluid motion, effortlessly processing the visual stimuli in front of me without the burden of abstract thoughts.\n\nI'd once taken art lessons from a talented artist, who recommended I read 'The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.' The book promised to unlock the secrets of perception and artistic expression, and I'd been fascinated by drawing since I was a six-year-old. The technique that resonated with me was the art of framing – literally placing a mental border around the subject, stripping away extraneous details to reveal the essence. It was a fundamental lesson in simplifying complexity.\n\nAt that moment, I couldn't shake off the feeling of being overwhelmed by the mess in front of me. A wealth of sensory information bombarded my senses, refusing to allow me to mentally impose the artist's frame. It was as if I was staring at a kaleidoscope of colors, textures, and shapes, with no clear focal point. Picasso's blue period, Monet's love of greenery, and the Italian Renaissance masters' use of vibrant colors all flashed through my mind, but I couldn't muster the confidence to claim my own artistic vision.\n\nMy fingers instinctively reached for the pencil, and with a surge of creative energy, I began to sketch. My hand moved with a life of its own, as if channeling the pure creative energy at its core. Water swirled, serene and smooth, like a fleeting moment of beauty. But in a sudden, jarring shift, my hand smacked the toilet handle once more, and I was left staring at the same stubborn, brown, and uncooperative package. It was a far cry from the art that had begun to unfurl in my mind's eye.\n\nWith a deep breath, I gripped the mop, set my feet shoulder-width apart, and stared at the offending mess. A faint scowl creased my brow as I pondered the carelessness of the person who'd left this mess. My hand moved toward the wall, grasping the toilet paper, and I deliberately stilled my thoughts, ready to confront the unglamorous task at hand. I dipped my hand slowly into the bowl, the unexpected intimacy of the moment a fleeting echo of a creative spark that seemed to have abandoned me.",
            "Thanks be to the statistics.  For the past few years, we've all witnessed the alarming rise in teenage fatalities behind the wheel. Several factors converge to create this tragic trend among the youngest American drivers. The National Institutes of Health reveal that one aspect of the problem lies in the teen brain's inability to handle the perils of driving. Inexperience is another elephant in the room, causing not only deadly crashes but also a higher rate of rollovers, speeding, and vehicles veering off the road.\n\nThe statistics are even more disturbing when considering the presence of peer passengers. It's a well-known fact that teens often travel with friends, but a study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center highlights a striking correlation: the more youthful the passenger, the greater the risk of traffic accidents.\n\nIn an effort to mitigate this issue, California and other states have implemented provisional driver's licenses, limiting the hours teens can drive and prohibiting other minors as passengers. However, in my opinion, these measures are merely band-aids on a much larger problem. The real issue is that, as a group, the youngest drivers are statistically incapable of adequately managing the risks and responsibilities associated with driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman agrees, suggesting that 18 is still too young for a full driver's license. His research indicates that those under 19-20 years old have a strong desire to take risks for the thrill of it, making it sensible to delay driving until this tendency subsides.\n\nIf we continue to issue driver's licenses to young teens, we'll not only see more fatal accidents but the death toll will likely skyrocket in the next few years. By 2010, the Baby Boomer generation's children will come of age and millions of new teen drivers will flood the roads. \n\nImplementing legislation to address this issue would be straightforward. Schools could continue to offer driver's education classes to initiate the learning process, but no one under 18 should be allowed to operate a vehicle. A provisional permit could still be issued before a full driver's license, with a specified number of practical driving hours required. This number could be based on the hours already mandated by most states (for instance, California requires 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult). Uniform, national legislation on this matter would be a reasonable and effective way to safeguard teens across the country.\n\nThis proposed legislation is far from novel – it's a long-overdue solution to a pressing problem.",
            "Browsing through the Library of Congress's archives, I stumbled upon the early Edison films and decided to give them all a watch. I was particularly drawn to the trick films – there were fifteen of them, hailing from 1895 to 1901. As I delved into these films, I discovered that they relied on creative editing to create illusions. My analysis mainly focused on dissecting the poetic techniques used in most of these trick films and identifying the innovative characteristics that emerged in a few of the later ones. The trick films of the time were largely confined to a set-bound format, shot within a frontal proscenium, utilized long and medium shots, and stuck to the rule of one shot equals one film.\n\nHowever, there were a few daring films at the turn of the century that broke free from these conventions by introducing new elements such as multiple shots. One thing that stood out about these trick films was their consistent use of an interior set within a frontal proscenium frame. The camera remained stationary, refusing to pan or zoom in on the action. This composition was a common trait of early films, drawing inspiration from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. As a result, figures in these trick films were limited in their movement, typically moving side-to-side rather than forward or backward. A classic example can be seen in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where the actors enter from the right side and move horizontally along the frame, only to disappear from view without the camera following them.\n\nThe use of the frontal proscenium style also led to a reliance on long shots and, occasionally, medium shots. Close-ups were a rarity in these trick films, adhering to the theatre and vaudeville tradition where the audience would see the entire performance within the frame. Since the actors remained in the middle ground, close-ups were never a possibility. In most early trick films, one conceptually cohesive shot equaled one physical film, limiting their length to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. This also restricted the use of tricks in storytelling, as most focused on short, vaudeville-style illusions like magic, disappearing acts, and switching tricks with minimal narrative. However, it's worth noting that in a trick film, a single \"shot\" can actually be composed of multiple joined shots to create an illusion of apparition or disappearance. Take The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) for example – a closer examination reveals the moment when the physical shot of Mary's severed \"head\" begins, despite the entire film being conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a true blue advocate for the Republican cause. Though his primary occupation as an agriculturalist and his brief stint in politics didn't quite add up to a long resume, they did cement his reputation as a steadfast champion of personal freedom and government restraint. His passion for an agrarian way of life was the backbone of his stance on governance, and his devotion to this cause colored his opinions on autonomy, constitutionalism, and the judicial system. He firmly believed that the United States had a unique opportunity to create a utopian system, unencumbered by the baggage of a native tradition, allowing the nation's founders to establish a system of self-governance that truly represented the people.\n\nTo Taylor, the natural rights of man were sacrosanct, and he believed that they were all interconnected - that if one right was denied, the value of the others would be diminished. He argued that these rights should be beyond the reach of the government, which he saw as prone to abuse by those with physical prowess and malicious intent. In his view, the so-called \"state of nature\" was a harsh reality, but one that should be mitigated by the establishment of a civilization that valued fairness and justice over might and greed.\n\nTo achieve this ideal society, Taylor believed that a government must be constructed to account for the dual nature of humanity - both good and evil. He was unwavering in his conviction that government would always reflect the virtues and vices of its people. According to him, good principles were those that protected private property, fostered agriculture, and discouraged unchecked capitalism, and a government founded on these principles would function equitably, regardless of who was at the helm. However, self-interest, which he saw as the driving force behind human behavior, was only a problem when it prioritized individual gain over the common good.\n\nTaylor, like many of his fellow Republicans, was a staunch advocate for a strict construction of the Constitution, with a Federal government that possessed only the powers explicitly granted to it by the document. He believed that a limited government was inherently more efficient and less prone to tyranny, but also warned that a literal interpretation of the Constitution without regard for its original intent was a recipe for disaster. Furthermore, he saw the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, as it more explicitly enshrined the sovereignty of individual states rather than a unified nation.",
            "Looking at Figure 17, we noticed a dramatic decline in commuter log submissions in the third month of our project. It was a bit disheartening and we're still trying to figure out what caused it. Winter is probably to blame, at least in part, as folks on our New England campus are less likely to bike or walk during the cold months. Then there's the end of the fall semester, which keeps everyone busy with schoolwork, grades, and more, making it easy to overlook the commuter log. The holiday season also sets in around December, with a long break for students and faculty, so it's no surprise that many people don't need to come to campus that month. We do see a lull in activity after the break, which resumes in late January. But, we still can't explain the low number of submissions in February. Perhaps it's just the natural ebb and flow of a project, where the initial excitement eventually wears off. To combat this, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a special campaign that got people back on board and resulted in a spike in log submissions that month. Our challenge, however, was to maintain momentum despite the inevitable decrease in engagement, as well as the holiday and semester breaks that come with higher education. \n\nAnother obstacle we faced (and one that's inherent in any alternative commuting project) is that people love the freedom, independence, and flexibility that comes with driving their own cars. It's deeply ingrained in our culture, making it essential to offer incentives for switching to alternative modes of transportation. We offered a range of prizes, from gift certificates to local restaurants and coffee shops to massages and bookstore discounts. It would have been interesting to see how bigger prizes, like a nice bicycle or a hybrid car, might have affected participation. Perhaps if we'd offered increasingly valuable prizes throughout the project, we could have prevented that dip in engagement. Our prize offerings remained the same throughout, but if we'd announced bigger and better prizes, like a bicycle in December and a hybrid car in January, we might have seen participation and engagement increase instead of decrease.",
            "I'm still getting used to the wild world of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), but one thing's for sure - they're a game-changer. Essentially, an ETF is like a security that tracks an index, commodity, or basket of assets, just like an index fund, but with a twist: it trades like a stock on an exchange. This means you get the benefits of diversification, like owning a piece of every stock in the fund, without the hassle of individually managing each one. Plus, you can sell short, buy on margin, or even purchase as few as a single share in any transaction. And the best part? The expense ratios of ETFs are often significantly lower than those of the average mutual fund. However, there are some downsides to consider, such as paying a commission on each trade, just like when buying or selling individual stocks. \n\nBut with the sheer variety of ETFs available, it can be overwhelming to choose the right one. That's why it's essential for savvy investors to evaluate whether the touted benefits, like diversification, actually live up to the hype. In this case, we're taking a closer look at the ETF IHF and comparing it to its top 10 holdings to see if owning a single ETF is worth it. We'll also examine whether a portfolio of these 10 stocks can provide similar benefits to a diversified portfolio of the same stocks. To keep things manageable, we're focusing on the top 10 holdings, which account for a whopping 63.58% of the ETF's assets.\n\nTo gauge how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF as a whole, we've calculated their contributions to the portfolio's beta and return, assuming a portfolio made up entirely of these stocks in the same proportions as the ETF. The results are telling: a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings would yield a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. What's more, the beta of this portfolio is 0.12 lower than the ETF's, suggesting a potentially more stable investment. However, there's a chance that these results might not be statistically significant.\n\nTo get a better understanding of the data, we've also calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100% to compare them to the ETF IHF. This will give us insight into the potential risks and rewards of investing in these stocks, and whether a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings is a viable alternative to the ETF.",
            "I've always been fascinated by Edgar Allan Poe's \"Dream-Land,\" one of his self-proclaimed masterpieces. The poem's use of the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56 is particularly intriguing. My research led me to Virgil, who first used the term to describe an island north of Britain, believed to be the edge of the known world. However, there's a more contemporary source that sheds light on Poe's familiarity with German authors. Poe was indeed enamored with Goethe's writing.\n\nThis connection is significant because it highlights Poe's influence from Goethe. As Karl J. Arndt notes in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" Poe's poem bears a striking resemblance to Goethe's work, suggesting that Poe may have been drawing inspiration from the German author. \n\nOxford Companion to English Literature credits Goethe as a celebrated writer of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" which was published in two parts, with the first installment coming out in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe's passing. Within the second part of \"Faust,\" there's a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem tells the story of a king whose wife gives him a goblet before her untimely death. The king's descent into grief and despair is marked by excessive drinking, and he ultimately decides to join his wife in death.\n\nThe similarity between the King of Thule and the character in \"Dream-Land\" is striking, with both figures being haunted by loss and finding solace in drink. Interestingly, Goethe's \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe's use of the term Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" \n\nPoe references Thule twice in his collected works, using the phrase \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and employing it as a bookend in \"Dream-Land.\" When read alongside Goethe's \"The King of Thule,\" the two poems can be seen as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a desolate landscape of Thule, marked by darkness, loneliness, and a world devoid of color. This echoes the King of Thule's story, who has lost his will to live after the passing of his wife.\n\nGiven Poe's admiration for Tennyson, it's likely that he would have been familiar with Goethe's work. Poe's statement on Tennyson aside, it's clear that he would have been exposed to Goethe's writing through various reproductions and adaptations that followed the original publication.",
            "Here's the juicy stuff that could help a customer injured from slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store get a hefty chunk of change from the store manager.  I'm talking punitive damages, baby - the kind that can make someone's wallet weep. So, under California law, is this possible? Can Jennifer Palmer, the injured party, show that the store manager, Paul Martin, acted with malice when he ignored the spill for a whole half-hour because he was too busy eating dinner? \n\nRest assured, a judge won't dismiss her claim without a fight. To win punitive damages, Palmer needs to show that Martin recklessly disregarded the harm that could come from not cleaning up the spill. She can argue that the manager should have known better since multiple customers had slipped on the same spot in the months leading up to her accident. And let's not forget, he still didn't do squat to fix it despite all those prior incidents.\n\nNow, some might say Palmer's argument about Martin's actions being despicable is a bit of a stretch, but it's not entirely unreasonable given the facts. Six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009 and no action taken to prevent them? That's just not cool.\n\nLet's take a trip down memory lane. On October 13th, 2009, around 5 pm, an employee, Rich Wayne, told Martin about the applesauce spill, but he blew him off, saying he was on dinner break. Another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also warned Martin about the spill 15 minutes later, but he gave her the same brush-off. Guess who slipped and fell on the spill at 5:30 pm? That's right, Jennifer Palmer, and she ended up with a serious back injury. It's no wonder she's suing D&D Markets for compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nIn California, if a defendant acts with \"oppression, fraud or malice,\" a plaintiff can win punitive damages for a breach of obligation not arising from a contract. The law defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm or, if no intent, the defendant's actions were so bad that they demonstrate a \"willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" So, was Martin's inaction a malicious act? Did he know the probable harm that could come from not cleaning up the spill, and did he deliberately ignore it? According to the courts, a defendant's actions are malicious if they knew the likely consequences of their actions and chose to ignore them.\n\nIn this case, the courts might just decide that Martin's actions were indeed malicious, and Palmer could be on her way to a fat check. But we're not there yet. It's time to see if we should file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim. Stay tuned!",
            "It's been almost four years since I took a course in Islam at CBC, and the topic of whether Islam is a hostile religion remains a pressing issue.  I firmly believe that this question is more relevant now than ever, especially considering the media's shift in perspective since 9/11.  I recall the way the media used to portray Islam and extremists as hostile entities, only to swing to the opposite end of the spectrum and become excessively tolerant of Islam in America.  It's hard to imagine that in 2001, a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, with an openly Muslim background, could have even been considered viable.\n\nThe Biography of the Prophet Muhammad has left me with a compelling narrative that contradicts the man I thought I knew from history.  According to my understanding, Muhammad was supposed to be a figure who forced people to convert to Islam after conquering tribes and imposing his rule.  However, the biography paints a completely different picture – that of a humble, misunderstood, and humbled individual who was shunned by others but ultimately drew followers who saw the truth in his teachings.  This portrayal has left me questioning the validity of the history I thought I knew.\n\nThe parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the supposed miracles of Muhammad are remarkable.  One of the most striking examples is the story of feeding forty men with a small amount of mutton and milk, which seems eerily similar to Jesus' miracle of feeding the multitudes.  It's this type of writing that makes me suspect the authors were trying to portray Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove anything, but lived a life of truth and miracles.  This approach undermines the significance of Jesus' life and ministry, making it seem like a pale imitation.\n\nI also find it interesting that the biography features many stories that aim to provide proof of 'witness' or show how people converted to Islam of their own accord.  However, these stories often rely on third-party accounts, which diminish their credibility in my eyes.  While the authors intended to provide evidence of the truth, it only makes the stories seem more suspect and less authentic.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this work is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly figure, portraying him as humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  History, however, contradicts this image, and I can't help but wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true story behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "As Christianity progressed beyond its roots, the teachings of Jesus and the core beliefs he held during his lifetime were cast aside in favor of a more developed theory. When viewed from a broad perspective, a pattern emerges of Christianity gradually straying further and further from its authentic origin. Today, an increasing awareness and a shift towards progression are underway, revealing a growing desire for a return to the true essence of the faith. While traditionalists may cling to established doctrine, they may not be numerous enough to influence the broader masses. As time passes, however, a historical awareness will grow among Christians, driving a yearning to distinguish between the original intent of Christianity and the doctrines that were added over time. This reversal of trends will eventually lead to a movement that sheds its accumulated layers, gradually stripping away the extraneous to reveal the pure essence of Jesus' original message. A gradual clock-like motion will be seen as people return to the core principles Jesus instilled, untainted by the additions of subsequent thinkers.  As this forward-thinking movement sweeps through the United States and Europe, expect to see a shift from the current divergence towards a more uniform and cohesive understanding of the faith. The church, as an institution, will remain a guiding force, but the turbulent diversity of Christendom will give way to increased uniformity across regions, denominations, and divisions. History is replete with examples of such reversals – consider how Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire, only to see the empire eventually adopt Christianity. Similarly, the United States transitioned from slavery to African-American leadership. In the future, Christianity will undergo a profound reversal, undoing the accumulated history in the quest for its authentic roots, and in the process, shedding its diversity. A crucial aspect of this shift will be reinterpreting Jesus' words as metaphorical rather than literal statements. Looking back, we find the seeds of Christianity in Judaism, which flourished as a divinely revealed, monotheistic faith before the Roman Empire's control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population was not a homogeneous entity; it was fragmented into various groups, including the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common folk.",
            "As I reflect on the timeless classic, The Jungle, I'm struck by the harsh reality that deep down, humans are often driven by self-interest and a desire for personal gain, leaving those in lower positions to fend for themselves. This is starkly illustrated in the novel, particularly through the lens of the factory owners and managers. Their only concern is to expand and thrive, no matter the cost to others or the environment. They're depicted as callous and ruthless, with no regard for the devastating impact of their actions, as Upton Sinclair masterfully conveys through the vivid image of the factories' towering chimneys belching smoke into the air, symbolizing the destruction they cause. The owners and managers show no empathy for the harm their endeavors inflict on the people and animals living in the shadows of Packingtown, nor do they care about the well-being of their employees, whom they treat as nothing more than means to an end. They're driven by a relentless pursuit of profit, as Sinclair so poignantly puts it: \"So from top to bottom, this place is a seething cauldron of jealousy and hatred, devoid of loyalty and decency, where a man is nothing more than a commodity to be exploited for a dollar.\" During the era in which the book is set, workers were at the mercy of their employers, forced to toil in inhumane conditions with little to no protection or support. The system was designed to prioritize profit over people, leaving workers to suffer and struggle in a desperate fight for survival. The novel suggests that the workers were, in effect, treated as slaves, their lives hanging in the balance of their employers' whims, with no escape from the crushing system of Packingtown.",
            "Many authors employ various tactics to evoke a particular sentiment or attitude in their readers. The effectiveness of these techniques can vary, but F. Scott Fitzgerald masterfully weaves them throughout his novel, The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs seemingly mismatched adjectives and nouns to conjure a specific atmosphere around a subject. He also assigns meaning to symbols and later utilizes them to convey a particular mood. This technique is particularly evident in his use of colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink.\n\nIn The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald meticulously builds up associations for white/gray, then skillfully employs them to elicit a certain response from his readers. The significance he attributes to white/gray is uniformity, with white generally representing a more refined and upper-class connotation, while gray carries a sense of age and faded elegance. Fitzgerald sets the stage for these meanings early in the novel through repeated references to both colors. We see this in the way Daisy and Jordan are constantly \"in white\" (8) – everyone, it seems, is donning white attire: Nick sports \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby's party, Tom wears a \"white shirt\" (36) when meeting Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only time white attire is absent is during Nick's initial impressions of Gatsby's party, where the halls are \"gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further defines these colors by associating them with everyday, mundane subjects: as Nick heads to work, he navigates \"the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the names of people at Gatsby's parties become \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's timetable, and Catherine's apartment is likened to \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\" – epitomizing uniformity.\n\nFitzgerald then uses these established meanings to convey a sense of unimportance or uniformity in certain subjects. This process begins with Daisy. After a prolonged period without significant use of white/gray, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster\"; readers start to perceive Daisy as less of a distinct character and more of a uniform entity, a mere aspiration for Gatsby (74). Fitzgerald employs this technique repeatedly to reinforce this impression of Daisy as a uniform addition, as seen in the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18) and her appearance in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "The San Diego County is a veritable garden of plenty, thanks to its sun-kissed climate that makes it an ideal place for agriculture. The region is blessed with a diverse array of crops, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There's a thriving market for organic community supported agriculture food in the area, with many local organizations boasting lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand, and some farms even offer tours of their operations, along with opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This type of farming operation allows landowners to tap into government programs while preserving the land's natural beauty, creating a win-win situation for both the environment and their bank accounts.\n\nHowever, organic farming isn't without its challenges. It requires more labor and management to maintain soil health without relying on chemicals, which can lead to greater costs and losses compared to conventional farming methods. Small organic farms often lack the efficiency of large-scale operations, making it harder to compete in the market. Other practices that benefit wildlife, such as planting cover crops and removing invasive species, also incur additional labor costs. As a result, landowners in this scenario might seek financial assistance or expert guidance to maximize their profits while preserving the land's biodiversity.\n\nThe chosen property is a 160-acre plot adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. The land is a mix of chaparral, non-native grassland, and oak woodland, nestled next to the Cleveland National Forest within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. This plan, still under review, aims to protect over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered or declining, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and several butterfly species. The area has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This particular piece of land was likely used for grazing and wood production for many years, given its original homestead patent status.\n\nTo explore the options available to a small farmer in this area, I chose a property from a real estate website and researched government programs that could help mitigate costs and support wildlife-friendly farming practices. As a model for what someone farming this land might aim to achieve, I looked at an existing organic farm in the same region.",
            "The intricacies of culture play a pivotal role in any negotiation, but they're often misunderstood or oversimplified. Culture is a complex web of nuances that can be just as easily defined by what it's not as by what it is. It's not a monolith, nor is it uniform or one-dimensional. Statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are woefully broad and reductive. A more productive approach for a negotiator is to grasp the significance of a culture in relation to the specific issue at hand and how its attitude will impact the negotiations. When engaging with a foreign culture, we inevitably view it through the lens of our own, and comparisons inevitably arise. \n\nDelving into a foreign culture often requires a multidisciplinary approach, encompassing everything from historical context to understanding its biases. Rather than judging or trying to change a culture, it's essential to accept it for what it is and navigate its boundaries, particularly in high-stakes negotiations where a weaker bargaining position is at play. When operating in unfamiliar territory, a deep respect for local traditions and customs can be a game-changer in breaking down cultural barriers and moving the negotiation forward.\n\nIt's a common misconception that culture is solely bound by national or international borders. In reality, many companies within a given nation have their own distinct corporate cultures that can be just as influential as any national culture. This can manifest in everything from dress codes and communication styles to hiring practices and employee values. Even within the United States, corporate cultures vary wildly from company to company, and within companies, there are often regional and urban-suburban differences that showcase the diversity of thought within a particular societal culture. Don't be fooled by a uniform exterior – it's often a sign to dig deeper.\n\nValues are the key to understanding the underlying dynamics of a culture. If a culture places a high value on saving face or communal harmony, a negotiator will likely avoid publicly embarrassing their company or superior in pursuit of a deal. Conversely, a culture that prioritizes driving a hard bargain won't necessarily be willing to settle at the earliest opportunity. By considering these cultural nuances before the negotiating table, you'll be better equipped to navigate the complexities of cross-cultural negotiation. But it's equally important to learn about your opponent on a personal level to make the negotiation a success.",
            "We often hear the phrase, \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God,'\" which originates in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and is famously referenced by St. Anselm in his argument for the existence of God. Interestingly, Thomas Aquinas seems to share this sentiment, and as we delve into their arguments, it's worth assuming they're both correct in their belief, specifically in the God of the Bible. If we were to consider a different concept of God, it would skew our comparison, as their arguments are centered around a particular idea of the divine. Therefore, let's begin by accepting their shared premise for the sake of clarity.\n\nWhile both authors bring up valid points, neither provides a comprehensive foundation for faith in God. To illustrate this, let's break down St. Anselm's basic argument. He suggests that understanding and proof of God can be found within ourselves, through introspection and faith. According to Anselm, because our minds inherently grasp the concept of God, we can't effectively conceive of his nonexistence. On the surface, this idea might be wordy and unclear, but in essence, Anselm is saying that the truth about God is within our own minds and doesn't require external evidence. This concept of accepting the truth without empirical proof is often referred to as faith in Christian texts.\n\nIn stark contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas proposes that God's existence can be proven solely through reason and empirical evidence, eliminating the need for faith altogether. This idea would be beneficial in evangelism, as it would allow for the recruitment of new converts based on logic rather than blind faith. Aquinas presents five logical arguments supporting God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for his existence. Think of it like this: if you're told you're missing a puzzle piece and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can infer the features and existence of the missing piece without seeing it.",
            "Twenty-five hundred years ago, a prince destined to become the revered figure known as Buddha was born. Throughout the course of his life, he renounced worldly pursuits and achieved enlightenment, paving the way for the emergence of Buddhism. This ancient faith has undergone significant transformations since its inception, a phenomenon evident in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is an integral part of the culture. Despite the fact that Buddha never preached about such festivities, this event brings together monks and laypeople alike, reflecting the dynamic evolution of the religion. From superficial customs to its fundamental tenets, the Theravada Buddhist community has had to adapt its principles over time. This metamorphosis can be attributed to factors both within and outside the Buddhist fold, encompassing a range of influences, from the benign to the hostile.\n\nTo facilitate this discussion, it's essential to understand the key terms that will be used throughout. Internally, an internal force refers to any influence originating from within the Buddhist community, regardless of one's monastic status. Conversely, an external force is any influence stemming from non-Buddhists. As for hostile and benign forces, a hostile force is any influence that seeks to harm or damage the Buddhist community, often driven by a negative perception of the faith. A benign force, on the other hand, is an influence that neither wishes to harm nor help the community, though it might inadvertently do so.\n\nNow, let's delve into the core of Theravada Buddhism, exploring the fundamental doctrines that form its foundation. At the heart of the faith lies the concept of the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma encompasses the Tripitaka, a collection of sacred texts divided into three baskets: the Sutta Pitaka (containing the Suttas), the Vinaya Pitaka (outlining disciplinary rules), and the Abhidhamma Pitaka (dealing with metaphysical concepts). Central to these metaphysical notions are the principles of Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering in life), and Anicca (the impermanence of everything). Recognizing these concepts holds the key to breaking free from Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, and ultimately transcending lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). In the Vinaya Pitaka, guidelines for daily life are established, with five precepts for laypeople (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not engage in misconduct, and I shall not consume intoxicating substances) and additional disciplinary rules for monks. At the heart of Buddhism lies the four noble truths, a fundamental doctrine that encompasses the reality of suffering (Dukkha), the causes of suffering (attachment), and the possibility of overcoming suffering.",
            "For over five decades, the United States and Mexico were locked in a bitter rivalry that would leave a lasting impact on their relationship. From 1836 to 1893, tensions simmered between the two nations, with the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848 being the turning point. This conflict saw the United States emerge victorious, claiming Texas and the American Southwest as its own. However, clashes between the two nations continued to erupt over the years, finally dying down just before the outbreak of World War I.\n\nAt its core, the rivalry between the United States and Mexico was fueled by deep-seated differences over issues like religion, culture, and tradition. Material interests also played a significant role in exacerbating the tensions between the two nations. It's a pattern we see repeated in many other rivalries between nations that share a border, where clashing interests inevitably lead to the development of opposing positions.\n\nDavid M. Pletcher noted that the United States had long-standing diplomatic issues with two countries in particular: Mexico and Cuba. Given their geographical proximity to the United States, it's no surprise that these nations have historically found themselves at odds with America. In contrast, many other Latin American countries have enjoyed more harmonious relations with the United States.\n\nThe religious divide between the United States and Mexico was a significant factor in their rivalry. Sally Frahm pointed out that Americans were long opposed to Catholicism and monarchy, which created a deep-seated distrust between the two nations. This ideological struggle was reminiscent of the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, but in this case, the stakes were tied to religious differences rather than politics. The lingering effects of English-Spanish animosity only served to further complicate the relationship between the two nations.\n\nAccording to Diehl and Goerts, there were 17 notable disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry period. Many of these disputes centered on territorial issues, including border raids and frontier problems. Bandits and outlaws from both sides of the border posed a major challenge that wasn't fully addressed until both countries deployed military force to secure their borders.\n\nAs Schmitt noted, the rivalry between the United States and Mexico finally began to dissipate as Mexico became increasingly dependent on its northern neighbor. The shift in American ambitions from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico marked the beginning of a new era in their relationship, one that would eventually lead to a more peaceful and cooperative relationship between the two nations.",
            "Fifteen years ago, my life took an unexpected detour when a mysterious illness struck, leaving me disabled and out of the workforce. I was a nurse, a career I had chosen for its stability after hearing the constant mantra in my youth: \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\" My true passions lay in science and journalism, but I opted for nursing to ensure a secure future. \n\nNow, at 46, I'm single, with nothing to show for it, relying on Social Security Disability for survival. It's a daily struggle, a relentless assault on my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Yet, amidst this chaos, I've come to realize that the one constant in my life is the unwavering support of my family and a handful of true friends. When disaster hits, you're not as invincible as you think. \n\nMy point is that life is full of unexpected challenges, big and small. No matter how well-prepared you are, some storms are too intense to weather alone. \n\nWhile it's essential to take responsibility for our own lives, I strongly believe we need to shift our focus from solely relying on the government to learning to trust and support one another. Rather than building individual shelters, we should strive to build a community where neighbors look out for each other. \n\nThe concept of rugged individualism, often touted by Conservatives, is a myth. It was compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources that saw our ancestors through the tough times, not self-reliance. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it alone; they worked together.\n\nBy all means, be prepared. I've invested in a disaster kit, first-aid supplies, and other essentials. If you have the means, consider starting a small farm or investing in a wood stove. However, don't overlook the most vital survival tool of all – building strong relationships with those around you. Get to know your neighbors, and together, you'll be better equipped to face life's uncertainties.",
            "We often ponder the enigma of why organisms evolve in the manner that they do. Are there unseen forces at play that shape the course of evolutionary change? While D'Arcy Thompson astutely observed in 1917 that the task of defining organic forms in mathematical terms was still a distant dream, we're still far from grasping this complexity today. However, recent advances in mathematical modeling have begun to shed light on the intricacies of mollusk development, particularly in the realm of skeletogenesis (Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research seeks to leverage mathematical modeling, in tandem with experimental studies, to unravel the underlying mechanisms driving the direction and magnitude of evolutionary change in Prunum.\n\nTo achieve this, we're examining how X-radiographic images of Prunum species can be used to quantify parameters that can then be input into software programs like CerioShell (Stone, 1995) to model hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. These models enable us to explore the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum, providing a framework for understanding macroevolutionary events within this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a spiral tube that traverses 360 degrees of space over time. This spiral path is composed of whorls, which are formed by the animal's growth and are considered to be centered around an imaginary axis, known as the columella. The speed at which each whorl enlarges can vary, and a continuous line separating each whorl is referred to as a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the body whorl, while the spire consists of all the whorls except the last. The apex, or tip, of the spire marks the beginning, while the base represents the opposite end. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from different perspectives, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. Typically, shells are depicted in apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.\n\nTo count whorls accurately, one must first view the shell from the apical perspective and identify the starting point of the first suture. A line can then be drawn, dividing the shell into two parts, and whorls can be counted from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures that unfold through time and space as the animal adds to its shell. By tracing the path of the aperture using the center coordinates of each whorl's aperture and its horizontal and vertical radius, we can create a mathematical representation of this trajectory. This mathematical formulation enables us to manipulate parameters and modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "I've been pondering the stark reality of neonatal and infant mortality rates in Indonesia, which have remained stubbornly stagnant for a decade. As the country makes strides in meeting Millennium Development Goals such as water and sanitation targets, its progress in child and maternal health lags woefully behind. The reasons for this disappointing trend are multifaceted and point to a pressing need to fortify the overall health system rather than relying on piecemeal interventions.\n\nIndonesia has made some progress in increasing the number of births attended by skilled health workers, with a commendable 72% now meeting this benchmark. However, this statistic is somewhat misleading, as it still includes traditional workers like midwives who are unable to provide medical interventions in complicated cases, leading to a disproportionate number of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage. Furthermore, there's been a concerning decline in the percentage of children under five receiving treatment for diarrheal cases from a health professional, and data on postnatal care is woefully inadequate.\n\nAnother worrisome trend is the relatively low cesarian-section rate of around 4%, which is compounded by the stark disparities between urban and rural areas – 7% in cities versus a paltry 2% in rural regions. This stark contrast highlights the issue of unequal access to healthcare services, with urban areas receiving preferential treatment. Vertical equity is another concern, with a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, suggesting that the poor are facing significant barriers in accessing healthcare due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nAs we consider the next steps to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the fundamental question is how to address the chronic shortage of services. Should Indonesia focus on developing targeted programmatic approaches or strengthen its overall health system without pandering to the specific needs of pre and post-pregnancy care for mothers and their children? While programmatic approaches may seem attractive, they have their drawbacks. For instance, investing heavily in one area can divert resources away from other critical areas, leading to a brain drain of human resources and duplication of services. This not only wastes resources but also creates an administrative nightmare with excessive forms and paperwork.",
            "Victorian novels are infamous for their meticulous attention to detail and their focus on the lives of the aristocracy of the time.  However, two novels that break away from this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both works incorporate an air of mystery and an affinity for the bizarre, traits that were uncommon in novels of the period, but which serve to strengthen the characters within each story, offering a deeper look into their motivations and emotions.\n\nAs Oliver Twist navigated the treacherous world of Victorian London, a maelstrom of bewildering ideas swirled inside his mind. The echoes of his encounters with Sikes and Crackit lingered, their voices arguing in his ears, while his own thoughts struggled to regain focus. The sound of gunfire shattered the silence, and Oliver was swept up in a whirlwind of confusion as unseen forces bore him away. Amidst the chaos, a gnawing sense of pain and discomfort gnawed at him, refusing to let him escape.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, these unsettling occurrences often manifest as dream sequences or dreamlike states, revealing hidden facets of Oliver's psyche and the turmoil that wracked his inner world. When Oliver relives the moment of his near-fatal shooting in chapter 28, the scene unfolds with a dreamlike quality, as if he's reliving the trauma all over again while desperately seeking help. This passage highlights Oliver's powerlessness in the face of the events that have unfolded, and the dire state of his health, which is reflected in his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, numbing all his senses as an unseen force bears him away, leaving him to relive his despair in a state of constant fear rather than shock. This event raises questions about whose actions led to his misfortune, as it's clear that Oliver's fate was not of his own making. The scene also implies a growing sense of defeat in Oliver, as if Fagin's influence has broken him, forcing him to accept his despair and rendering him unable to react.\n\nThe passage from Wuthering Heights reads like a haunting refrain: \"The day passed – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\" This sense of time's fluidity, where day and night blur into one another, creates a sense of disorientation, underscoring the turmoil that pervades the story. The passage speaks to the novel's use of time as a fluid, malleable concept, where the boundaries between reality and fantasy blur, and the characters are left to navigate the uncertainties of their own lives.",
            "I still remember my time working in an after-school program, where I was tasked with tutoring elementary students in a variety of subjects, but my true passion lay in helping them with reading and English. One student in particular, a young boy named Adrian, really stood out to me. He was around third or fourth grade, and I was assigned to work with him because he was struggling to read. What struck me as peculiar was that some letters he could pronounce flawlessly, while others left him completely stumped – it was as if he was speaking a different language. Given that he was Latino, I assumed that might be the issue, but his English was spotless. I spent many sessions with him, trying to figure out the problem, until the day his mother walked into the room. Her only language was Spanish, and I attempted to communicate with her using my limited Spanish skills. It was a defining moment – I realized that Adrian's struggles weren't about reading, but rather, he didn't know the English alphabet. I hope he's found success since then.\n\nSharing this story highlights the complex issue of the language barrier in schools, especially here in California. It's a problem that's often overlooked, but it's not always as straightforward as we think. Even a child who speaks perfect English can struggle with reading, as I learned with Adrian. We all agree that this issue exists, so what's the solution? In Adrian's case, it was as simple as extra English reading tutoring, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for students who barely speak English, it's a much more complex problem.\n\nThere's no single answer, but rather a combination of approaches that work together. The dual language system is a great concept, not just for kids who speak Spanish as their first language, but for all children. Research shows that students in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Many people fear that this system is a waste of resources, but it's not true. If we implemented this approach as a standard, all children would benefit from it. So, how do we make this happen? Do we require teachers to be bilingual? That's unrealistic, but we can hire bilingual aids, tutors, or whatever we want to call them, to support our students.",
            "From the time we're young, many of us are taught that there's something greater than ourselves, something that transcends our understanding. Some of us are sent to Sunday school, while others seek answers within themselves or explore the spiritual paths our parents have laid out for us. Some accept these teachings without question, while others reject them entirely, choosing to forge their own paths. We might adopt one set of values, only to later discard them for another. Ultimately, our search for meaning leads us down a winding road to discover a part of ourselves through our unique perspectives on spirituality, seeking a guiding light to lead us out of the darkness and into the light.\n\n[The memory of that rainy evening still lingers.] My dad and I sat on our front porch, listening to the rain drum against the tin roof above. We both smoked cigarettes, lost in our own thoughts. The rainwater pouring from the gutters drowned the plants at the edge of the porch, and my dad's eyes gazed out into the downpour, a mix of introspection and distant recollection. His frame seemed smaller, his clothes hanging loosely, and his hair was thinner than I remembered. That's when I realized he was struggling – and I was struggling too. I couldn't bring myself to talk about how much I'd miss him, as acknowledging it would make it all too real. Instead, I hugged him, sat down beside him, and joined him in gazing out into the rain.\n\nMy dad passed away that December, just five days before my twenty-second birthday. The treatments had prolonged his suffering, but at what cost? I couldn't fathom it. As I lay alone in the dark, I didn't pray. If a higher power existed, I thought, it had long since stopped listening to me. \n\nI refused to watch him slip away. I chose to remember my dad through his life, not his final moments. I knew him better than anyone, and I was certain he wouldn't have wanted me to be there for his passing. I curled up in my bed for three days, waiting for the news. And yet, no one even called.",
            "The Gothic Novel: A Timeless Contradiction \nI still chuckle when I think about Ian Watt's clever description of the Gothic Novel as an 'oxymoron for Old-New.' It was as if he was trying to capture the essence of this peculiar literary beast that has been both revered and ridiculed throughout history. Critics have attacked the Gothic genre for lacking depth, yet praised it for its ability to evoke the 'terrible sublime.' (Burke) The genre has been around since the 18th century, when Horace Walpole first penned The Castle of Otranto, a true pioneer in the proto-Gothic genre. By combining the 'old' theatrical elements of medieval romances with the 'new' novelistic format, Walpole created something entirely new - a Gothic Story. \n\nAs I delve into the world of Gothic literature, I notice how it often relies on throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. It was a time when the word 'gothic' was used to describe everything from people to styles to time periods, often with a hint of nostalgia and a dash of disdain for the 'modern' world. It's fascinating to see how Walpole merged the grandeur of the Gothic with the intimacy of the novel, creating a reading experience that feels both ancient and modern. \n\nOne of the key aspects of Gothic literature that has captured my attention is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of training a proper knight is woven throughout the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is particularly significant in Gothic writing because it represents a bygone era of bravery, honor, and competence - an era that many writers, like Walpole, felt was sadly lacking in their own time. By romanticizing the 'gothic past,' writers like Walpole aimed to critique their own society and, perhaps, even hint at the future evolution of Gothic to Romanticism. \n\nAs I read through The Castle of Otranto, I'm struck by the character of Frederic, a prince who embodies many chivalric traits. His description is a masterclass in Gothic tropes: a prince, a victim of tragedy, and a man shrouded in mystery. The image of the 'gallant and courteous Knight' is exaggerated, of course, but it's a perfect example of how excess was used to create a sense of drama and tension in the Gothic genre. As I ponder the complexities of Gothic literature, I'm reminded that even in its contradictions, there's a timeless beauty to be found.",
            "I've witnessed the evolution of supply chain management, a world of intricate processes that weaves together raw materials, production, and distribution to meet the ever-changing demands of customers. The term supply chain management was coined by Keith Oliver in 1982, a consultant with an eye for efficiency. Oliver described the delicate dance of planning, implementing, and controlling the supply chain to deliver customer satisfaction in a swift and seamless manner. \n\nAt the heart of supply chain management lies six essential elements: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These building blocks enable business managers to craft an experience that leaves customers wanting more. \n\nProduction is the foundation upon which the entire supply chain stands. It's the stage where the 'when,' 'why,' 'where,' and 'how' of product creation are carefully laid out. Managers must tune in to the market to grasp what customers crave. The market is the barometer that indicates the customer's desires, and by analyzing it, managers can decide what products to produce, how many to produce, and where to produce them. The goal is to meet customer demands while ensuring the best quality and volume.\n\nOnce production is underway, managers focus on scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. Every detail is crucial in this process, and mishaps can cost the company dearly in the long run. I've seen firsthand how having a clear process in place can make all the difference at companies like Wal-Mart and Target, where every aspect of the business, from employee attire to shipment reception, is meticulously planned.\n\nSupply is the second vital element in the supply chain equation. It involves strategic decisions about a company's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. Managers must decide which divisions of production are best suited for specific products, taking into account the equipment, personnel, and specialties required. Outsourcing work to other companies can be a smart move, as it enables the creation of velocity – the ability to deliver quality, flexibility, and low costs.",
            "A haunting message lurks on a street corner, Ellen Page's cardboard sign held high, the Sharpie-written words 'Hitler is alive in Burma' a stark reality check. Burma, now Myanmar, has been under the iron grip of a ruthless military junta since 1962, when the country was seized through a brutal coup d'état. The echoes of 2007 still linger, when a wave of protests swept the nation, known as the Saffron Revolution, in honor of the saffron-colored robes worn by the courageous Burmese monks who led the charge. What began as peaceful gatherings soon turned into a bloody conflict, with the military junta unleashing its wrath on monasteries and foreign journalists, including Japanese photojournalist Kenji Nagai, who fell to their brutality on September 27th, 2007. The official death toll may be 13, but defector Colonel Hla Win revealed a chilling truth: the real number of victims could be in the thousands.\n\nThis isn't a relic of the past. The world has been witnessing this tragic tale for millennia, as governments pursue power and silence dissent with ruthless abandon. From ancient Roman emperors claiming divine right to rule, to Japanese emperors deified as gods, to our own modern-day leaders who seem to answer to none, this dark chapter has been etched in human history. We see echoes of Tiananmen Square in 1989, where students, intellectuals, and labor activists dared to challenge the authorities, and the death toll may never be known for certain – 200 to 3,000, depending on who you believe. The Rwandan genocide, Hitler's Third Reich, and countless other atrocities serve as grim reminders of the horrors that unfold when governments turn against their own people.",
            "The unyielding legacy of Duke Ellington in the realm of jazz can be attributed in large part to his remarkable longevity and the boundless creative influence he exerted through his orchestra. Although his piano presence is understated in many of the compositions selected for this particular task, as a composer Ellington masterfully crafted complex, rich pieces that showcased the unique talents of individual band members. He skillfully wove the framework, allowing soloists to improvise freely, while also penning tightly orchestrated phrases that highlighted the distinct styles of his musicians. In doing so, Ellington successfully emphasized the ensemble's overall tone, creating original and coherent sounds to match each piece. Through his profound understanding of the individual players' sounds and how they blended together to form a cohesive unit, Ellington was able to produce some of the most groundbreaking and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\n\nA notable example of Ellington's innovative approach to sound is evident in his use of voice as an instrument, as illustrated in his early piece, Creole Love Call. This twelve bar blues, characterized by its slow and deliberate pace, features six distinct choruses, each showcasing Ellington's ability to complement the style of his soloists. The piece commences with a call and response between voice and reeds, with the voice beginning smoothly and melodically before transitioning to a rougher tone towards the end. This is followed by a muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes. Subsequent choruses feature a sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase, and a full band echo of the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections. The climactic fifth chorus sees the reeds initiating the call and response in a high register, supported by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections. The sixth and final chorus returns to the structure of the first, with call and response between voice and reeds, and in this instance, the voice takes on the sound of the \"growl\" technique, soloing as an instrument. A brief tag concludes the piece with a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is a hallmark of his work, as evident in subsequent compositions such as Hot and Bothered and It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing). In Hot and Bothered, Ellington seamlessly combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color, using a call and response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing to create a rich and complementary sound. Similarly, in It Don't Mean a Thing, Ellington employs Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to great effect, introducing the melody on muted trombone in a way that showcases the unique qualities of Nanton's playing.",
            "I'd been grappling with this unshakeable feeling of incompleteness since I was 14, when the world opened up and I found myself in the midst of teenage chaos. Three years later, at 17, I was still searching for something, though I'd narrowed it down to a desire for connection with someone rather than a mere object. Yet, I remained unimpressed by every boy who crossed my path, as if I was immune to the usual high school allure. I couldn't help but wonder what was behind this peculiarity, and I spent years mulling over various theories. But nothing ever added up, leaving me stuck in this cycle of self-doubt and curiosity.\n\nMy home life was a tranquil oasis amidst the turmoil. My parents were the epitome of calm and composure, rarely arguing with each other or with me – the only exceptions being when I pushed the boundaries of my independence and individuality. They were a peaceful couple, but I was the wild child in our household, bringing a spark of energy and playfulness that made me likable and admired by all who knew me.\n\nBut today was different. As I wandered through the house, searching for inspiration, the sound of my mother's distressed cry pierced the air, followed by the unmistakable tone of her voice. Panic set in as I sprinted towards the kitchen, my heart racing with every step. \"Mom! Mom, what's wrong?!\" I exclaimed, my voice trembling. I rushed into the room to find my mother lying on the ground, wincing in pain, her voice barely above a whisper. I dropped to her side, offering what little support I could. \"Ouch... sweetie, I... need you to take me to... the hospital.\" The words tumbled out in short, labored breaths, and I knew she was in agony. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up,\" I said, trying to keep my voice steady. My mother directed me with her hands, and I was grateful for every ounce of strength I'd built up through yoga and exercise, which now allowed me to lift her and carry her to the car.\n\nThe hospital was a flurry of sterile smells and worried faces, but my focus was solely on my mother's well-being. I quickly settled her into the backseat and drove, my mind racing with worry. At the hospital, I rushed to get her help, calling out to the doctors as they quickly gathered around. Soon, a rolling bed appeared, and my mother was whisked away for immediate attention. I was left to sit, my anxiety simmering just below the surface.\n\nAs it turned out, my mother had slipped off a step stool while trying to retrieve a vase from the highest cabinet. It was a simple misstep, but one that had sent her tumbling to the ground.",
            "It's a well-established fact that embracing the Mediterranean Diet, characterized by its emphasis on plant-based foods, monounsaturated fats, and moderate alcohol intake, can have a profound impact on our health. In fact, a plethora of studies have demonstrated that adhering to this diet can significantly reduce the risk of chronic heart disease and stroke. The study in question sheds light on the relationship between adherence to the \"Mediterranean Diet\" and the risk of heart-related issues, specifically chronic heart disease, stroke, and stroke mortality.\n\nIn essence, the Mediterranean Diet is a modified version of its precursor, with a greater focus on consuming plant-based proteins like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, while minimizing animal products and saturated fats. The results of prior studies have been promising, showcasing the diet's effectiveness in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. However, research has been lacking in the area of stroke and stroke mortality.\n\nOur investigation involved analyzing data from the Nurses' Health Study, which included 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, with no prior history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Over a period of 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, we computed an \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\" based on self-reported food frequency questionnaires. These questionnaires underwent validation studies to ensure accuracy. We also accounted for various lifestyle factors, including body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and leisure-time physical activity.\n\nTo minimize random variation and better represent long-term dietary habits, we calculated cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated questionnaires. We adjusted for potential confounders like age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use. Our analysis revealed that a higher aMed diet score was associated with a lower risk of heart disease and stroke in the study participants. Specifically, women with the highest aMed quintile had a 29% lower risk of chronic heart disease and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile.",
            "Fast forward to 2007, and it seemed like the world had hit rock bottom. The United States of America found itself in the midst of a devastating financial crisis. Joblessness skyrocketed, the housing market imploded, and many of America's largest corporations were left reeling. The question on everyone's lips was: how did this catastrophe unfold, and how can we prevent it from happening again? To put it bluntly, the financial crisis was the result of reckless and naive policy decisions that forced banks and firms to dispense sub-prime loans into a fragile financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were coerced into underwriting and repackaging these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were left scrambling for capital, and the chaos was transferred to the repackaged mortgages they'd sold, and ultimately, the entire economy.\n\nLooking back, the roots of the crisis stretch as far back as 1999, during the Clinton administration. The President was eager to secure a second term, and his team relaxed lending restrictions to boost his popularity. This move set the stage for the impending sub-prime crisis seven years later. In 1999, Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported on the pressure being felt by Fannie Mae, the nation's largest home mortgage underwriter, to offer loans to low- and moderate-income individuals. The government-subsidized corporation was also under pressure to maintain its rapid profit growth. Holmes astutely foresaw the consequences of these actions, warning of a potential government rescue similar to the savings and loan industry debacle of the 1980s. As we now know, ill-advised lending would ultimately lead to a catastrophic economic meltdown.\n\nA perfect storm of factors contributed to the economic freefall, including the complex and convoluted nature of modern mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were all extensively used in the years leading up to the crisis, intertwining various sectors of the economy with the housing market. U.S. households and financial markets as a whole became over-leveraged in the housing market, leaving them vulnerable to even the slightest price fluctuations.\n\nThe housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had invested in these mortgage-backed securities were left reeling. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, which accounted for approximately 30% of the country's GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at fire-sale prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to transition to commercial banks subject to intense regulatory oversight. Fannie and Freddie were in $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "I'll never forget that notorious section of my story where I'm tempted to unleash a torrent of exposition, stretching my writer's wings to impress, but often ending up putting my readers to sleep or sending them fleeing in frustration.  Dr. Merlin has been known to slam her monitor in exasperation when she finds herself stuck in a sea of Too Much Information, and I'm talking the not-very-fun kind.\n\nExposition is the enemy of a good story.\n\nMy fellow writers already know the age-old adage, \"Show, don't tell,\" but I still find myself succumbing to lengthy passages where nothing happens or, worse, too much happens.  Exposition is that pesky inner voice urging me to tell the reader everything, from the history to the minutest details, to get to the good stuff (not to be confused with the inner voice whispering to reveal every character's backstory, no matter how insignificant).\n\nExposition is essentially regaling the audience with a straightforward account of what's happening, often in dry prose.  In film, this plays out when one character unloads a wealth of information on another, à la \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nLet's take an example.  When reading a story, I'm informed that the heroine met her beloved at a specific time and place, got married in a grand celebration, and witnessed her husband's tragic murder.  I wouldn't expect this entire sequence to take up two pages, with both characters only getting a few lines of dialogue.  I'd expect the author to spend some time developing the husband's character, showing through his words and actions how deeply he adored his wife, and I'd expect the heroine to reveal, through her thoughts and actions, how his presence enriched her life.  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow me to become emotionally invested in his fate and gain insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, the depth of their bond, and clues about her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams reflected through his eyes.  I'd mourn his loss with her, growing more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, I'd expect more substance behind the bare bones of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, it's my job to provide that substance.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, and presses on*)  Sometimes it's tempting to rush past certain details.  Perhaps I'm introducing a new character with a storied past: he used to be in the Air Force, now runs the night shift at a gas station, has been married twice, has no kids, loves fishing on weekends, secretly dreams of owning the station someday, and starts his day with Eggs Benedict.",
            "I caught two local broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio, the first of which was NBC 4's live newscast on August 13, 2011. The leading story was about a heinous crime: a man named Shad Hostettler had stabbed his wife, though her name wasn't mentioned. They aired his mugshot, and he looked like the embodiment of pure evil. The news team devoted about two minutes to the story, which was still unfolding. I think they allocated an adequate amount of airtime to this distressing event. \n\nThe next story was about an early morning shooting involving 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically injured, and no arrests had been made or suspects identified at the time. The SWAT team was on the scene, investigating the crime. This story seemed rather rushed, and I suspect it might have been due to the fact that the victim was a black man from a predominantly black neighborhood. It's a phenomenon I've observed for years: when minorities are victims of a crime, they often get shortchanged in the news coverage. In contrast, if a white child or adult is kidnapped or a victim of a crime, the media goes into overdrive; but when it's a minority person, they're lucky if they get a mention.\n\nThe next story dealt with a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. The news team provided details about the possible location of the incident, and it was determined that a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle had hit the aircraft. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for any information leading to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nThe next story focused on the impending rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They mentioned that the temperatures would remain in the mid-to-low eighties for the weekend. The brief length of this story was likely due to the anchor wanting to use it as a teaser to keep viewers engaged.\n\nThey also covered a story about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The perpetrator was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt and estimated to be around six feet tall and 150 pounds. I found it peculiar that they devoted so much attention to his racial description and how dark he was.\n\nAnother story was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas-based marijuana kingpin who had conspired to distribute large quantities of the substance to Ohio. One thing that caught my attention was that instead of stating his 25-year prison sentence, they mentioned \"300 months.\" I'm not sure if they thought that made it sound harsher or if it was just a stylistic choice. They also highlighted that he was a Hispanic man, but I'm not convinced it was relevant to the story.",
            "There's a mystique surrounding brotherhood - an unbreakable bond that defies time and circumstance. Within its depths, a complex tapestry of emotions unfolds: love, pride, jealousy, cruelty, and more. Brothers have a unique understanding of one another, a connection that transcends the shallow relationships we form with others. When you look at your brother, you see a reflection of yourself, a truth that becomes glaringly evident in the most trying of times. This bond isn't always easy to navigate, and the emotions that accompany it come with a steep price. Understanding this fraternal link requires embracing the consequences that follow, and it's only when we can gaze into our brother's eyes that we truly see ourselves - not as others perceive us, but as we truly are. Our actions and their aftermath reveal our character, a truth that's difficult to confront but essential to growth.\n\nThe novel \"The Scarlet Ibis\" masterfully explores this theme, weaving a story of two brothers who navigate the intricate web of emotions tied to their bond. Against the backdrop of a lush, vivid landscape, these two boys embark on a futile journey, their relationship marked by bitter disappointment and intense pride. The climactic scene is a poignant example of this complex dynamic, and only one brother emerges unscathed. Through the protagonist's direct characterization and his interactions with his brother, as well as the narrator's nuanced perspective, we gain insight into the complex feelings that shape the protagonist's world and inform his actions.\n\nAt its core, the protagonist's actions are driven by one dominant emotion: pride. From their early adventures together to their final, fateful excursion, he grapples with resentment towards his little brother, Doodle. The protagonist had envisioned a brother who could share in his passions, a companion to explore the world with. He dreamed of racing to Horsehead Landing, perching in the top fork of the great pine, and learning the skills he'd mastered through trial and error. But Doodle's fragile health makes such exploits impossible, crushing the protagonist's fantasies and leaving him feeling bereft. The depth of his disappointment is evident in his disturbing thoughts of suffocating his brother, a bleak testament to the darkness that can lurk beneath the surface of even the most loving relationships. Yet, when Doodle smiles, the protagonist's heart softens, revealing a glimmer of hope and a love that's hard to deny. This dichotomy speaks to the complexity of brotherly love, a bond that's both beautiful and fraught with challenges.",
            "We're constantly amazed by the intricate complexity of the human brain, that unpredictable and creative information-processing machine. As technology has evolved from its humble beginnings to the modern era, so too have the metaphors used to describe our brains. We've seen it likened to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, a book, and most recently, a computer - each era's comparison shedding light on some aspect of its function. However, it's essential to remember that these analogies are helpful but limited, and can lead to misconceptions if taken too literally.\n\nWhen it comes to processing information, it all starts with the sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, or light into electrical signals. These signals are continually transformed by the brain's algorithms through both bottom-up and top-down processing. To illustrate this, imagine looking at a picture of a black box against a white background. Bottom-up processing involves breaking down the image into basic components like color and orientation, ultimately determining that you're seeing a box. Meanwhile, top-down processing uses the results of earlier steps to speed up your recognition of the object, helping you decide whether it's a box or a hole in the background.\n\nAs information is processed to a certain point, an attention filter kicks in, deciding which signals are most important and which cognitive processes they should be routed to. For example, you may process every blade of grass when you glance down at your shoes, but your attention filter helps you tune them out. Conversely, you might pick out your name in a noisy room. This process repeats at various stages, with the results of processing influenced by attention at each step.\n\nBefore the brain can process information, it must first store it. There are three primary types of memory: sensory, working, and long-term. Information is first encoded, and different types of encoding suit different sensory stimuli. When it comes to verbal input, for instance, it can be encoded based on its structural appearance, phonetic sound, or semantic meaning. Once stored, information must be maintained, and research suggests that working memory, which holds information for about 20 seconds, relies on an electrical signal looping through a specific series of neurons for a short time. Long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are numerous theories about how knowledge is organized within the brain, each with its unique perspective. Some are based on how humans retrieve memories, while others draw from computer science and neurophysiology. One such model is the semantic network, which proposes that concepts are represented by nodes and linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, the concept of \"chair\" might be connected to \"table,\" which in turn is linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley's dystopian novel, Brave New World, serves as a scathing critique of the impending dangers of unchecked technological advancement and the capitalist system that perpetuates it. The novel depicts a society where people value collectivity above individuality, with its citizens conditioned from a young age to prioritize immediate gratification above all else. The characters are unwitting pawns in a grand game, trapped within a narrow ideology dictated by the all-powerful World Controller. When viewed through the lens of Marxist ideology, Huxley's work reveals a deep-seated distrust of the emerging economic systems of his time.\n\nOne of the primary targets of Huxley's satire is the capitalist system, which is reflected in his use of Marxist concepts such as homogeny and reification. These terms highlight the ways in which capitalist systems can lead to the suppression of individuality and the uniformity of the masses. The novel's depiction of the lower classes, known as Deltas and Gammas, is particularly telling, as they are conditioned to prioritize consumption and indulgence above all else, thanks to the pervasive use of hypnopædia. This manipulation is masterminded by the World Controller, who maintains a stranglehold on the lower classes through ideological control.\n\nThe concept of hegemony – where a dominant group exercises control over a subordinate group – is also evident in Brave New World. The upper classes, comprising Alphas and Betas, are born with the knowledge of this manipulation but do little to challenge it, further solidifying the grip of capitalism on the society. The novel's portrayal of relationships between characters is also noteworthy, as they are superficial and lack depth. This may suggest that the rise of technology and capitalism has stripped individuals of their free will and emotional expression, reducing love and other intense emotions to mere surface-level interactions.\n\nThe novel's characters often focus on physical appearance, with men commenting on women's physical attributes and women discussing their romantic conquests with little shame. This limited emotional landscape serves as a commentary on the socioeconomic effects of capitalism, where individuals are content with their place in the hierarchy and conform to societal expectations. Their unwavering obedience to the status quo is a testament to Marxist theories on the proletariat, who are conditioned to believe in their own superiority as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform to the norms of their peers.",
            "It's been about two and a half years since I stepped onto the University Park campus, and four and a half semesters of navigating its twists and turns have taught me that getting around can be a real challenge. As a freshman, I was stuck in an East Halls dorm room, the farthest I could get from the action without venturing onto the stadium or Bryce Jordan Center grounds. Commuting from Stuart Hall to classes in buildings like Willard, smack in the center of campus, was a 25-minute trek – and that was on a good day, weather permitting. But I've learned that it wasn't always this way. I spoke with an alum not much older than myself, who shared that the East Halls used to be isolated from the rest of the campus by a massive expanse of unused land. Fast-forward to today, and that open space has been transformed into sports fields, sleek new buildings like the Creamery and health services center, and rows of apartments. As the campus continues to sprawl, getting from one place to another is becoming increasingly difficult.\n\nThat's when I realized the obvious solution – the humble bicycle. But it's not just about having a bike; students need to actually ride them, and the campus needs to be designed with cyclists in mind. I chatted with a friend who'd taken a several-year break from biking, only to rediscover its joys. \"Bikes are the way to go,\" he said. \"For a while, it wasn't cool to ride, but it's the only way to get around.\" Not only is biking great exercise, but it's also the most efficient way to travel. With a hearty bowl of oatmeal and a bit of effort, you can cover 30 miles or more. As an off-campus student, I now live just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. Buying a bike was one of the smartest decisions I made this year. Classes in Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from my place, are a breeze to get to on two wheels – just 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The problem is, Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas, isn't always a bike-friendly stretch. Walking, on the other hand, is a viable option, but with my schedule, I just don't have the time. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option, sucking up an extra 30-40 minutes of my day – over two and a half hours every week. That's time I just can't afford to spare."
