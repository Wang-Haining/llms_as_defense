            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "As I navigate my educational path in social work, I envision a career within the Division of Family and Children Services, dedicated to supporting children who've endured abuse or neglect. My goal is to provide a helping hand to troubled families, and in doing so, I aim to instill a sense of service, respect, and a commitment to fostering meaningful relationships. These core values aren't merely essential for social workers; they're deeply ingrained in my own personal philosophy.\n\nGrowing up, I've always felt an innate desire to aid others, yet I was uncertain about the career path that aligned with my passions. Throughout high school and college, I witnessed individuals escaping their problems through denial, while others employed coping mechanisms that didn't exactly inspire confidence. The situations I saw sparked a fire within me, and I decided to pursue a degree in Psychology. Even after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I still felt uncertain about my career path. That all changed one summer, when I visited a friend who was hosting a 16-year-old boy who'd fled his abusive home. I soon discovered that this young individual had reached out to the authorities for help. The next day, I accompanied the police to his parents' residence, where I shared my concerns and introduced myself as a recent Psychology graduate. The police asked me to speak with the parents, citing a lack of jurisdiction. When I questioned them about the situation, their nervous demeanor and excuses for their son's actions only solidified my resolve to pursue a career in social work, focusing on helping children navigate \"simple\" disputes within family dynamics.\n\nFor me, social justice is another crucial value in the field of social work. We often tout the importance of individuality, yet our society often pressures people to conform to archaic norms. I, on the other hand, relish being an individual and refuse to be bound by the need to fit in. Throughout my high school and college years, I made my stance against social injustices whenever I could: I dyed my hair unconventional colors, wore clothing that expressed my personality, got piercings that defied traditional standards, joined the GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and spoke out against racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it. Social justice is a cause I'm deeply passionate about, and I'll continue to advocate for it.",
            "I've dug into the complex world of insomnia, examining the biological and sociocultural models that attempt to grasp this elusive disorder. The biological model zeroes in on the genetic factors we inherit, as well as the medical aspects of health that influence our sleep patterns. On the other hand, the sociocultural model delves into the environmental factors, like our racial, ethnic, demographic, and socioeconomic backgrounds, which all play a significant role in our sleep habits.\n\nInsomnia can be categorized into three primary types: primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders linked to other mental health conditions, and those caused by medical issues or substance intake. The primary sleep disorders include Dyssonmias and Parasomnias. Dyssonmias encompass a range of difficulties, such as Primary Insomnia, where we struggle to fall asleep or stay asleep, and Primary Hypersomnia, which makes it hard to stay awake for extended periods. Narcolepsy, on the other hand, involves cataplexy and automatic REM sleep. Parasomnias, meanwhile, are sleep disorders associated with behavioral and physiological anomalies, like Nightmare Disorder and Sleepwalking Disorder.\n\nNow, let's dive into the biological model, which focuses on the genetic and physiological aspects of sleep disorders. Research has shown that neurons in the hypothalamus, specifically those containing orexin, play a crucial role in regulating our sleep-wake cycles. A study involving mice discovered that phenotypic GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons are responsible for sleep-wake states. When these receptors are activated, it promotes sleep, while their inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and increased sleepiness. The study found that a GABAB agonist, baclofen, increased sleep time in mice, suggesting that this genetic and environmental factor can also affect humans. This implies that a problem or absence of this receptor could disrupt our ability to sleep soundly without medication.\n\nThe sociocultural implications of this study are significant. If the GABAB receptor is inherited, it could play a crucial role in regulating our sleep patterns, and any alterations to this receptor could naturally disrupt our sleep, impacting various aspects of our lives, from school and career to daily tasks and focus. This highlights the complex interplay between our genetic makeup and environmental factors in shaping our sleep habits and overall well-being.",
            "I'm diving into the complex world of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD). It's time to break down the basics. To start, let's define CAPD: it's the way our brain processes what we hear. More specifically, it's a condition where the central nervous system (CNS) has trouble deciphering auditory information. This doesn't mean that someone with CAPD is hard of hearing; it's that the brain's ability to filter out background noise, separate words, and understand the sequence of sounds is impaired.\n\nAs I dug into the history of CAPD, I found that the concept of auditory imperception dates back to the 1950s. Researchers like Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for children with communication disorders back in 1954. The field continued to evolve, with Kimura introducing dichotic testing and a model to explain the brain's auditory processing in 1961. A 1977 national conference further sparked research on CAPD.\n\nPeople with CAPD struggle in various ways: they might have trouble pinpointing the source of a sound, distinguishing between multiple sounds, recognizing patterns, or picking up on subtle changes in speech. It's also common for one sound to be masked by another, making it difficult to interpret the sequence of auditory information. They might even struggle to synthesize sound clues, which can impact their ability to respond meaningfully.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD requires a systematic observation of listening behavior and performance on tests of auditory function. Audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other professionals use a range of measures to evaluate auditory-related skills. These might include questionnaires, surveys, and observations of how the individual responds to different stimuli. The challenge is that there's no single diagnostic tool that consistently yields accurate results, and the cause of CAPD remains unknown.\n\nTests often present the individual with multiple sounds simultaneously and ask them to differentiate specific items, such as words or numbers. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the brain's response to these signals.\n\nAs a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom, understanding CAPD can help you better support students with this condition. By being aware of the challenges they face, you can adapt your teaching methods to accommodate their unique needs.",
            "Twelfth Night appears to reveal a paradoxical truth: while adopting a disguise can be an effective means of deception, it ultimately requires a person to shed that facade, lest they lose themselves in the process. However, breaking free from a deception can come at a steep price – social isolation. This leaves the individual facing a difficult choice: protect their own identity or preserve relationships with those around them. The consequences of being discovered can be severe, ranging from indifference to outright offense.\n\nThe theme of deception through gender role reversal poses a particularly complex set of questions. Why do individuals feel compelled to abandon their true selves and assume an alternate identity? In Viola's case, her motivation is rooted in self-preservation: \"I'll take you to a trusted leader in this town, where I've found safety, thanks to the kindness of those who've helped me serve this noble count.\" (Act 5, Scene 1, lines 247-249) Having arrived in an unfamiliar land, Viola resorts to disguise to safeguard herself from potential threats. Her ruse succeeds, but it also isolates her from the women who could offer emotional support.\n\nViola's dual identity creates an added layer of complexity, as she's so convincing in her masculine guise that Olivia becomes infatuated with her, mistaking her for her twin brother, Sebastian. Furthermore, Viola struggles with repressed romantic feelings for Orsino: \"You've told me countless times that you'll never love a woman like me,\" (Act 5, Scene 1, lines 260-261) suggesting that deception can, in fact, facilitate the exposure of submerged emotions.\n\nWhile this may seem progressive by modern standards, Twelfth Night can be seen as a commentary on how deception can force individuals to confront their true desires. Certain passages hint that Olivia and Orsino may have unexplored feelings that are only revealed through Viola's disguise. Olivia's swift shift from romantic interest in Cesario to familial affection suggests that she may be parodying the societal norms of her time, judging people based on appearances rather than substance.",
            "The brutal nature of German colonial rule has been a topic of discussion among historians, particularly in regards to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, the German colonial empire was a complex entity with diverse policies and ruling styles, much like its varied geography. Education, too, was a patchwork across the colonies, with some receiving better support than others. When the British took over German East Africa in 1919, they found a population of educated and literate Africans, which stood in stark contrast to other colonies. The German colonial efforts in Kamerun and elsewhere were similarly praised by authors of the time.\n\nBut German South West Africa, now modern-day Namibia, was a different story altogether. Unlike East Africa, where the government invested heavily in state schools and education, South West Africa left the education of locals largely to missionary societies that operated on limited government funding. The government did, however, provide significant resources to educate Europeans in the colony, establishing state schools and heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. This approach had lasting effects on South West Africa, with its legacy continuing long after German rule. While other German colonies had significant numbers of educated Africans, in South West Africa, the majority of the population remained uneducated and illiterate. The divergent experiences of South West Africa were influenced by a complex array of social, political, and economic factors, which this paper aims to explore in more detail.\n\nExisting literature on education in the German colonial empire is vast and mostly written in German, with a focus on describing the colonial education systems during or shortly after the colonial period. Later works, written in English, expanded the discussion through comparative studies and in-depth analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted the significant differences between the educational systems of various German colonies, including a notable comparison between South West Africa and East Africa by Cohen. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa played a significant role in shaping the colony's educational system.\n\nThe climate of South West Africa, characterized by a moderately temperate climate with arid desert regions, attracted a relatively large European population. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, far outnumbering the European population in other colonies, such as East Africa, which had only 5,336 settlers.",
            "Fast forward to the past 100 years and the sheer explosion of popular music genres is staggering. It's a jungle out there, and with so many branches sprouting off the main tree, it's tough to keep track of them all. Sub-genres like death metal, grindcore, and power metal have sprouted from the likes of rock, country, jazz, and folk, each with their own unique offspring. I'd argue that heavy metal, in particular, has become the most dynamic and expressive genre of all, with a range of emotions that skew towards the darker side. It's as if the genre has an insatiable appetite for innovation, with artists pushing the boundaries and creating their own niches, which in turn give rise to even more sub-sub-genres.\n\nToday, heavy metal has evolved into a behemoth, with so many sub-niches that it's challenging to define what heavy metal even is. It's been shaped by influences from other genres, but its roots run deep. To truly understand the metal music that permeates our airwaves, we need to grasp the essence of the metal movement and why it's more than just a genre.\n\nAt its core, metal is a movement defined by its affinity for the darker side of life. It's the \"more\" that sets it apart – more bass, more volume, more aggression, more theatrics. It's a world where musicians are not just hobbyists, but masters of their craft, with chops that shine through in their music. And, if we're being honest, metal has a long history of being fueled by the excesses of the 1970s psychedelic drug culture. The resulting records were like nothing the world had ever heard before, with artists using their experiences with psychedelics as a catalyst for creativity. Heavy metal's visceral qualities were a breath of fresh air in an industry that had grown stale, and later generations drew inspiration from the Romantic Era's darker themes. Even the Beatles, with their iconic song Helter Skelter, experimented with the heavier side of the musical spectrum, paving the way for the likes of heavy metal.",
            "Decades before the Surrealists were painting their dreamlike masterpieces, Henri Rousseau was living his own surreal dream. His 1910 painting, The Dream, is a window into not only the woman in awe of the wonders of the land she visits within her dreams, but also Rousseau's own long-held aspirations and inner turmoil as an artist. For years, he yearned for recognition, validation, and admiration from his fellow artists and art enthusiasts, yet he found himself torn between conforming to the art world's expectations and forging his own path. This internal struggle defines The Dream, a work that encapsulates Rousseau's career-long conflict: should he play it safe by mimicking the styles of others or take a chance on being unique and staying true to himself?\n\nTo truly understand the significance of The Dream, it's essential to delve into Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in the quaint town of Laval in northwest France, Henri was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer who enjoyed a comfortable middle-class lifestyle. Growing up, he didn't receive formal art training; instead, he worked as a municipal toll collector, earning him the nickname douanier, or customs inspector. The loss of his first wife, Clémence, and eight of their infant children left Rousseau heartbroken and with only one daughter, Julia, to care for. Painting became his refuge, a way to escape the darkness and find solace. Unlike his contemporaries, who idealized and romanticized the peasant class, Rousseau was a folk painter, driven by the hopes and dreams of the common man.\n\nRousseau's desire for acceptance by the art world is understandable, given his late start and lack of formal training. He began his career at a time when many other talented artists were already making a name for themselves. It wasn't until around the same time that Matisse was establishing himself as a renowned artist that Rousseau finally started to gain recognition. As art historian Jan Gordon noted in Modern French Painters, Rousseau and Matisse were polar opposites, not only in style and subject matter but also in their motivations: while Matisse sought to create something original, Rousseau aimed to produce a work so conventional that it would earn him acceptance into the Artiste Français.",
            "Philosophers have long pondered the connection between ethics and aesthetics, suggesting that truth and beauty are intertwined. In my opinion, there's a fundamental reason for this relationship. As John Keats so eloquently put it in his poem \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty— / That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" We learn a lot in life through education and experience, but our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics seems to come from a deeper place. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe, rather than prescribe. When we study morality and beauty, we're really trying to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful or why an action is moral, rather than creating a set of rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nIn essence, criticism of art or morals can never fully capture the essence of what's good or beautiful. A discussion about the value of the Mona Lisa might focus on aspects like composition, contrast, or cultural context, but these don't actually explain why it's great art. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often say something like, \"There's just something about it\" before providing a more complex analysis. I believe that art and morals can't be reduced to a description of their qualities alone. As Flannery O'Connor once said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way...you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we describe a work of literature, there's always something more that can't be put into words.\n\nSimilarly, ethics has this transcendent quality. As Wittgenstein noted, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed / Ethics is transcendental.\" I propose that it's this \"something\" – this je ne sais quoi – that's the most powerful aspect of both art and morality, and that this transcendental nature provides a connection between them.\n\nI think morality and art are closely related because we experience both at a level that's hard to explain or fully grasp, what the philosopher Kant calls the \"noumenal.\" They impact us in a way that's both profound and ineffable. This connection is even stronger when it comes to literature. As McKean argues, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about literature, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself.\" After all, living necessarily involves values, and literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.",
            "Germany, the powerhouse of today, is a nation with a rich cultural tapestry woven from diverse threads that stretch from the shadow of the Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. The same unique cultural essence resonates from the banks of the Rhine River in Cologne to the heart of the country, and all the way to the historic city of Dresden on the Elbe River. It's no surprise, then, that modern-day Germany has a complex heritage, with its roots tracing back to various tribes and sources. \n\nThe origins of the name 'Germany' are shrouded in mystery, with scholars and historians hotly debating its etymology. According to ancient Roman historian Tacitus, the name might have come from the Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, who were previously referred to as Germans before crossing the Rhine and clashing with the Gaulish forces. However, Julius Caesar, who first used the term 'Germanus' in his Gallic Wars commentary, believed it was derived from the Gauls themselves. He used this term to distinguish between the Gauls he had conquered and those he had yet to subdue. While the true origins remain unclear, some speculate that it could refer to a neighboring tribe in the Gaulish language. In his Gaulic Wars account, Caesar notes that the Germans lived beyond the Rhine, constantly at odds with the Gauls in almost daily battles. Others propose that the name 'Germany' might be linked to the spear the tribes used in warfare, known as a 'ger', or the Old Irish word 'garim', meaning 'to shout', implying the Germans were known for their loud and boisterous nature. \n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus, writing in AD 98, penned an account of the Germans' origins in his work 'De Origine et situ Germanorum'. He described the Germans as an indigenous people, untouched by external influences, who arrived by ship rather than land. He quipped that who would knowingly leave sunny Italy for Germany's harsh climate, rugged terrain, and gruff demeanor? It's unlikely the Romans would venture into Germania, at least not yet. They would send expeditions to trade and lead occasional military campaigns but ultimately return to their vast empire. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they lived on the fringes of the Roman Empire, trading their goods and skills to Roman soldiers. This complex history laid the groundwork for the modern Germany we know today.",
            "As I stood there, my gaze drifted down, my mind a complete blank.  I stared at the scene before me, my thoughts drifting in and out without leaving any lasting impression.  My mind was a smooth, efficient machine, processing the visual information in front of me without any emotional resonance.  Ideas danced across my mind, only to vanish as quickly as they appeared.\n\nI'd picked up an art instruction book, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,\" after taking advice from a fellow artist I worked with.  I'd always been fascinated by drawing, ever since I was a six-year-old, and this book promised to teach me the fundamentals, from understanding the humble pencil to the brain's process of interpreting lines.  One technique it taught was to frame a picture with a square, simplifying the complex into something easily graspable – like that bowl of fruit on the table, now just a simple, two-dimensional shape.\n\nAs I gazed at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't mentally impose that frame.  I was overwhelmed, awestruck – and all I could do was stand there, mesmerized.  Great artists like Picasso and Monet had their own signatures – blue and green, respectively – and the Italian Renaissance masters splashed across the spectrum.  If I wanted to call myself an artist, this bowl was where my story began, my Work in Brown.\n\nMy hand hesitated above the drawing tool, then moved down, my fingers making contact with the paper.  My mind's creative energy surged, as it had only a few moments before, when I'd raised the toilet plunger to tackle the clogged commode.  Water swirled, smooth and serene, but this time I was after something more tangible – a stubborn brown mass that refused to budge, stuck to the toilet like a slug on a cold surface.  I gripped the mop loosely, my feet shoulder-width apart, my tie constricting my neck.  A frown creased my face as I glared at the offending package, a messy bundle of processed food and waste, a message left for the maintenance crew at Rite Aid.  More flushes, a few more contemplative moments, and my hand reached for the toilet paper, mummifying itself into a makeshift shield.  Then, with a measured movement, I dipped my hand into the bowl, like a cook preparing a Thanksgiving turkey for the oven.",
            "Thanks to the National Institutes of Health, we've had a glimpse of the grim reality behind the wheel. Teenagers are dying in alarming numbers, and the statistics are a stark reminder of the deadly vectors that converge to create this crisis. It's a perfect storm of factors, and one of the most striking is the simple truth that the teen brain just isn't equipped to handle the perils of driving. Inexperience is another major culprit, leading not only to a higher number of fatal accidents but also a greater likelihood of vehicle rollover, speeding, and veering off the road. \n\nAdding to the problem is the notion that teens tend to fare worse when cruising with their peers – a scenario that's all too common. A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center revealed a disturbing correlation between passenger age and traffic accidents. It's a phenomenon that's as predictable as it is heartbreaking.\n\nIn response, California and other states have implemented provisional licenses to curb the carnage. These temporary permits limit driving hours and ban other minors as passengers, but I believe they're little more than a Band-Aid on a gaping wound. The real issue is that, by all statistical markers, the youngest drivers are simply not equipped to handle the risks and responsibilities that come with getting behind the wheel. Even psychologist Marvin Zuckerman thinks 18 is too young for a full driver's license, citing research that suggests a common desire among those under 19 or 20 to take risks for the thrill of it. It's a pattern that's hard to ignore, and one that makes a strong case for delaying driving until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to subside.\n\nIf we continue to issue driver's licenses to young teens, we'll see more and more deadly accidents – and the death toll will keep rising. By 2010, the Baby Boomer's children will be hitting the road in droves, and the consequences will be catastrophic. It's time for a more proactive approach, one that involves legislation to address this growing crisis.\n\nA reasonable solution would be to make driver's education classes a staple of high school curricula, but with one key caveat: no one under 18 should be allowed to get behind the wheel. A provisional permit could still be issued, but only after completing a certain number of practical driver's training hours – say, the 6 hours and 50 hours of practice already required in California. Uniform national legislation would be a powerful tool in protecting teens across the country, and it's an idea that's not exactly new. So, let's get behind it and make our roads safer for everyone.",
            "I recently spent hours browsing the Library of Congress's vast collection of early Edison films, but I zeroed in on the trick films from 1895 to 1901. There were fifteen of them, and I was determined to watch them all. These films relied heavily on creative editing to create illusions that would leave viewers mesmerized. As I delved deeper into the world of trick films, I found myself fascinated by the poetics behind most of them and the evolutionary characteristics that began to emerge in a few of the later ones. The majority of trick films from the turn of the century are static, confined to a frontal proscenium, and stick to a rigid one shot equals one film approach. They feature long and medium shots, with no camera movement to speak of. However, as we move into the early twentieth century, a few trailblazers dare to break free from these conventions by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nOne of the most striking commonalities among these trick films is the use of an interior set within a frontal proscenium frame. The camera remains stationary, never deviating from its position to follow characters or objects. This composition draws its roots from the theater and, in the case of trick films, vaudeville and magic shows. The limitations of this approach are evident in the way characters usually move side-to-side, never walking towards or away from the camera. Take, for instance, the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis, never straying from this pattern.\n\nThe use of a frontal proscenium also means that shots tend to be long and, occasionally, medium shots. Close-ups are a rarity in these trick films from the Edison catalog, a nod to the theater and vaudeville tradition where the audience sees the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in many early films, actors rarely move towards the camera, making close-ups a distant memory.\n\nMost early trick films adhere to the rule that one conceptual shot equals one film. This limits their length to around a minute or less, depending on the frame rate used. As a result, these films typically focus on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing acts, and quick switches, with little narrative or dramatic depth. However, upon closer inspection, you'll notice that what appears to be one conceptual shot can actually be several joined together to create a seamless illusion. Take, for example, The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), an early trick film that reveals a clever editing trick when you look closely.",
            "The name John Taylor of Caroline was synonymous with unwavering dedication to the principles of Republicanism. As an agriculturalist by trade and a brief stint in politics, he left an indelible mark on the discourse around personal freedom and government. His passion for an agrarian lifestyle served as the foundation for his opinions on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the judicial system. His stance was firmly rooted in his desire to preserve and promote what he deemed the most noble of all professions.\n\nTaylor believed the United States had a unique opportunity to craft an ideal system, unencumbered by traditional constraints that often hindered the development of new societies. This blank slate allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government that he passionately advocated for. He firmly believed in the inherent rights of individuals, which he saw as interconnected – when one right was compromised, the value of the others diminished. As such, these rights should be shielded from government interference. In his view, the concept of the 'state of nature' implied that those with physical strength and cunning would thrive, but in a civilized society, this shouldn't be the case.\n\nTo create an ideal society, Taylor believed a government must be designed to account for the duality of human nature – both good and evil. He rigidly adhered to a dualistic morality, arguing that as government is exercised by humans, it will inevitably reflect both virtues and vices. He defined good principles as those that protect private property, promote agriculture, and discourage the excesses of capitalism. Taylor firmly believed that a government founded on these principles would function equitably, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by avarice and self-interest. However, he noted that self-interest, though a fundamental aspect of human nature, only became problematic when it led to the creation of sub-societies that exploited others.\n\nTaylor, like many of his fellow Republicans, advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution. He envisioned a limited Federal government with only the powers explicitly stated in the Constitution, recognizing that an extensive Federal government would be expensive and prone to despotism. However, he also believed that a literal interpretation of the Constitution without considering the intent of its writers could lead to corruption. Furthermore, he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it more explicitly described the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Looking back at the data, it's clear that there was a drastic drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of our project. That was a bit disheartening, and pinpointing the cause is a challenge. It's not hard to imagine that the onset of a New England winter would lead to fewer cyclists and pedestrians commuting to campus, which could account for part of the decline. With the end of the fall semester in December comes a busy time for students and faculty, finishing up schoolwork, processing grades, and gearing up for the holiday season. It's likely that filling out the commuter log got buried under the hectic pace of the time. And then there's the month-long break that accompanies the holiday season, during which many students and faculty hardly set foot on campus. Classes resume in late January, which might explain the low number of logs for that month, too. But the low numbers in February remain a puzzle.\n\nOne possible explanation is that any project of this type tends to experience a natural ebb in enthusiasm and energy at the outset, followed by a gradual decline. To combat this trend, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week, a special campaign in March to reignite the initiative, which indeed led to an uptick in log submissions that month. This highlights one of the challenges we faced: maintaining project momentum in the face of natural fluctuations and the specific hurdles of the academic calendar.\n\nAnother hurdle we encountered is the deeply ingrained cultural preference for driving one's own car, which provides a sense of freedom, independence, and flexibility. To encourage alternative modes of commuting, we offered incentives in the form of gift certificates to local businesses like restaurants, coffee shops, and the local independent bookstore. It would have been interesting to see how larger prizes might have affected participation – think a brand-new bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have helped combat that decline in engagement we experienced. The prizes remained the same throughout the project, but if we had announced bigger and better prizes as the project progressed – say, adding a couple of bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January – it's likely that participation and engagement would have increased instead of decreased.",
            "The exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a game-changer in the world of investments. Imagine having the diversification of a mutual fund and the agility of individual stock trading all wrapped up in one convenient package. That's essentially what an ETF offers. You get the best of both worlds - the stability of a broad-based index fund and the flexibility to buy and sell as you please, even shorting or trading on margin. And the icing on the cake? ETFs come with significantly lower expense ratios compared to the average mutual fund.\n\nOf course, there are some downsides to consider. Trading ETFs involves paying a commission, just like you would with individual stocks. But the benefits far outweigh the costs. With a staggering array of funds to choose from, you can pick and choose the ones that fit your investment goals and risk tolerance. So, what's the best way to evaluate an ETF? A savvy investor would do well to dig deeper and assess whether the touted benefits, like diversification, really deliver. For the sake of this exercise, we'll be taking a closer look at the ETF IHF and its top 10 holdings to see whether owning a single ETF can match the benefits of a diversified portfolio of individual stocks.\n\nTo keep things manageable, we're focusing on the top 10 holdings, which account for a whopping 63.58% of the ETF's assets. Here they are, along with their respective percentages. We'll use these holdings to estimate how well they represent the ETF as a whole. By normalizing their assets to 100%, we can calculate their individual contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return, as if the portfolio consisted solely of these 10 stocks in the same proportions as the ETF.\n\nThe chart reveals an interesting finding: a portfolio consisting only of the top 10 holdings would yield a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, a 16% boost in returns. Furthermore, the Beta of this portfolio is 0.12 lower than the ETF's. This suggests that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings might offer higher returns with lower risk. But are these findings statistically significant? To find out, we'll examine the standard deviation of each of these top 10 stocks, normalized to 100%, and compare them to the ETF's accumulated standard deviation.",
            "In the realm of poetry, Edgar Allan Poe's \"Dream-Land\" stands out as one of his masterpieces. The term \"Thulé\" pops up twice in this poem, lines 6 and 56, a nod to the ancient world that Poe was deeply familiar with. In fact, \"Thulé\" has its roots in Virgil's time, referring to an island north of Britain that the Greeks believed marked the edge of the known world. While Virgil did indeed use the term, there's another source that deserves credit - Poe's fascination with German literature, particularly the works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.\n\nThis tidbit is significant because it reveals Poe's admiration for Goethe's writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" points out the striking similarities between their poems, suggesting that Poe was, in fact, inspired by Goethe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature notes that Goethe was a celebrated poet, best known for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" which was published in two parts - the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe's passing. Within \"Faust's\" second part lies a haunting poem called \"The King of Thulé,\" which tells the story of a king whose wife dies, leaving him heartbroken and lost in grief. He spends his days drinking and crying, eventually giving up his kingdom and life, casting his belongings into the ocean. The king's tale bears an uncanny resemblance to the protagonist in \"Dream-Land,\" who finds himself lost in a dark, lonely world, haunted by memories of loved ones and a world devoid of color.\n\nPoe references Thule twice in his writings, using the phrase \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and \"Dream-Land\" as bookends. These two poems can be seen as companion pieces, with \"The King of Thulé\" serving as a precursor to \"Dream-Land.\" In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a desolate landscape, where shadows loom large and color is absent, a world that eerily mirrors Goethe's \"The King of Thulé,\" where the king's loss of his wife has left him a hollow shell of his former self. Given Poe's admiration for Alfred Tennyson, it's likely that he was familiar with Goethe's work through various reproductions and adaptations that were circulating after the original publication.",
            "In the Golden State of California, if a shopper gets hurt after slipping on an applesauce spill at the grocery store and then sues the store for punitive damages, can they succeed if they prove the store manager acted with malice? The manager, Paul Martin, was told about the spill twice - once by Rich Wayne at 5:00 pm and again by Mary J. Haddigan at 5:15 pm - but chose to keep eating dinner instead of having it cleaned up by 5:30 pm. So, did Martin show a \"willful and conscious disregard\" for the potential harm caused by the spill? To get punitive damages, the shopper, Jennifer Palmer, will need to show that Martin knew the spill could cause harm because multiple customers had fallen in the same spot before her accident. Palmer may argue that Martin was deliberately ignoring the safety of his customers by not cleaning up the spill, especially considering six slip-and-fall incidents happened at D&D Markets in 2009. While this argument might not be a slam dunk, it's still a reasonable claim given the evidence. \n\nLet's take a closer look at what happened. On October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne told Martin about the applesauce spill, and Martin basically said he was too busy eating dinner to care. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also informed Martin about the spill, and he responded with the same attitude. It's no coincidence that Palmer slipped and fell on the spill at 5:30 pm, and it's no surprise that she's now suing D&D Markets for compensation and punitive damages. The question is whether Palmer has a strong enough case to win punitive damages. In California, a person can receive punitive damages if the other party acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" The law defines malice as either intending to cause harm or being downright despicable and recklessly disregarding the rights or safety of others. \n\nSo, will the court dismiss Palmer's case or let it move forward? To determine this, we need to look at whether Martin's actions were malicious. According to the law, conduct is malicious if it's a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights when the defendant knows the probable harm of their actions and chooses to ignore it. In this case, Martin was aware of the potential danger of the spill because several customers had already fallen in the same area, and he still chose to do nothing. This is why Palmer's lawyer will likely argue that Martin's actions were despicable and warrant punitive damages.",
            "Almost four years ago, I took a course in Islam at CBC, where one of the most heated debates in class centered around whether Islam is a hostile religion. This question seems even more pertinent today than ever before. Looking back on the years since 9/11, I've noticed that mass media has swung from a hostile view of Islam to an extreme level of tolerance in America. We've come a long way, and it's hard to imagine that in 2001, we wouldn't have seen a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, who has an openly acknowledged Muslim background in his family.\n\nThe Biography of the Prophet has been a fascinating study for me, as it reveals a Muhammad that contradicts what I previously thought. What I knew of Muhammad's history suggested he was a forceful leader who forced conversions to Islam, conquering tribes and imposing his faith on them. However, the biography portrays Muhammad as a humble, misunderstood, and even self-effacing martyr, who attracted followers one by one through the truth of his teachings.\n\nSome striking similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the miracles attributed to Muhammad have also caught my attention. One such example is when Muhammad multiplied mutton and milk to feed forty men, much like the miracle stories associated with Jesus. I suspect that the writers aimed to present Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove himself, but lived in truth and performed miracles. This approach, in my view, diminishes the significance of Jesus' life and miracles, much like taking credit for someone else's achievements.\n\nFurthermore, the biography seems to be driven by an agenda to provide evidence of witness and spontaneous conversions to Islam, with many stories presented through third-party accounts. This makes me skeptical, as it diminishes the authenticity of the stories and implies a level of fabrication. It's as if they're trying to create a narrative that undermines the integrity of the original accounts.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this work is the attempt to portray Muhammad as a godly figure, humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. History, however, suggests that Muhammad's rise to power was far from gentle, and I wonder if today's Muslims are aware of the true complexities behind their prophet's story.",
            "The teachings of Jesus and the core beliefs he held during his life were quickly lost in the sands of time as Christianity evolved after his passing. When we view this history from a broad perspective, we notice a trend of Christianity drifting further and further away from its roots. Today, we're witnessing a growing awareness and an unprecedented shift towards progress. While traditionalists cling to the status quo and resist any departure from established dogma, this segment of the population may not hold enough sway to shape the entire narrative. As time progresses, a growing awareness of Christian history will emerge, and a yearning will develop to distinguish the doctrines that have been added to Christianity over the centuries from the original intent of the faith's namesake. It may take decades or even centuries, but the inevitable outcome will be a reversal of the trend in Christian history. The movement will slowly but surely peel back the layers of doctrine, reversing the clock as it were, until only the fundamental principles introduced by Jesus on behalf of God remain. When this shift sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing the masses, the church as an institution will continue to thrive, but its teachings will become more uniform and less diverse. Regions, denominations, and divisions will begin to resemble each other more closely, rather than showcasing their differences. History is replete with examples of such reversions – consider how the Roman Empire once persecuted Christians, only to later become a bastion of Christianity, or how the United States transitioned from slavery to African-American leadership. The great reversion that's on the horizon will play out in the realm of the Christian faith, as we seek to return to the source and, in the process, shed our diversity. A crucial aspect of this journey will be reinterpreting Jesus' words as metaphors rather than literal statements. So, what's changed since Jesus' time?\n\nLooking back through the mists of history, we find that the only existing faith was Judaism, the theological foundation of the Christian religion. By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were established at the core of this faith. However, the Jewish population was not a monolith; they divided into the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common people, each with their own distinct perspectives.",
            "The Jungle is a thought-provoking novel that forces us to confront the harsh realities of human nature. Beneath the surface, we're all driven by our own self-interest, prioritizing our own desires above the needs of others. This self-centeredness is starkly evident in the novel's portrayal of the factory owners and managers, who are consumed by their quest for wealth and power. Their relentless pursuit of growth and expansion knows no bounds, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. The factory's imposing silhouette against the sky, with its towering chimneys spewing forth smoke and pollution, serves as a powerful metaphor for the devastating impact of their actions.\n\nAccording to Upton Sinclair's masterful depiction, the owners' disregard for the well-being of their employees is matched only by their disdain for the environment. The pollution and filth that pervade Packingtown are a testament to their callous disregard for the consequences of their actions. The workers, meanwhile, are nothing more than pawns in the owners' game of profit and greed, forced to toil in dehumanizing conditions with little regard for their safety or dignity.\n\nThe owners' treatment of their employees is a stark reminder of the exploitation that exists in the world. They'll stop at nothing to maximize profits, even if it means sacrificing the livelihoods of their workers. The speed and intensity of the production line, combined with the ever-present threat of layoffs and unemployment, creates a culture of fear and desperation. With little to no protection from the law, workers are forced to endure the harshest conditions, their lives reduced to a mere commodity to be exploited.\n\nWhile the novel doesn't explicitly state it, the workers in Packingtown are little more than modern-day slaves, their lives controlled by the whims of their oppressors. The lack of support systems, combined with the corrupting influence of unions that prey on the vulnerable, only serves to perpetuate the cycle of exploitation. The consequences of this system are dire, with immorality and despair becoming nearly inevitable outcomes for those trapped within its grasp.",
            "When authors aim to evoke a particular feeling or attitude in their readers, they often employ various techniques to achieve this goal. Some methods prove more effective than others, and F. Scott Fitzgerald skillfully employs a range of these techniques in his novel, The Great Gatsby. To create a specific ambiance around a subject, Fitzgerald pairs seemingly incongruous adjectives and nouns, while also attributing meaning to symbols and using them for the same purpose. He takes this latter approach with numerous colors, including gold, green, white, and red, weaving intricate meanings for these hues throughout the novel. \n\nIn The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald masterfully builds up the significance of colors, particularly white and red, then harnesses this meaning to elicit a particular emotional response in readers when applied to significant objects. When it comes to white/gray, Fitzgerald creates a sense of uniformity, with white representing a touch of elegance and refinement, while gray signifies age and faded grandeur. He sets the stage for this interpretation from the novel's outset, frequently using both colors in various contexts. For example, Daisy and Jordan are frequently \"in white,\" and everyone, including Nick, wears white attire at Gatsby's party - Tom dons a \"white shirt,\" and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white.\" Notably, the only time people are not dressed in white is when Nick is describing the impressions he formed of Gatsby's party, where the atmosphere is dominated by \"primary colors.\" Fitzgerald further solidifies the meaning of these colors by applying them to mundane, inconsequential subjects: as Nick navigates his daily routine, he walks through \"the white chasms of lower New York,\" and the names on his schedule become \"gray names.\" He also describes ordinary people or places as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy share a \"white girlhood,\" the valley of ashes is characterized by \"gray cars and gray land,\" and the dog-seller is a \"gray old man.\" \n\nAfter establishing the meaning of white/gray, Fitzgerald uses these colors to convey a sense of unimportance or uniformity to certain subjects, beginning with Daisy. After an extended period of relative absence, Fitzgerald reintroduces white as a descriptor for Daisy, depicting her dressed in \"a little white roadster,\" thereby reducing her in the reader's eyes from a fully fleshed-out character to a mere uniform ideal, something Gatsby covets and yearns for. This technique is also employed around Daisy, reinforcing the notion that she is a uniform addition, as seen in the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" and her appearance in a \"white\" dress prior to Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "The sun-kissed county of San Diego is a haven for agricultural productivity, with its idyllic climate yielding a bountiful harvest of delicious crops. Tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, and an array of herbs, tree fruits, and berries thrive in this Mediterranean haven. The demand for organic community-supported agriculture is also on the rise in the area, with numerous organizations experiencing lengthy waiting lists for their fresh produce. Locals can also indulge in organic eggs, milk, and honey, and many farms offer tours, allowing visitors to connect with nature and appreciate the beauty of the land.\n\nHowever, the benefits of organic farming come at a cost. The absence of chemicals in the soil and water leads to greater biodiversity in the area, but it also demands more labor and management to control pests and weeds, as well as to maintain soil fertility. Compared to conventional farming methods, organic farming often incurs higher losses and lacks the efficiency of larger operations. Moreover, small-scale organic farming requires more manual effort to implement beneficial practices like cover cropping, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and managing plant growth to create specific conditions for wildlife. As a result, landowners in this scenario may seek financial assistance or expert guidance to maximize their profits while preserving the land's ecological integrity.\n\nThe chosen property is a 160-acre tract of land adjacent to the charming town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California. This diverse landscape comprises chaparral, non-native grasslands, and oak woodlands, situated next to the Cleveland National Forest. The property falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which currently considers over a hundred species of flora and fauna, many of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the mountain yellow-legged frog.\n\nThis land has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries and later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 19th century. The property was originally part of a homestead patent, likely used for grazing and wood production over the years. To explore the possibilities for a small farmer in this area, I researched government programs and chose a model from a nearby organic farm in the same region.",
            "The intricate dance of culture plays a profound role in the delicate art of negotiation. But what exactly is culture? It's not a straightforward concept, as it's defined by both what it is and what it signifies. Culture is multifaceted, diverse, and far from uniform. Making broad statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" does more harm than good, oversimplifying the complexities of a culture. A more constructive approach is to grasp the significance of a culture to the negotiation at hand and how its values will influence the conversation. When interacting with a foreign culture, we inevitably compare it to our own, and a deeper understanding can be gained by studying its history, biases, and traditions.\n\nRather than judging or trying to change a culture, it's essential to accept it for what it is, working within its boundaries, especially during negotiations. This is particularly crucial when you find yourself in a weaker bargaining position. Similarly, when negotiating in unfamiliar territory, respecting local customs and traditions can help break down cultural barriers and facilitate progress.\n\nIt's also essential to recognize that culture doesn't solely exist within national or international contexts. Corporate cultures within a single nation can be vastly different, shaped by factors such as work hours, communication styles, and hiring practices. Take the varying corporate cultures within the United States, for example, which can differ significantly from company to company and even within the same company from one region to another. This diversity of thought within a societal culture is a reflection of the complex, multifaceted nature of human experience.\n\nUnderstanding values is equally crucial, as they reveal the underlying motivations and priorities of a culture. In cultures where saving face or communal harmony are valued, a negotiator is unlikely to publicly embarrass their company or superior to achieve success. Conversely, in cultures that prioritize a hard-driven bargain, negotiators may not be inclined to settle quickly. By considering these generalities before the negotiation, you'll be better equipped to navigate the complexities of cross-cultural communication. However, don't underestimate the importance of getting to know your opponent on a personal level – it's a key factor in effective negotiation.",
            "The phrase \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God'\" first appears in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and serves as the starting point for St. Anselm's argument on the existence of God. This notion also resonates with Thomas Aquinas, another influential thinker we'll be exploring. Since both authors aim to prove the same concept, we'll begin by assuming they're correct in their belief in a God-like entity, specifically the God of the Bible. Examining alternative, non-Biblical concepts of God would skew our comparison, as their arguments are fundamentally in defense of this particular notion of divinity. So, let's dive into their arguments, keeping in mind that each makes some compelling points, yet neither provides a comprehensive foundation for believing in God.\n\nTo illustrate this, let's start by dissecting St. Anselm's argument. Anselm's reasoning is centered around gaining understanding through faith, exploring the depths of one's own mind to find proof of God. He proposes that because God exists within our understanding, we can't conceive of his nonexistence. In essence, Anselm suggests that the proof for God lies within the confines of our own minds, and that we don't need external evidence to confirm his existence. This idea relies on the concept of faith, which, within Christian texts, refers to accepting truths without empirical proof. This line of thinking often raises eyebrows, as it seems to defy the need for concrete evidence.\n\nIn stark contrast, Thomas Aquinas takes a more cerebral approach. He argues that the existence of God can be proven solely through reason and empirical evidence, eliminating the need for faith altogether. This perspective would be particularly valuable in evangelism, a vital aspect of Christianity, as it would allow for the recruitment of new followers without relying on their willingness to accept the unproven. Instead, logic would be the driving force behind their conversion. Aquinas presents five logical arguments in support of God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each showcases the logical necessity for God's existence, demonstrating that we can deduce the existence of the missing piece (God) even when it's not directly visible, much like completing a puzzle.",
            "About 2500 years ago, in ancient times, a prince was born who would eventually be known as the Buddha. Throughout his life, he rejected worldly pursuits, achieved enlightenment, and his teachings gave rise to Buddhism. However, the faith has undergone significant changes over the centuries. This transformation is apparent in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed, a tradition that was never explicitly taught by the Buddha himself. These changes span from superficial customs to the very core of the faith, encompassing both the monastic and lay perspectives. The Theravada Buddhist community has had to adapt its core principles over time due to external and internal influences, both benevolent and malevolent.\n\nIn this discussion, certain terms will be used extensively. 'Internal force' refers to any change originating within the Buddhist community, while 'external force' denotes any influence from non-Buddhists. A 'hostile force' is any influence that seeks to harm or damage the Buddhist community, often stemming from a negative perception of Buddhism. Conversely, a 'benign force' does not intend to harm or help the community, though its outcomes may be unintentionally detrimental or beneficial.\n\nLet's delve into the fundamental principles of Theravada Buddhism, which form the bedrock of the faith. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is comprised of the Tripitaka, consisting of the Sutta Pitaka, Vinaya Pitaka, and Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Sutta Pitaka houses the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the monastic disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka deals with the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. These concepts include Anatta (no fixed self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these ideas is crucial to breaking free from Sansara, the cycle of birth and death, and eventually, attaining enlightenment, thereby ending lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka outlines rules for laymen, including the five precepts (non-harming, truthfulness, non-stealing, chastity, and abstinence from intoxicants), while monks adhere to numerous additional rules. The four noble truths, a fundamental Buddhist concept, state that life is marked by Dukkha, attachment causes suffering, and that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico - a tale of a 57-year rivalry that spanned the years from 1836 to 1893. It's a story of clashes, compromises, and a long, winding road to eventual understanding. The rivalry, which reached its peak in the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, was a defining moment in the history of both nations. The war saw the United States emerge victorious, claiming Texas and the American Southwest as its own. However, it wasn't the only confrontation between the two countries. There were many skirmishes, disputes, and standoffs that continued to simmer until just before the outbreak of World War I.\n\nAt the heart of the rivalry were fundamental disagreements over issues like faith, culture, and tradition. The two nations also had competing material interests, which often led to confrontations. This pattern is all too familiar in the world of international relations, where nations sharing a border often find themselves at odds over competing interests. The United States and Mexico are just one example of many long-standing rivalries that have shaped the complex web of relationships between nations.\n\nHistorians like David M. Pletcher have noted that the United States has had its fair share of diplomatic headaches over the years, particularly with Mexico and Cuba. These two countries, due to their proximity to the United States, have often found themselves at odds with American interests. In contrast, many other Latin American nations have enjoyed relatively smooth relations with the United States.\n\nReligious differences were another point of contention between the United States and Mexico. This was a trend that echoed throughout history, as nations have often been driven apart by fundamental disagreements over faith and governance. Sally Frahm observed that Americans have historically been wary of Catholicism and monarchy, just as they were opposed to fascism and communism in the 20th century. This ideological divide was deeply rooted in the distrust that existed between the English and Spanish empires, which in turn had a lasting impact on the relationship between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts documented 17 significant disputes between Mexico and the United States during this 57-year period, with most of them centering on territorial issues, border raids, and frontier problems. The issue of bandits and outlaws crossing the border was a recurring problem that only began to subside when both countries fortified their borders. As Schmitt pointed out, the rivalry between the two nations began to dissipate as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the United States, and American interests shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico.",
            "It's hard to believe it's been fifteen years since my life was turned upside down by a mysterious illness that I'd never even heard of. At the time, I was living my dream as a nurse, a career I'd chosen to escape the uncertainty of my own childhood. The mantra I'd heard over and over as I grew up was, \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\" So, I put my aspirations of becoming a scientist or journalist on the backburner and pursued nursing instead.\n\nFast forward to my 46th birthday, and I was faced with a harsh reality: I was struggling to make ends meet, with no savings to speak of, and unable to work due to my illness. Fifteen years later, I'm still living on Social Security Disability, and I've lost everything that was once mine. Every day is a grueling battle to maintain my security, safety, and self-respect. Yet, amidst the chaos, I've come to realize one invaluable truth: when disaster strikes, we all need a little help from our friends and family, no matter how strong we think we are. And trust me, when real disaster hits, strength is the last thing you feel like you possess.\n\nMy point is that life is unpredictable, and emergencies can lurk around every corner, big or small. No matter how well-prepared we think we are, some challenges are simply too big to tackle alone.\n\nI agree that we should be cautious about relying too heavily on government support, but I firmly believe that Americans would be better off learning to trust and help one another rather than turning to individualism as a solution. The idea of rugged individualism that our country was built on is a myth; it was actually the compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources of our forefathers that carried them through tough times. The pioneers who crossed the country in wagon trains didn't make it on their own; they had each other.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared – I've got my disaster kit and emergency supplies ready. I've got flashlights, first aid supplies, and a stash of canned goods, just in case. But while it's essential to be prepared, it's equally important to build a community that looks out for one another. Get to know your neighbors, and who knows, you might just find a lifeline when you need it most.",
            "Evolution's intricate dance - what drives it forward? Are there unseen forces that shape the course of change in the natural world? It's a question that has puzzled scientists for centuries, from D'Arcy Thompson's groundbreaking statements in 1917 to the present day. Despite the advances in mathematical modeling, the complexity of organic forms remains a mystery waiting to be unraveled. Recent studies, however, have applied mathematical modeling to the intricate processes of mollusk skeletogenesis, both during development and evolution (Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research delves into how mathematically modeling ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, combined with experimental studies, can shed light on the mechanisms behind evolutionary-developmental change.\n\nWe used high-tech X-ray images of Prunum species to quantify key parameters that can be used to model hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. These parameters were then fed into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995) to create a virtual framework for understanding the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. By combining these results with experimental and observational studies, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying forces that shape macroevolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a dynamic, three-dimensional structure that grows and changes over time, like a spiral that unwinds through 360 degrees of space. Each coil is called a whorl, which spirals around an imaginary central axis, or columella, that runs through the shell's central column. The rate at which whorls expand can vary, and the continuous lines separating each whorl are called sutures. In most shells, the last whorl, or body whorl, is the largest. The spire is the collective whorls excluding the last one, while the apex is the spire's tip and the base is the opposite end. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from different angles - apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural - with the \"classic\" view being the apertural perspective, where the aperture faces the viewer and the apex points upwards.\n\nTo count whorls, start by viewing the shell from the apical angle and mark where the first suture begins. Draw a line dividing the shell in two, then count the whorls from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures that traverse time and space as the animal builds its shell. By tracking the center of each whorl's aperture and its horizontal and vertical radius, we can map the shell's path through space and time. This trajectory can be represented graphically and mathematically, allowing us to manipulate the parameters and explore the mollusk's skeletogenesis in greater detail.",
            "We've all been watching Indonesia struggle to make headway in reducing neonatal and infant mortality rates over the past decade. Despite making strides in meeting some of the Millennium Development Goals, such as water and sanitation targets, the country has been woefully slow to improve child and maternal health. This plateau highlights the need to strengthen the overall health system rather than pinning our hopes on targeted programmatic interventions.\n\nThe statistics are telling. While 72% of births in Indonesia now involve a skilled health worker, this figure is somewhat misleading because it includes traditional workers like midwives who aren't equipped to handle complications. The consequence is a high number of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage. Moreover, the rate of diarrheal cases in children under five treated by a health professional has been on the decline. Unfortunately, data on postnatal care is incomplete, and what we do have suggests that this area is a major concern, with low rates across the country.\n\nCesarian-section rates are still disconcertingly low at 4% nationwide, but the disparity between urban and rural areas is even more striking. While 7% of urban births involve a C-section, this rate drops to an alarming 2% in rural areas. This stark contrast highlights the issue of unequal access to healthcare services, with urban areas reaping the lion's share of the benefits. Another pressing concern is vertical equity: there's a staggering 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles. This means the poor are struggling to access healthcare services, largely due to the financial burden of out-of-pocket costs.\n\nSo, what's the way forward? The fundamental question is how to effectively address the glaring lack of services. Should Indonesia focus on targeted programmatic approaches or strengthen the overall health system? While program-specific solutions may seem attractive, yielding faster results and more manageable objectives, they have their drawbacks. Investing heavily in one area can divert resources from other essential areas, drawing human resources towards the most funded sectors. Moreover, running multiple parallel programs can lead to duplication of services, uncoordinated between programs, resulting in increased paperwork and administrative burdens.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their meticulous attention to detail and their focus on the lives of the aristocracy of the time period. However, two works that deviate from this norm are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. Both novels incorporate elements of mystery and a touch of the bizarre, characteristics that were not typical of novels from the era. These unconventional features serve to strengthen the characters within each novel, offering valuable insights into their motivations and emotions.\n\nAs the characters navigated the chaotic world around them, their minds were flooded with a multitude of bewildering ideas. The lines between reality and fantasy began to blur, and it seemed as though they were trapped in a never-ending cycle of confusion. In Oliver Twist, for instance, the protagonist's inner turmoil is revealed through his dreamlike states and hallucinations. These strange visions offer a glimpse into Oliver's inner world, exposing his deepest fears and pains. The vivid description of the shooting in chapter 28 is a prime example of this. Oliver's reliving of the traumatic event is a stark reminder of the lack of control he had over his circumstances, and the devastating impact it had on his health.\n\nThe passage is a poignant portrayal of Oliver's emotional state, as he struggles to come to terms with the dire reality of his situation. His hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit serve as a constant reminder of the pain and fear that he endured. The \"unseen hand\" that swept him away is a powerful symbol of the overwhelming forces that controlled his life, leaving him feeling powerless and defeated. The passage implies that Oliver's experiences have broken him, rendering him incapable of taking control of his own life, even in the face of danger.\n\nIn a similar vein, the novel Wuthering Heights employs dreamlike sequences to reveal the inner workings of its characters' minds. The passage from Wuthering Heights describes a sense of time and space that is distorted and disjointed, reflecting the characters' emotional states. The day and night seem to blend together, creating a sense of timelessness and desperation. This portrayal of the characters' inner world serves to underscore their emotional turmoil and the sense of being trapped in a world beyond their control.",
            "A couple of years ago, I had the chance to work with elementary school students in an after-school program, where I tried to help them with their academic struggles, particularly in English and reading. However, I was approached by one of the instructors to assist a young boy named Adrian, who was in third or fourth grade. What struck me was that his reading difficulties didn't seem to follow the usual pattern. Some letters he could pronounce flawlessly, while others left him completely stumped. It was baffling, especially since he spoke perfect English. I had a hunch that his linguistic background might be the key, and I was right. His mother, who walked in on me while babysitting, only spoke Spanish, and I realized that Adrian's issue wasn't reading per se, but rather not knowing the English alphabet. This epiphany revealed to me how easily language barriers can masquerade as reading difficulties. I'm not sure how much it helped Adrian, but I hope he's made progress since then.\n\nI share this story to highlight the complexities of language barriers in schools, particularly in California, and to show that the issue isn't always as straightforward as we think. Even for children who speak perfect English, reading can still be a significant hurdle. It's clear that this problem exists, so what can we do about it? In Adrian's case, the solution was simple: targeted tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for children who barely speak English, the solution is far more intricate. There is no single answer. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, and ESL classes, each by itself, won't solve this problem. The key lies in combining these approaches.\n\nThe dual language system is an excellent concept that can benefit all children, not just those whose first language is Spanish. Research has shown that \"children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.\" Many people fear that such programs will waste resources and only benefit a minority of students, but this is a misconception. If implemented as the standard, rather than an exception, all children would benefit from these programs. So, how can we make this happen? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? That would be unrealistic and impractical. Instead, we can have bilingual aids, tutors, or support staff to help.",
            "We're often fed the notion that there's something greater than us, something we can't fully grasp since childhood. Some of us head to Sunday school, others to the temple, while many more turn inward in search of answers. Many of us simply accept the faiths passed down by our parents, but some of us reject them outright, convinced that there's nothing beyond our own understanding. We may adopt one value system only to later replace it with another. Ultimately, our journey is about defining ourselves through our unique perspectives on spirituality, seeking a guiding light in the darkness to lead us from the shadows into the light.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\nI remember a conversation with my dad, sitting on our porch as the rain poured down around us. We sat amidst the sound of raindrops pounding on the tin roof, surrounded by the dying plants along the edge of the porch. My dad's eyes were lost in thought, gazing out into the rain with a mix of introspection and reminiscence. He'd grown thinner and frailer over the past few months, his hair thinned out, and his clothes hung loosely on his frame. I sensed a deep sadness, a sense of unease, and a reluctance to confront the reality of his impending loss. I hugged him, sat back down, and joined him in staring out into the rain-soaked evening.\n\nMy dad passed away just five days after my twenty-second birthday in December. The chemo and radiation had prolonged his life by a few months, but it only prolonged his suffering. I couldn't help but wonder, what kind of higher power would do this? As I lay alone in the dark that night, I didn't say any prayers. If there was a God, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI chose not to watch my dad's final days. I couldn't bear to witness the life that created me slipping away. I wanted to remember my dad as he lived, not as he died. I knew him better than anyone else did, and I was certain he wouldn't have wanted me to be there for his passing. I curled up in a ball in bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nBut the phone never rang.",
            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" is a paradox in and of itself, as literary critic Ian Watt so aptly described it as an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New.'\" [The Rise of the Gothic Novel] The Gothic mode has been subject to a range of reactions, from scathing criticism to fervent praise, with some accusing it of lacking depth and others lauding its ability to evoke a sense of the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke).  Interestingly, the genre's birthplace can be attributed to Horace Walpole's 18th-century masterpiece, The Castle of Otranto, which successfully blended elements of both \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances to create a new literary form.  Walpole cleverly combined \"old\" theatrical elements with the \"new\" narrative style of modern novels to craft a story he dubbed \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre draws heavily from medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions, often incorporating them in a way that adds to its mystique. At the time of The Castle of Otranto's publication, the term \"gothic\" was already being used to describe various cultures, styles, and eras, often with a hint of nostalgia or even disdain for what was perceived as outdated or unsophisticated in the face of modern advancements. The union of the theatrical \"Gothic\" with the novel's innovative format, which allowed readers a more intimate glimpse into the characters' psychology, enabled the Gothic genre to endure for centuries, becoming both nostalgic and new to readers from different eras.\n\nOne of the most enduring Gothic ideas is the concept of Chivalry, which has its roots in medieval times. The original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto, explores this idea, adapting and transmuting it to create a sense of an idealized past. Chivalry, with its associations of bravery, honor, and competence, was crucial to Gothic writers like Walpole, who saw it as a lost ideal in their own time. Through the use of chivalric concepts and mannerisms, the \"gothic past\" becomes romanticized and idealized, hinting at the future evolution of Gothic into Romantic literature. As Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto during a tumultuous period in history, he may have believed that the supposed morality and goodness of the Gothic era had been lost in modern society. This sentiment is evident in the character of Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits, including being a prince, having suffered tragedy, and being described in a way that exaggerates traditional chivalric images. This character serves as a precursor to the Gothic trope of excess, which would become a hallmark of the genre (66).",
            "The concept of supply chain management has been evolving rapidly over the years, and I've seen firsthand the transformation of the way companies manage their goods movement from raw materials to the final customer. The term 'supply chain management' was coined in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant who recognized the importance of streamlining the process to meet customer demands efficiently. The entire supply chain process involves planning, implementing, and controlling various stages to ensure customer satisfaction. At its core, supply chain management is about orchestrating the six key elements: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information to provide exceptional customer service.\n\nProduction is where it all begins. It's the foundation upon which the entire supply chain is built. This stage involves outlining the when, why, where, and how of production, which requires managers to stay attuned to customer needs. By analyzing market trends, managers can gauge what customers are demanding and decide what products to produce, in what quantities, and where to produce them to meet customer expectations. The location for production is critical, as it affects volume and quality, so managers must weigh these factors carefully.\n\nOnce production is underway, managers focus on scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. Every detail is crucial, as any misstep can lead to costly delays and inefficiencies down the line. I've seen this firsthand in my retail days at places like Wal-Mart and Target, where even the smallest processes – from employee uniforms to receiving shipments – are meticulously planned and executed to ensure a seamless customer experience.\n\nThe next key element is supply, which involves strategic decisions about core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. Companies often have multiple divisions for a single product, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers must decide which division is best suited for each process and may choose to outsource work to other companies to boost velocity – the ability to deliver high-quality products while keeping costs low. By outsourcing, companies can tap into new capabilities and expertise, allowing them to stay competitive in the market.",
            "I was staring at a haunting message scrawled on a cardboard sign held aloft by Ellen Page, the talented actress from Juno. \"Hitler is alive in Burma,\" it read, the words etched with a Sharpie in bold, stark letters. I couldn't help but wonder about the tumultuous history of Burma, now known as Myanmar, a Southeast Asian nation ruled by a ruthless military junta that seized power in 1962 through a sudden coup. In 2007, a wave of protests erupted, led by courageous Burmese monks clad in their distinctive saffron robes. Dubbed the \"Saffron Revolution,\" these gatherings marked a rare moment of public defiance in a decade of silence. However, the government's initial hesitation to crack down was short-lived, and soon the violence escalated into a brutal conflict between the monks and the military, with troops invading and ransacking monasteries across the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned, with a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, tragically killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for witnessing a street protest. Estimates of the death toll varied, with some reports claiming as few as 13 fatalities, while Colonel Hla Win, a former army officer, whispered a chilling truth: \"Many more people have been killed in recent days than you've been told. There are thousands of bodies to count.\"\n\nThis is a story as old as civilization itself. Throughout history, governments have sought to suppress dissent and maintain complete control over their citizens. Ancient Roman emperors declared themselves divine rulers, while Japanese emperors were believed to be gods, sent to guide their people to prosperity – or so they claimed. Our own President George W. Bush allegedly held weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of the self-proclaimed Stupid People Worldwide, a group that seemed to be an offshoot of the Republican Party.\n\nThere have been countless examples of these power-hungry tactics. The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where students, intellectuals, and labor activists dared to challenge the Chinese government, resulted in a mysterious death toll that ranged from 200 to a staggering 3,000. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, backed by the Rwandan government, systematically slaughtered Tutsis and political moderates, was another egregious example. And then, of course, there's the infamous Holocaust, where Hitler's 'Third Reich' machinery rounded up and killed millions of Jews.",
            "The impact of Duke Ellington's legacy in jazz is largely due to his remarkable longevity and, by extension, his incredible ability to push the boundaries of his orchestra through his creative vision. While his piano playing is often understated in many of his compositions, as a composer Ellington excelled in crafting rich and complex pieces that showcased the unique talents of each band member. He skillfully designed the framework for soloists to improvise freely, as well as writing tightly orchestrated sections that highlighted the distinctive style of individual musicians, all while maintaining a cohesive tone for the entire orchestra. Through this approach, Ellington managed to create some of the most groundbreaking and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative use of voice as a jazz instrument, as seen in Creole Love Call, an early example of using voice to add texture and depth without the constraints of lyrics. This piece demonstrates Ellington's ability to complement the style of his soloists, a trait evident throughout his career. The 12-bar blues piece features six distinct choruses, including a call and response between voice and reeds, a muted trumpet solo, a sweeping clarinet solo, a full-band echo of the first chorus, a climactic reed-driven chorus, and a final chorus with a return to the call and response structure, where the voice takes on the sound of the \"growl\" technique. A brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant trombone ending rounds out the piece.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add a dimension of tone color is a stylistic trait that permeates his work. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year after Creole Love Call, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color, creating a rich and complementary sound through a call and response phrase between Bubber Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing. This technique is further explored in It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), where Ellington uses Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone. These examples showcase Ellington's mastery of creating innovative and harmonious sounds that bring out the best in his musicians.",
            "It's a nagging feeling that's been haunting her since she was 14. A yearning that refused to be satiated, growing stronger with each passing year. At 17, it was still there, gnawing at her insides. She'd initially thought it was a desire for something, but as the years went by, she realized it was actually a longing for someone. However, the people who had caught her attention just didn't seem to fit the bill. She found herself questioning this peculiar affliction, trying to pinpoint its source, but nothing seemed to stick. The years of contemplation had yielded a multitude of theories, yet none of them felt quite right.\n\nThose were usually the days when life was idyllic at home. Her parents were a tranquil couple who rarely argued with each other, and when they did, it was usually over her desire for independence and free-spirited nature. She, the free-spirited daughter of calm parents, brought a whirlwind of energy to the household. It was a dynamic that worked surprisingly well, and her likability made it easy for people to warm up to her.\n\nBut today was a different story. As she wandered through the house, searching for inspiration, the serene atmosphere was shattered by a blood-curdling scream from the kitchen. Her mother's voice, a melodious sound, was now laced with distress. Panic set in as she rushed to the kitchen, her mind racing with worst-case scenarios. \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" she exclaimed, dashing into the room. Her mother was on the ground, writhing in agony, her words barely above a whisper. \"Ow...sweetie, I...need you to take me to...the hospital.\" The desperation in her voice was palpable, and her daughter sprang into action. \"Okay, Mom, where can I pick you up?\" she asked, trying to keep her cool. Her mother's directions were fragmented, but her daughter was grateful for the classes that had honed her physical strength. She carefully lifted her mother and placed her in the car, driving her to the hospital with a sense of purpose.\n\nThe hospital's sterile scent and eerie atmosphere only added to the tension, but her daughter's focus was solely on her mother. She quickly ushered her into a treatment room, called out for medical help, and watched as the doctors and nurses swarmed in to attend to her mother's wounds. It turned out her mother had taken a tumble off a step stool while reaching for a vase on the top shelf of their kitchen cabinet. The worry etched on her face gave way to relief as the medical team sprang into action, and she waited anxiously for news about her mother's condition.",
            "A recent study shed light on the benefits of following the Mediterranean Diet, also known as the Med diet. The study found that women who adhered to this diet, as reflected by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" had a lower risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke. The aMed diet is a variation of the Med diet that emphasizes plant-based foods, such as fruits, nuts, whole grains, legumes, and fish, while reducing consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol intake is also allowed.\n\nPast research has consistently shown that a Med diet is associated with a reduced risk of total and heart-related mortality. In fact, one study found that the Med diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and improving cholesterol levels in obese individuals. However, previous studies did not focus specifically on the relationship between the Med diet and stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis new study, which followed 74,886 female nurses over a 20-year period, discovered a significant association between higher aMed diet scores and lower risks of CHD and stroke. The study used data from the Nurses' Health Study, a large cohort study that has been monitoring the health of 121,700 female nurses since 1984. The researchers computed the aMed diet score six times between 1984 and 2004, using self-reported food frequency questionnaires that assessed nutrient intake over the previous year. The study found that a high aMed diet score was associated with a 29% lower risk of CHD and a 29% lower risk of stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile.\n\nTo minimize random variation and better capture long-term dietary habits, the researchers averaged the aMed scores from multiple questionnaires. They also adjusted for various confounding factors, such as age, smoking status, body mass index, menopausal status, and physical activity. The study's findings suggest that following a Mediterranean-style diet may be an effective way to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke in women.",
            "We're still reeling from the aftermath of the 2007 financial crisis that ravaged the United States. The unemployment rate skyrocketed, the housing market imploded, and some of America's most influential corporations were left in shambles. So, let's face it – we're still wondering: how did this disaster unfold, and what can we do to prevent it from happening again? In a nutshell, the crisis was born from a toxic mix of self-serving and naive decision-making that forced banks and financial institutions to hand out sub-prime loans into a fragile financial ecosystem. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were strong-armed into underwriting and repackaging these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks found themselves woefully underfunded, and the chaos spilled over into the re-packaged mortgages they'd sold, ultimately infecting the entire economy.\n\nBut the seeds of this disaster were sown back in the late 1990s, when the Clinton administration was hell-bent on securing a second term in office. To bolster his popularity, they relaxed lending restrictions, creating a perfect storm for the sub-prime crisis that would unfold seven years later. In 1999, New York Times journalist Steven Holmes pointed out the impending doom: \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest mortgage underwriter, was under intense pressure from the Clinton administration to expand mortgage loans to low- and moderate-income households, all while satisfying shareholder demands for phenomenal growth in profits.\" Holmes astutely predicted the consequences of these actions: \"But the government-subsidized corporation might struggle in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As we now know, the results were catastrophic.\n\nA perfect storm of factors contributed to the economic meltdown, including the increasingly complex mortgage landscape. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) became ubiquitous in the years leading up to the crisis, entangling more sectors of the economy in the housing market. This created a housing bubble that left U.S. households and financial markets paper-thin, vulnerable to even the slightest price fluctuations.\n\nIn the end, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were left reeling. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, equivalent to about 30% of the USA's GDP. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at fire-sale prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subject to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were brought under government control in September 2008.",
            "The agony and ecstasy of exposition.  That pivotal moment in your story where you spread your wings and soar, leaving your readers in awe of your masterful prose - or, conversely, nodding off to sleep with a silent curse.  Dr. Merlin has been known to slam her monitor in frustration when she finds herself bogged down in Too Much Information, and not in the good kind of way.\n\nExposition: the nemesis that worms its way into every writer's narrative, begging to be told - and told in excruciating detail.  We've all heard the mantra, \"Show, don't tell,\" but even seasoned writers like Dr. Merlin still find themselves succumbing to the lure of lengthy passages that leave the reader wondering what's happening.  It's the inner voice that whispers, \"Get the backstory out of the way so we can get to the good stuff,\" but in truth, it's often the devil in disguise.\n\nExposition is the act of telling the reader what happened, in straightforward prose.  In film, it's the character's info dump, à la \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, it's the author's way of telling, not showing.  And let's face it, it's a slippery slope.  \n\nConsider this example: a heroine meets her beloved, gets married in a grand ceremony, and her husband is murdered before her eyes.  You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to unfold over two pages, with only two lines of dialogue from each character.  You'd want to see the husband's character shine through in his words and actions, and the heroine's growth and depth as she navigates their relationship.  A proper introduction to the husband would make his death all the more impactful, allowing you to mourn his loss alongside the heroine and deepen your connection to her.  In short, you'd crave substance, not just the bare-bones storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs writers, our task is to deliver that substance.  It's tempting to rush past the details, especially when introducing new characters, but resist the urge.  Don't settle for a superficial \"He used to be in the Air Force, now he's the night manager of a gas station, married twice, no kids, likes fishing on the weekends, dreams of owning the station, and loves Eggs Benedict.\"  Give your readers the richness they deserve - the meat on the bone of your story.",
            "I caught a couple of local news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio – NBC 4's morning newscast on August 13, 2011, being the first. The breaking story was about a man named Shad Hostettler, who'd stabbed his wife in Ashley, Ohio. His mug shot was flashed on screen, and let's just say he didn't exactly exude innocence. The news team barely scratched the surface of the incident, devoting only two minutes to the developing story. I thought that was a fair amount of airtime, considering the gravity of the situation.\n\nThe next story was about an 18-year-old named Travis Buyers, who was shot in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically injured and the police were still looking for leads. I noticed that this story seemed to receive relatively short shrift, which made me wonder if the neighborhood or the victim's ethnicity might have played a role in it getting less attention. I've long been struck by the way the media often glosses over stories involving minorities. When a white person is a victim, the media goes into overdrive, but when it's a minority, they get shortchanged.\n\nThe newscast then moved on to a story about a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. The authorities were tight-lipped about the investigation, but did reveal that a .22 caliber bullet had been fired from a rifle. A $5,000 reward was being offered for information that could lead to the shooter's capture.\n\nNext up was a story about the impending rain and thunderstorms forecast for Saturday afternoon. The weather report was brief, and I think that was intentional – the anchor was using it as a teaser to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nThe broadcast also covered a robbery at a UDF store on Clime Road. The perp was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie and a six-foot tall, 150-pound build. I found it interesting that the anchor emphasized the perpetrator's skin color and the color of his hoodie. It seemed like an unusual amount of time was spent on those details.\n\nAnother story was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin who'd been convicted of conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. I was puzzled by the way the anchor phrased his sentence – instead of saying 25 years in prison, they said 300 months. It wasn't clear what the point of that was. The anchor also mentioned Rodriguez's Hispanic heritage, but I'm not sure why that was relevant to the story.",
            "There's a bond between brothers that's impossible to break - a deep, unshakeable connection that weaves together a complex tapestry of emotions. Love, pride, jealousy, and the darker corners of cruelty all reside within this bond, creating a rich and multifaceted relationship that's both beautiful and brutal. Brothers have an uncanny understanding of one another, one that surpasses even the closest of friendships. When they look at each other, they see pieces of themselves, their own reflections staring back. It's in the darkest of times, when emotions run high, that the true nature of this bond is revealed, for better or for worse. With this bond comes a heavy price - the consequences of the emotions that fuel it. When we gaze into the eyes of a brother and see our own reflection staring back, we catch a glimpse of our true character, stripped bare of the facades we wear for the world. The choices we make and the actions we take are a testament to who we truly are.\n\nIn William Faulkner's \"The Sound and the Fury\" is not the correct text to be rewritten for the prompt, but instead, William Faulkner's short story \"The Old Man\" is not the correct text either. The story which is being rewritten is actually \"The Scarlet Ibis\" by Grant Wiggins. Through its vivid descriptions of a lush landscape, this tale of two brothers explores the intense emotions that come with this fraternal bond. In a heart-wrenching climax, bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride, and only one brother emerges unscathed. The author masterfully conveys the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist, Doodle, and his brother, as well as the narrator's observations, which serve as a powerful commentary on the true nature of their relationship. The protagonist's every move is driven by a single emotion: pride. From their early days together to their fateful final excursion, he harbors resentment towards his little brother, Doodle, who was born with a weak heart, making it impossible for him to participate in the adventurous life that his brother had envisioned. This crushing blow left the young protagonist reeling, his dreams of a playmate shattered in an instant. His anger towards Doodle is evident, as he even contemplates taking his life by suffocating him with a pillow - a chilling revelation that speaks to the darker corners of his heart. However, a simple smile from Doodle brings his brother's anger to the surface, revealing a glimmer of love and hope that had been lurking beneath. This moment of tenderness humanizes the protagonist, showing that his conviction was never as strong as he thought, and that love had always been present, even if it was hidden beneath the surface.",
            "It's no secret that the human brain is a complex, ever-evolving machine that processes information in ways both mysterious and miraculous. As technology has advanced from the Stone Age to the digital age, the metaphors used to describe our brains have evolved as well. Initially, our brain was likened to a piece of wax, then a scroll, then a book, and most recently, a supercomputer. While these analogies have served as a starting point for our understanding, it's essential to remember that they're limited and can lead us down the rabbit hole of misconceptions.\n\nSo, let's dive into the brain's inner workings. Information starts its journey as sensory input from our organs, which convert physical stimuli such as touch, heat, light, or sound waves into electrical signals. The brain then takes over, processing this info through a series of intricate algorithms that involve both bottom-up and top-down processing. Imagine looking at a picture of a black box on a white background. Bottom-up processing would break down the image into its basic components – color, orientation, and object borders – to conclude that you're seeing a box. Top-down processing, on the other hand, uses the decisions made earlier to speed up your recognition, perhaps identifying the object as a black box rather than a hole in the background.\n\nOnce the brain has processed the information to a certain degree, an attention filter kicks in, deciding which signals are most important and which cognitive processes to engage. Think of it like trying to find your name in a crowded room – your brain filters out the noise and zooms in on what matters. This attention filter is a crucial step in information processing, and it's a process that happens repeatedly throughout.\n\nFor the brain to process information effectively, it first needs to store it. We have different types of memory – sensory, working, and long-term – each with its own unique characteristics. The process begins with encoding, where information is transformed into a format that the brain can understand. For example, verbal input can be encoded based on its visual appearance, sound, or meaning. From there, the information needs to be maintained, and research suggests that working memory stores data for about 20 seconds by creating an electrical loop through a series of neurons. Long-term memory, on the other hand, is thought to be stored in the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are many theories about how knowledge is organized in the brain, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some are based on human behavior, others on computer science, and others on neurophysiology. One such model, the semantic network, proposes that our brain represents concepts as nodes linked by their relatedness. For instance, in this network, \"chair\" might be connected to \"table,\" which in turn is connected to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley's dystopian novel, Brave New World, serves as a scathing critique of the emerging technological and capitalistic structures of his time. In this fictional world, people prioritize community over individuality, and are conditioned from a young age to pursue instant gratification above all else. The citizens are mere pawns in a grand game, confined to a single ideology dictated by the all-powerful World Controller. Analyzing the novel through a Marxist lens reveals Huxley's underlying concerns about the developing systems. His use of Marxist terminology, such as homogeny and reification, underscores his suspicions about the flaws in the economy of his era.\n\nCapitalism is satirized through the concept of false consciousness, where the common citizen is kept in the dark about their true relationships with other classes in economic terms. Instead, they are preoccupied with their own selfish interests. This ideological control is evident in the conditioning of the population through hypnopædia, which strengthens their drive to consume, spend, and indulge above all else. The World Controller manipulates this conditioning, as we've seen, to maintain the status quo. Hegemony, the idea of groups being dominated by a separate, more powerful group, is a clear example of this in Brave New World. The working classes are blissfully unaware of their manipulation, essentially buying into an ideology that upholds the system (capitalism and consumerism). Meanwhile, the upper classes are aware of the manipulation but choose to do nothing, accepting their place in the hierarchy.\n\nIn Huxley's world, genuine relationships between individuals are few and far between. The characters, even major ones, lack depth and substance. One cannot help but wonder if Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together strips people of their free will and self-expression. Love and intense emotions are nonexistent; interactions are kept superficial, as seen in the males' shallow comments about women's physical appearance and the females' candid discussions of their encounters. Furthermore, the complacency of each social class in their position within the hierarchy reflects the socioeconomic effects of capitalism, where the proletariat is falsely convinced of their superiority as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform to their peers.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for roughly two and a half years now – four and a half semesters, give or take. For many of us, navigating the campus can be a real challenge. My first year in the East Halls dorm, nestled in the far reaches of campus, was a testament to this. The trek from my digs in Stuart Hall to places like the Willard building, near the heart of campus, often took up to 25 minutes on foot, especially when the unpredictable Penn State weather decided to make its presence known. I spoke with an alum not much older than myself, and it turned out that not too long ago, the East Halls dorms were effectively separated from the rest of the university by a vast expanse of unused land. Fast forward to today, and that empty space has been transformed into a thriving complex of sports fields, sleek new buildings, and trendy apartments, including the new Creamery and health services building. As our campus continues to expand, so do our transportation woes. What's the solution to this mobility conundrum? On a college campus, I firmly believe that the bicycle is the answer. However, a bike alone won't cut it; students need to hop on and the campus infrastructure needs to cater to cyclists' needs.\n\nI recently chatted with a friend who'd recently dusted off his bike after a few years away from it. He mused, \"Bikes are great – for a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Beyond being great exercise, bicycling is a highly efficient mode of transportation. A hearty bowl of oatmeal and a bit of physical exertion can take you 30 miles or more. As someone who now resides off campus, just as far from the heart of campus as some dorms, I made the smart move of investing in a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from my place. My trusty bike, on the other hand, can get me there in under 5 minutes, provided I pedal hard enough. The only catch is that Pollock Road is the most direct route to Thomas building, but it's not always the most bike-friendly road. I've found that walking has its merits, but I'm a busy bee and can't afford the extra time. Without my bike, walking would be my only reliable option, and it would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my day, devouring over two and a half hours every week. Factor in the time spent walking to and from other classes, appointments, and the like, and I'd be losing precious time I can ill afford to spare."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "As I navigate my educational path in social work, I envision a career within the Division of Family and Children Services, dedicated to supporting children who've endured abuse or neglect. My goal is to provide a helping hand to troubled families, and in doing so, I aim to instill a sense of service, respect, and a commitment to fostering meaningful relationships. These core values aren't merely essential for social workers; they're deeply ingrained in my own personal philosophy.\n\nGrowing up, I've always felt an innate desire to aid others, yet I was uncertain about the career path that aligned with my passions. Throughout high school and college, I witnessed individuals escaping their problems through denial, while others employed coping mechanisms that didn't exactly inspire confidence. The situations I saw sparked a fire within me, and I decided to pursue a degree in Psychology. Even after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I still felt uncertain about my career path. That all changed one summer, when I visited a friend who was hosting a 16-year-old boy who'd fled his abusive home. I soon discovered that this young individual had reached out to the authorities for help. The next day, I accompanied the police to his parents' residence, where I shared my concerns and introduced myself as a recent Psychology graduate. The police asked me to speak with the parents, citing a lack of jurisdiction. When I questioned them about the situation, their nervous demeanor and excuses for their son's actions only solidified my resolve to pursue a career in social work, focusing on helping children navigate \"simple\" disputes within family dynamics.\n\nFor me, social justice is another crucial value in the field of social work. We often tout the importance of individuality, yet our society often pressures people to conform to archaic norms. I, on the other hand, relish being an individual and refuse to be bound by the need to fit in. Throughout my high school and college years, I made my stance against social injustices whenever I could: I dyed my hair unconventional colors, wore clothing that expressed my personality, got piercings that defied traditional standards, joined the GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and spoke out against racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it. Social justice is a cause I'm deeply passionate about, and I'll continue to advocate for it.",
            "I've dug into the complex world of insomnia, examining the biological and sociocultural models that attempt to grasp this elusive disorder. The biological model zeroes in on the genetic factors we inherit, as well as the medical aspects of health that influence our sleep patterns. On the other hand, the sociocultural model delves into the environmental factors, like our racial, ethnic, demographic, and socioeconomic backgrounds, which all play a significant role in our sleep habits.\n\nInsomnia can be categorized into three primary types: primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders linked to other mental health conditions, and those caused by medical issues or substance intake. The primary sleep disorders include Dyssonmias and Parasomnias. Dyssonmias encompass a range of difficulties, such as Primary Insomnia, where we struggle to fall asleep or stay asleep, and Primary Hypersomnia, which makes it hard to stay awake for extended periods. Narcolepsy, on the other hand, involves cataplexy and automatic REM sleep. Parasomnias, meanwhile, are sleep disorders associated with behavioral and physiological anomalies, like Nightmare Disorder and Sleepwalking Disorder.\n\nNow, let's dive into the biological model, which focuses on the genetic and physiological aspects of sleep disorders. Research has shown that neurons in the hypothalamus, specifically those containing orexin, play a crucial role in regulating our sleep-wake cycles. A study involving mice discovered that phenotypic GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons are responsible for sleep-wake states. When these receptors are activated, it promotes sleep, while their inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and increased sleepiness. The study found that a GABAB agonist, baclofen, increased sleep time in mice, suggesting that this genetic and environmental factor can also affect humans. This implies that a problem or absence of this receptor could disrupt our ability to sleep soundly without medication.\n\nThe sociocultural implications of this study are significant. If the GABAB receptor is inherited, it could play a crucial role in regulating our sleep patterns, and any alterations to this receptor could naturally disrupt our sleep, impacting various aspects of our lives, from school and career to daily tasks and focus. This highlights the complex interplay between our genetic makeup and environmental factors in shaping our sleep habits and overall well-being.",
            "I'm diving into the complex world of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD). It's time to break down the basics. To start, let's define CAPD: it's the way our brain processes what we hear. More specifically, it's a condition where the central nervous system (CNS) has trouble deciphering auditory information. This doesn't mean that someone with CAPD is hard of hearing; it's that the brain's ability to filter out background noise, separate words, and understand the sequence of sounds is impaired.\n\nAs I dug into the history of CAPD, I found that the concept of auditory imperception dates back to the 1950s. Researchers like Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for children with communication disorders back in 1954. The field continued to evolve, with Kimura introducing dichotic testing and a model to explain the brain's auditory processing in 1961. A 1977 national conference further sparked research on CAPD.\n\nPeople with CAPD struggle in various ways: they might have trouble pinpointing the source of a sound, distinguishing between multiple sounds, recognizing patterns, or picking up on subtle changes in speech. It's also common for one sound to be masked by another, making it difficult to interpret the sequence of auditory information. They might even struggle to synthesize sound clues, which can impact their ability to respond meaningfully.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD requires a systematic observation of listening behavior and performance on tests of auditory function. Audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other professionals use a range of measures to evaluate auditory-related skills. These might include questionnaires, surveys, and observations of how the individual responds to different stimuli. The challenge is that there's no single diagnostic tool that consistently yields accurate results, and the cause of CAPD remains unknown.\n\nTests often present the individual with multiple sounds simultaneously and ask them to differentiate specific items, such as words or numbers. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the brain's response to these signals.\n\nAs a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom, understanding CAPD can help you better support students with this condition. By being aware of the challenges they face, you can adapt your teaching methods to accommodate their unique needs.",
            "Twelfth Night appears to reveal a paradoxical truth: while adopting a disguise can be an effective means of deception, it ultimately requires a person to shed that facade, lest they lose themselves in the process. However, breaking free from a deception can come at a steep price – social isolation. This leaves the individual facing a difficult choice: protect their own identity or preserve relationships with those around them. The consequences of being discovered can be severe, ranging from indifference to outright offense.\n\nThe theme of deception through gender role reversal poses a particularly complex set of questions. Why do individuals feel compelled to abandon their true selves and assume an alternate identity? In Viola's case, her motivation is rooted in self-preservation: \"I'll take you to a trusted leader in this town, where I've found safety, thanks to the kindness of those who've helped me serve this noble count.\" (Act 5, Scene 1, lines 247-249) Having arrived in an unfamiliar land, Viola resorts to disguise to safeguard herself from potential threats. Her ruse succeeds, but it also isolates her from the women who could offer emotional support.\n\nViola's dual identity creates an added layer of complexity, as she's so convincing in her masculine guise that Olivia becomes infatuated with her, mistaking her for her twin brother, Sebastian. Furthermore, Viola struggles with repressed romantic feelings for Orsino: \"You've told me countless times that you'll never love a woman like me,\" (Act 5, Scene 1, lines 260-261) suggesting that deception can, in fact, facilitate the exposure of submerged emotions.\n\nWhile this may seem progressive by modern standards, Twelfth Night can be seen as a commentary on how deception can force individuals to confront their true desires. Certain passages hint that Olivia and Orsino may have unexplored feelings that are only revealed through Viola's disguise. Olivia's swift shift from romantic interest in Cesario to familial affection suggests that she may be parodying the societal norms of her time, judging people based on appearances rather than substance.",
            "The brutal nature of German colonial rule has been a topic of discussion among historians, particularly in regards to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, the German colonial empire was a complex entity with diverse policies and ruling styles, much like its varied geography. Education, too, was a patchwork across the colonies, with some receiving better support than others. When the British took over German East Africa in 1919, they found a population of educated and literate Africans, which stood in stark contrast to other colonies. The German colonial efforts in Kamerun and elsewhere were similarly praised by authors of the time.\n\nBut German South West Africa, now modern-day Namibia, was a different story altogether. Unlike East Africa, where the government invested heavily in state schools and education, South West Africa left the education of locals largely to missionary societies that operated on limited government funding. The government did, however, provide significant resources to educate Europeans in the colony, establishing state schools and heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. This approach had lasting effects on South West Africa, with its legacy continuing long after German rule. While other German colonies had significant numbers of educated Africans, in South West Africa, the majority of the population remained uneducated and illiterate. The divergent experiences of South West Africa were influenced by a complex array of social, political, and economic factors, which this paper aims to explore in more detail.\n\nExisting literature on education in the German colonial empire is vast and mostly written in German, with a focus on describing the colonial education systems during or shortly after the colonial period. Later works, written in English, expanded the discussion through comparative studies and in-depth analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted the significant differences between the educational systems of various German colonies, including a notable comparison between South West Africa and East Africa by Cohen. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa played a significant role in shaping the colony's educational system.\n\nThe climate of South West Africa, characterized by a moderately temperate climate with arid desert regions, attracted a relatively large European population. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, far outnumbering the European population in other colonies, such as East Africa, which had only 5,336 settlers.",
            "Fast forward to the past 100 years and the sheer explosion of popular music genres is staggering. It's a jungle out there, and with so many branches sprouting off the main tree, it's tough to keep track of them all. Sub-genres like death metal, grindcore, and power metal have sprouted from the likes of rock, country, jazz, and folk, each with their own unique offspring. I'd argue that heavy metal, in particular, has become the most dynamic and expressive genre of all, with a range of emotions that skew towards the darker side. It's as if the genre has an insatiable appetite for innovation, with artists pushing the boundaries and creating their own niches, which in turn give rise to even more sub-sub-genres.\n\nToday, heavy metal has evolved into a behemoth, with so many sub-niches that it's challenging to define what heavy metal even is. It's been shaped by influences from other genres, but its roots run deep. To truly understand the metal music that permeates our airwaves, we need to grasp the essence of the metal movement and why it's more than just a genre.\n\nAt its core, metal is a movement defined by its affinity for the darker side of life. It's the \"more\" that sets it apart – more bass, more volume, more aggression, more theatrics. It's a world where musicians are not just hobbyists, but masters of their craft, with chops that shine through in their music. And, if we're being honest, metal has a long history of being fueled by the excesses of the 1970s psychedelic drug culture. The resulting records were like nothing the world had ever heard before, with artists using their experiences with psychedelics as a catalyst for creativity. Heavy metal's visceral qualities were a breath of fresh air in an industry that had grown stale, and later generations drew inspiration from the Romantic Era's darker themes. Even the Beatles, with their iconic song Helter Skelter, experimented with the heavier side of the musical spectrum, paving the way for the likes of heavy metal.",
            "Decades before the Surrealists were painting their dreamlike masterpieces, Henri Rousseau was living his own surreal dream. His 1910 painting, The Dream, is a window into not only the woman in awe of the wonders of the land she visits within her dreams, but also Rousseau's own long-held aspirations and inner turmoil as an artist. For years, he yearned for recognition, validation, and admiration from his fellow artists and art enthusiasts, yet he found himself torn between conforming to the art world's expectations and forging his own path. This internal struggle defines The Dream, a work that encapsulates Rousseau's career-long conflict: should he play it safe by mimicking the styles of others or take a chance on being unique and staying true to himself?\n\nTo truly understand the significance of The Dream, it's essential to delve into Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in the quaint town of Laval in northwest France, Henri was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer who enjoyed a comfortable middle-class lifestyle. Growing up, he didn't receive formal art training; instead, he worked as a municipal toll collector, earning him the nickname douanier, or customs inspector. The loss of his first wife, Clémence, and eight of their infant children left Rousseau heartbroken and with only one daughter, Julia, to care for. Painting became his refuge, a way to escape the darkness and find solace. Unlike his contemporaries, who idealized and romanticized the peasant class, Rousseau was a folk painter, driven by the hopes and dreams of the common man.\n\nRousseau's desire for acceptance by the art world is understandable, given his late start and lack of formal training. He began his career at a time when many other talented artists were already making a name for themselves. It wasn't until around the same time that Matisse was establishing himself as a renowned artist that Rousseau finally started to gain recognition. As art historian Jan Gordon noted in Modern French Painters, Rousseau and Matisse were polar opposites, not only in style and subject matter but also in their motivations: while Matisse sought to create something original, Rousseau aimed to produce a work so conventional that it would earn him acceptance into the Artiste Français.",
            "Philosophers have long pondered the connection between ethics and aesthetics, suggesting that truth and beauty are intertwined. In my opinion, there's a fundamental reason for this relationship. As John Keats so eloquently put it in his poem \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty— / That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" We learn a lot in life through education and experience, but our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics seems to come from a deeper place. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe, rather than prescribe. When we study morality and beauty, we're really trying to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful or why an action is moral, rather than creating a set of rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nIn essence, criticism of art or morals can never fully capture the essence of what's good or beautiful. A discussion about the value of the Mona Lisa might focus on aspects like composition, contrast, or cultural context, but these don't actually explain why it's great art. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often say something like, \"There's just something about it\" before providing a more complex analysis. I believe that art and morals can't be reduced to a description of their qualities alone. As Flannery O'Connor once said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way...you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we describe a work of literature, there's always something more that can't be put into words.\n\nSimilarly, ethics has this transcendent quality. As Wittgenstein noted, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed / Ethics is transcendental.\" I propose that it's this \"something\" – this je ne sais quoi – that's the most powerful aspect of both art and morality, and that this transcendental nature provides a connection between them.\n\nI think morality and art are closely related because we experience both at a level that's hard to explain or fully grasp, what the philosopher Kant calls the \"noumenal.\" They impact us in a way that's both profound and ineffable. This connection is even stronger when it comes to literature. As McKean argues, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about literature, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself.\" After all, living necessarily involves values, and literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.",
            "Germany, the powerhouse of today, is a nation with a rich cultural tapestry woven from diverse threads that stretch from the shadow of the Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. The same unique cultural essence resonates from the banks of the Rhine River in Cologne to the heart of the country, and all the way to the historic city of Dresden on the Elbe River. It's no surprise, then, that modern-day Germany has a complex heritage, with its roots tracing back to various tribes and sources. \n\nThe origins of the name 'Germany' are shrouded in mystery, with scholars and historians hotly debating its etymology. According to ancient Roman historian Tacitus, the name might have come from the Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, who were previously referred to as Germans before crossing the Rhine and clashing with the Gaulish forces. However, Julius Caesar, who first used the term 'Germanus' in his Gallic Wars commentary, believed it was derived from the Gauls themselves. He used this term to distinguish between the Gauls he had conquered and those he had yet to subdue. While the true origins remain unclear, some speculate that it could refer to a neighboring tribe in the Gaulish language. In his Gaulic Wars account, Caesar notes that the Germans lived beyond the Rhine, constantly at odds with the Gauls in almost daily battles. Others propose that the name 'Germany' might be linked to the spear the tribes used in warfare, known as a 'ger', or the Old Irish word 'garim', meaning 'to shout', implying the Germans were known for their loud and boisterous nature. \n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus, writing in AD 98, penned an account of the Germans' origins in his work 'De Origine et situ Germanorum'. He described the Germans as an indigenous people, untouched by external influences, who arrived by ship rather than land. He quipped that who would knowingly leave sunny Italy for Germany's harsh climate, rugged terrain, and gruff demeanor? It's unlikely the Romans would venture into Germania, at least not yet. They would send expeditions to trade and lead occasional military campaigns but ultimately return to their vast empire. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they lived on the fringes of the Roman Empire, trading their goods and skills to Roman soldiers. This complex history laid the groundwork for the modern Germany we know today.",
            "As I stood there, my gaze drifted down, my mind a complete blank.  I stared at the scene before me, my thoughts drifting in and out without leaving any lasting impression.  My mind was a smooth, efficient machine, processing the visual information in front of me without any emotional resonance.  Ideas danced across my mind, only to vanish as quickly as they appeared.\n\nI'd picked up an art instruction book, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,\" after taking advice from a fellow artist I worked with.  I'd always been fascinated by drawing, ever since I was a six-year-old, and this book promised to teach me the fundamentals, from understanding the humble pencil to the brain's process of interpreting lines.  One technique it taught was to frame a picture with a square, simplifying the complex into something easily graspable – like that bowl of fruit on the table, now just a simple, two-dimensional shape.\n\nAs I gazed at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't mentally impose that frame.  I was overwhelmed, awestruck – and all I could do was stand there, mesmerized.  Great artists like Picasso and Monet had their own signatures – blue and green, respectively – and the Italian Renaissance masters splashed across the spectrum.  If I wanted to call myself an artist, this bowl was where my story began, my Work in Brown.\n\nMy hand hesitated above the drawing tool, then moved down, my fingers making contact with the paper.  My mind's creative energy surged, as it had only a few moments before, when I'd raised the toilet plunger to tackle the clogged commode.  Water swirled, smooth and serene, but this time I was after something more tangible – a stubborn brown mass that refused to budge, stuck to the toilet like a slug on a cold surface.  I gripped the mop loosely, my feet shoulder-width apart, my tie constricting my neck.  A frown creased my face as I glared at the offending package, a messy bundle of processed food and waste, a message left for the maintenance crew at Rite Aid.  More flushes, a few more contemplative moments, and my hand reached for the toilet paper, mummifying itself into a makeshift shield.  Then, with a measured movement, I dipped my hand into the bowl, like a cook preparing a Thanksgiving turkey for the oven.",
            "Thanks to the National Institutes of Health, we've had a glimpse of the grim reality behind the wheel. Teenagers are dying in alarming numbers, and the statistics are a stark reminder of the deadly vectors that converge to create this crisis. It's a perfect storm of factors, and one of the most striking is the simple truth that the teen brain just isn't equipped to handle the perils of driving. Inexperience is another major culprit, leading not only to a higher number of fatal accidents but also a greater likelihood of vehicle rollover, speeding, and veering off the road. \n\nAdding to the problem is the notion that teens tend to fare worse when cruising with their peers – a scenario that's all too common. A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center revealed a disturbing correlation between passenger age and traffic accidents. It's a phenomenon that's as predictable as it is heartbreaking.\n\nIn response, California and other states have implemented provisional licenses to curb the carnage. These temporary permits limit driving hours and ban other minors as passengers, but I believe they're little more than a Band-Aid on a gaping wound. The real issue is that, by all statistical markers, the youngest drivers are simply not equipped to handle the risks and responsibilities that come with getting behind the wheel. Even psychologist Marvin Zuckerman thinks 18 is too young for a full driver's license, citing research that suggests a common desire among those under 19 or 20 to take risks for the thrill of it. It's a pattern that's hard to ignore, and one that makes a strong case for delaying driving until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to subside.\n\nIf we continue to issue driver's licenses to young teens, we'll see more and more deadly accidents – and the death toll will keep rising. By 2010, the Baby Boomer's children will be hitting the road in droves, and the consequences will be catastrophic. It's time for a more proactive approach, one that involves legislation to address this growing crisis.\n\nA reasonable solution would be to make driver's education classes a staple of high school curricula, but with one key caveat: no one under 18 should be allowed to get behind the wheel. A provisional permit could still be issued, but only after completing a certain number of practical driver's training hours – say, the 6 hours and 50 hours of practice already required in California. Uniform national legislation would be a powerful tool in protecting teens across the country, and it's an idea that's not exactly new. So, let's get behind it and make our roads safer for everyone.",
            "I recently spent hours browsing the Library of Congress's vast collection of early Edison films, but I zeroed in on the trick films from 1895 to 1901. There were fifteen of them, and I was determined to watch them all. These films relied heavily on creative editing to create illusions that would leave viewers mesmerized. As I delved deeper into the world of trick films, I found myself fascinated by the poetics behind most of them and the evolutionary characteristics that began to emerge in a few of the later ones. The majority of trick films from the turn of the century are static, confined to a frontal proscenium, and stick to a rigid one shot equals one film approach. They feature long and medium shots, with no camera movement to speak of. However, as we move into the early twentieth century, a few trailblazers dare to break free from these conventions by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nOne of the most striking commonalities among these trick films is the use of an interior set within a frontal proscenium frame. The camera remains stationary, never deviating from its position to follow characters or objects. This composition draws its roots from the theater and, in the case of trick films, vaudeville and magic shows. The limitations of this approach are evident in the way characters usually move side-to-side, never walking towards or away from the camera. Take, for instance, the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis, never straying from this pattern.\n\nThe use of a frontal proscenium also means that shots tend to be long and, occasionally, medium shots. Close-ups are a rarity in these trick films from the Edison catalog, a nod to the theater and vaudeville tradition where the audience sees the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in many early films, actors rarely move towards the camera, making close-ups a distant memory.\n\nMost early trick films adhere to the rule that one conceptual shot equals one film. This limits their length to around a minute or less, depending on the frame rate used. As a result, these films typically focus on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing acts, and quick switches, with little narrative or dramatic depth. However, upon closer inspection, you'll notice that what appears to be one conceptual shot can actually be several joined together to create a seamless illusion. Take, for example, The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), an early trick film that reveals a clever editing trick when you look closely.",
            "The name John Taylor of Caroline was synonymous with unwavering dedication to the principles of Republicanism. As an agriculturalist by trade and a brief stint in politics, he left an indelible mark on the discourse around personal freedom and government. His passion for an agrarian lifestyle served as the foundation for his opinions on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the judicial system. His stance was firmly rooted in his desire to preserve and promote what he deemed the most noble of all professions.\n\nTaylor believed the United States had a unique opportunity to craft an ideal system, unencumbered by traditional constraints that often hindered the development of new societies. This blank slate allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government that he passionately advocated for. He firmly believed in the inherent rights of individuals, which he saw as interconnected – when one right was compromised, the value of the others diminished. As such, these rights should be shielded from government interference. In his view, the concept of the 'state of nature' implied that those with physical strength and cunning would thrive, but in a civilized society, this shouldn't be the case.\n\nTo create an ideal society, Taylor believed a government must be designed to account for the duality of human nature – both good and evil. He rigidly adhered to a dualistic morality, arguing that as government is exercised by humans, it will inevitably reflect both virtues and vices. He defined good principles as those that protect private property, promote agriculture, and discourage the excesses of capitalism. Taylor firmly believed that a government founded on these principles would function equitably, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by avarice and self-interest. However, he noted that self-interest, though a fundamental aspect of human nature, only became problematic when it led to the creation of sub-societies that exploited others.\n\nTaylor, like many of his fellow Republicans, advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution. He envisioned a limited Federal government with only the powers explicitly stated in the Constitution, recognizing that an extensive Federal government would be expensive and prone to despotism. However, he also believed that a literal interpretation of the Constitution without considering the intent of its writers could lead to corruption. Furthermore, he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it more explicitly described the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Looking back at the data, it's clear that there was a drastic drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of our project. That was a bit disheartening, and pinpointing the cause is a challenge. It's not hard to imagine that the onset of a New England winter would lead to fewer cyclists and pedestrians commuting to campus, which could account for part of the decline. With the end of the fall semester in December comes a busy time for students and faculty, finishing up schoolwork, processing grades, and gearing up for the holiday season. It's likely that filling out the commuter log got buried under the hectic pace of the time. And then there's the month-long break that accompanies the holiday season, during which many students and faculty hardly set foot on campus. Classes resume in late January, which might explain the low number of logs for that month, too. But the low numbers in February remain a puzzle.\n\nOne possible explanation is that any project of this type tends to experience a natural ebb in enthusiasm and energy at the outset, followed by a gradual decline. To combat this trend, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week, a special campaign in March to reignite the initiative, which indeed led to an uptick in log submissions that month. This highlights one of the challenges we faced: maintaining project momentum in the face of natural fluctuations and the specific hurdles of the academic calendar.\n\nAnother hurdle we encountered is the deeply ingrained cultural preference for driving one's own car, which provides a sense of freedom, independence, and flexibility. To encourage alternative modes of commuting, we offered incentives in the form of gift certificates to local businesses like restaurants, coffee shops, and the local independent bookstore. It would have been interesting to see how larger prizes might have affected participation – think a brand-new bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have helped combat that decline in engagement we experienced. The prizes remained the same throughout the project, but if we had announced bigger and better prizes as the project progressed – say, adding a couple of bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January – it's likely that participation and engagement would have increased instead of decreased.",
            "The exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a game-changer in the world of investments. Imagine having the diversification of a mutual fund and the agility of individual stock trading all wrapped up in one convenient package. That's essentially what an ETF offers. You get the best of both worlds - the stability of a broad-based index fund and the flexibility to buy and sell as you please, even shorting or trading on margin. And the icing on the cake? ETFs come with significantly lower expense ratios compared to the average mutual fund.\n\nOf course, there are some downsides to consider. Trading ETFs involves paying a commission, just like you would with individual stocks. But the benefits far outweigh the costs. With a staggering array of funds to choose from, you can pick and choose the ones that fit your investment goals and risk tolerance. So, what's the best way to evaluate an ETF? A savvy investor would do well to dig deeper and assess whether the touted benefits, like diversification, really deliver. For the sake of this exercise, we'll be taking a closer look at the ETF IHF and its top 10 holdings to see whether owning a single ETF can match the benefits of a diversified portfolio of individual stocks.\n\nTo keep things manageable, we're focusing on the top 10 holdings, which account for a whopping 63.58% of the ETF's assets. Here they are, along with their respective percentages. We'll use these holdings to estimate how well they represent the ETF as a whole. By normalizing their assets to 100%, we can calculate their individual contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return, as if the portfolio consisted solely of these 10 stocks in the same proportions as the ETF.\n\nThe chart reveals an interesting finding: a portfolio consisting only of the top 10 holdings would yield a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, a 16% boost in returns. Furthermore, the Beta of this portfolio is 0.12 lower than the ETF's. This suggests that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings might offer higher returns with lower risk. But are these findings statistically significant? To find out, we'll examine the standard deviation of each of these top 10 stocks, normalized to 100%, and compare them to the ETF's accumulated standard deviation.",
            "In the realm of poetry, Edgar Allan Poe's \"Dream-Land\" stands out as one of his masterpieces. The term \"Thulé\" pops up twice in this poem, lines 6 and 56, a nod to the ancient world that Poe was deeply familiar with. In fact, \"Thulé\" has its roots in Virgil's time, referring to an island north of Britain that the Greeks believed marked the edge of the known world. While Virgil did indeed use the term, there's another source that deserves credit - Poe's fascination with German literature, particularly the works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.\n\nThis tidbit is significant because it reveals Poe's admiration for Goethe's writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" points out the striking similarities between their poems, suggesting that Poe was, in fact, inspired by Goethe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature notes that Goethe was a celebrated poet, best known for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" which was published in two parts - the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe's passing. Within \"Faust's\" second part lies a haunting poem called \"The King of Thulé,\" which tells the story of a king whose wife dies, leaving him heartbroken and lost in grief. He spends his days drinking and crying, eventually giving up his kingdom and life, casting his belongings into the ocean. The king's tale bears an uncanny resemblance to the protagonist in \"Dream-Land,\" who finds himself lost in a dark, lonely world, haunted by memories of loved ones and a world devoid of color.\n\nPoe references Thule twice in his writings, using the phrase \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and \"Dream-Land\" as bookends. These two poems can be seen as companion pieces, with \"The King of Thulé\" serving as a precursor to \"Dream-Land.\" In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a desolate landscape, where shadows loom large and color is absent, a world that eerily mirrors Goethe's \"The King of Thulé,\" where the king's loss of his wife has left him a hollow shell of his former self. Given Poe's admiration for Alfred Tennyson, it's likely that he was familiar with Goethe's work through various reproductions and adaptations that were circulating after the original publication.",
            "In the Golden State of California, if a shopper gets hurt after slipping on an applesauce spill at the grocery store and then sues the store for punitive damages, can they succeed if they prove the store manager acted with malice? The manager, Paul Martin, was told about the spill twice - once by Rich Wayne at 5:00 pm and again by Mary J. Haddigan at 5:15 pm - but chose to keep eating dinner instead of having it cleaned up by 5:30 pm. So, did Martin show a \"willful and conscious disregard\" for the potential harm caused by the spill? To get punitive damages, the shopper, Jennifer Palmer, will need to show that Martin knew the spill could cause harm because multiple customers had fallen in the same spot before her accident. Palmer may argue that Martin was deliberately ignoring the safety of his customers by not cleaning up the spill, especially considering six slip-and-fall incidents happened at D&D Markets in 2009. While this argument might not be a slam dunk, it's still a reasonable claim given the evidence. \n\nLet's take a closer look at what happened. On October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne told Martin about the applesauce spill, and Martin basically said he was too busy eating dinner to care. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also informed Martin about the spill, and he responded with the same attitude. It's no coincidence that Palmer slipped and fell on the spill at 5:30 pm, and it's no surprise that she's now suing D&D Markets for compensation and punitive damages. The question is whether Palmer has a strong enough case to win punitive damages. In California, a person can receive punitive damages if the other party acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" The law defines malice as either intending to cause harm or being downright despicable and recklessly disregarding the rights or safety of others. \n\nSo, will the court dismiss Palmer's case or let it move forward? To determine this, we need to look at whether Martin's actions were malicious. According to the law, conduct is malicious if it's a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights when the defendant knows the probable harm of their actions and chooses to ignore it. In this case, Martin was aware of the potential danger of the spill because several customers had already fallen in the same area, and he still chose to do nothing. This is why Palmer's lawyer will likely argue that Martin's actions were despicable and warrant punitive damages.",
            "Almost four years ago, I took a course in Islam at CBC, where one of the most heated debates in class centered around whether Islam is a hostile religion. This question seems even more pertinent today than ever before. Looking back on the years since 9/11, I've noticed that mass media has swung from a hostile view of Islam to an extreme level of tolerance in America. We've come a long way, and it's hard to imagine that in 2001, we wouldn't have seen a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, who has an openly acknowledged Muslim background in his family.\n\nThe Biography of the Prophet has been a fascinating study for me, as it reveals a Muhammad that contradicts what I previously thought. What I knew of Muhammad's history suggested he was a forceful leader who forced conversions to Islam, conquering tribes and imposing his faith on them. However, the biography portrays Muhammad as a humble, misunderstood, and even self-effacing martyr, who attracted followers one by one through the truth of his teachings.\n\nSome striking similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the miracles attributed to Muhammad have also caught my attention. One such example is when Muhammad multiplied mutton and milk to feed forty men, much like the miracle stories associated with Jesus. I suspect that the writers aimed to present Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove himself, but lived in truth and performed miracles. This approach, in my view, diminishes the significance of Jesus' life and miracles, much like taking credit for someone else's achievements.\n\nFurthermore, the biography seems to be driven by an agenda to provide evidence of witness and spontaneous conversions to Islam, with many stories presented through third-party accounts. This makes me skeptical, as it diminishes the authenticity of the stories and implies a level of fabrication. It's as if they're trying to create a narrative that undermines the integrity of the original accounts.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this work is the attempt to portray Muhammad as a godly figure, humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. History, however, suggests that Muhammad's rise to power was far from gentle, and I wonder if today's Muslims are aware of the true complexities behind their prophet's story.",
            "The teachings of Jesus and the core beliefs he held during his life were quickly lost in the sands of time as Christianity evolved after his passing. When we view this history from a broad perspective, we notice a trend of Christianity drifting further and further away from its roots. Today, we're witnessing a growing awareness and an unprecedented shift towards progress. While traditionalists cling to the status quo and resist any departure from established dogma, this segment of the population may not hold enough sway to shape the entire narrative. As time progresses, a growing awareness of Christian history will emerge, and a yearning will develop to distinguish the doctrines that have been added to Christianity over the centuries from the original intent of the faith's namesake. It may take decades or even centuries, but the inevitable outcome will be a reversal of the trend in Christian history. The movement will slowly but surely peel back the layers of doctrine, reversing the clock as it were, until only the fundamental principles introduced by Jesus on behalf of God remain. When this shift sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing the masses, the church as an institution will continue to thrive, but its teachings will become more uniform and less diverse. Regions, denominations, and divisions will begin to resemble each other more closely, rather than showcasing their differences. History is replete with examples of such reversions – consider how the Roman Empire once persecuted Christians, only to later become a bastion of Christianity, or how the United States transitioned from slavery to African-American leadership. The great reversion that's on the horizon will play out in the realm of the Christian faith, as we seek to return to the source and, in the process, shed our diversity. A crucial aspect of this journey will be reinterpreting Jesus' words as metaphors rather than literal statements. So, what's changed since Jesus' time?\n\nLooking back through the mists of history, we find that the only existing faith was Judaism, the theological foundation of the Christian religion. By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were established at the core of this faith. However, the Jewish population was not a monolith; they divided into the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common people, each with their own distinct perspectives.",
            "The Jungle is a thought-provoking novel that forces us to confront the harsh realities of human nature. Beneath the surface, we're all driven by our own self-interest, prioritizing our own desires above the needs of others. This self-centeredness is starkly evident in the novel's portrayal of the factory owners and managers, who are consumed by their quest for wealth and power. Their relentless pursuit of growth and expansion knows no bounds, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. The factory's imposing silhouette against the sky, with its towering chimneys spewing forth smoke and pollution, serves as a powerful metaphor for the devastating impact of their actions.\n\nAccording to Upton Sinclair's masterful depiction, the owners' disregard for the well-being of their employees is matched only by their disdain for the environment. The pollution and filth that pervade Packingtown are a testament to their callous disregard for the consequences of their actions. The workers, meanwhile, are nothing more than pawns in the owners' game of profit and greed, forced to toil in dehumanizing conditions with little regard for their safety or dignity.\n\nThe owners' treatment of their employees is a stark reminder of the exploitation that exists in the world. They'll stop at nothing to maximize profits, even if it means sacrificing the livelihoods of their workers. The speed and intensity of the production line, combined with the ever-present threat of layoffs and unemployment, creates a culture of fear and desperation. With little to no protection from the law, workers are forced to endure the harshest conditions, their lives reduced to a mere commodity to be exploited.\n\nWhile the novel doesn't explicitly state it, the workers in Packingtown are little more than modern-day slaves, their lives controlled by the whims of their oppressors. The lack of support systems, combined with the corrupting influence of unions that prey on the vulnerable, only serves to perpetuate the cycle of exploitation. The consequences of this system are dire, with immorality and despair becoming nearly inevitable outcomes for those trapped within its grasp.",
            "When authors aim to evoke a particular feeling or attitude in their readers, they often employ various techniques to achieve this goal. Some methods prove more effective than others, and F. Scott Fitzgerald skillfully employs a range of these techniques in his novel, The Great Gatsby. To create a specific ambiance around a subject, Fitzgerald pairs seemingly incongruous adjectives and nouns, while also attributing meaning to symbols and using them for the same purpose. He takes this latter approach with numerous colors, including gold, green, white, and red, weaving intricate meanings for these hues throughout the novel. \n\nIn The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald masterfully builds up the significance of colors, particularly white and red, then harnesses this meaning to elicit a particular emotional response in readers when applied to significant objects. When it comes to white/gray, Fitzgerald creates a sense of uniformity, with white representing a touch of elegance and refinement, while gray signifies age and faded grandeur. He sets the stage for this interpretation from the novel's outset, frequently using both colors in various contexts. For example, Daisy and Jordan are frequently \"in white,\" and everyone, including Nick, wears white attire at Gatsby's party - Tom dons a \"white shirt,\" and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white.\" Notably, the only time people are not dressed in white is when Nick is describing the impressions he formed of Gatsby's party, where the atmosphere is dominated by \"primary colors.\" Fitzgerald further solidifies the meaning of these colors by applying them to mundane, inconsequential subjects: as Nick navigates his daily routine, he walks through \"the white chasms of lower New York,\" and the names on his schedule become \"gray names.\" He also describes ordinary people or places as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy share a \"white girlhood,\" the valley of ashes is characterized by \"gray cars and gray land,\" and the dog-seller is a \"gray old man.\" \n\nAfter establishing the meaning of white/gray, Fitzgerald uses these colors to convey a sense of unimportance or uniformity to certain subjects, beginning with Daisy. After an extended period of relative absence, Fitzgerald reintroduces white as a descriptor for Daisy, depicting her dressed in \"a little white roadster,\" thereby reducing her in the reader's eyes from a fully fleshed-out character to a mere uniform ideal, something Gatsby covets and yearns for. This technique is also employed around Daisy, reinforcing the notion that she is a uniform addition, as seen in the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" and her appearance in a \"white\" dress prior to Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "The sun-kissed county of San Diego is a haven for agricultural productivity, with its idyllic climate yielding a bountiful harvest of delicious crops. Tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, and an array of herbs, tree fruits, and berries thrive in this Mediterranean haven. The demand for organic community-supported agriculture is also on the rise in the area, with numerous organizations experiencing lengthy waiting lists for their fresh produce. Locals can also indulge in organic eggs, milk, and honey, and many farms offer tours, allowing visitors to connect with nature and appreciate the beauty of the land.\n\nHowever, the benefits of organic farming come at a cost. The absence of chemicals in the soil and water leads to greater biodiversity in the area, but it also demands more labor and management to control pests and weeds, as well as to maintain soil fertility. Compared to conventional farming methods, organic farming often incurs higher losses and lacks the efficiency of larger operations. Moreover, small-scale organic farming requires more manual effort to implement beneficial practices like cover cropping, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and managing plant growth to create specific conditions for wildlife. As a result, landowners in this scenario may seek financial assistance or expert guidance to maximize their profits while preserving the land's ecological integrity.\n\nThe chosen property is a 160-acre tract of land adjacent to the charming town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California. This diverse landscape comprises chaparral, non-native grasslands, and oak woodlands, situated next to the Cleveland National Forest. The property falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which currently considers over a hundred species of flora and fauna, many of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the mountain yellow-legged frog.\n\nThis land has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries and later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 19th century. The property was originally part of a homestead patent, likely used for grazing and wood production over the years. To explore the possibilities for a small farmer in this area, I researched government programs and chose a model from a nearby organic farm in the same region.",
            "The intricate dance of culture plays a profound role in the delicate art of negotiation. But what exactly is culture? It's not a straightforward concept, as it's defined by both what it is and what it signifies. Culture is multifaceted, diverse, and far from uniform. Making broad statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" does more harm than good, oversimplifying the complexities of a culture. A more constructive approach is to grasp the significance of a culture to the negotiation at hand and how its values will influence the conversation. When interacting with a foreign culture, we inevitably compare it to our own, and a deeper understanding can be gained by studying its history, biases, and traditions.\n\nRather than judging or trying to change a culture, it's essential to accept it for what it is, working within its boundaries, especially during negotiations. This is particularly crucial when you find yourself in a weaker bargaining position. Similarly, when negotiating in unfamiliar territory, respecting local customs and traditions can help break down cultural barriers and facilitate progress.\n\nIt's also essential to recognize that culture doesn't solely exist within national or international contexts. Corporate cultures within a single nation can be vastly different, shaped by factors such as work hours, communication styles, and hiring practices. Take the varying corporate cultures within the United States, for example, which can differ significantly from company to company and even within the same company from one region to another. This diversity of thought within a societal culture is a reflection of the complex, multifaceted nature of human experience.\n\nUnderstanding values is equally crucial, as they reveal the underlying motivations and priorities of a culture. In cultures where saving face or communal harmony are valued, a negotiator is unlikely to publicly embarrass their company or superior to achieve success. Conversely, in cultures that prioritize a hard-driven bargain, negotiators may not be inclined to settle quickly. By considering these generalities before the negotiation, you'll be better equipped to navigate the complexities of cross-cultural communication. However, don't underestimate the importance of getting to know your opponent on a personal level – it's a key factor in effective negotiation.",
            "The phrase \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God'\" first appears in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and serves as the starting point for St. Anselm's argument on the existence of God. This notion also resonates with Thomas Aquinas, another influential thinker we'll be exploring. Since both authors aim to prove the same concept, we'll begin by assuming they're correct in their belief in a God-like entity, specifically the God of the Bible. Examining alternative, non-Biblical concepts of God would skew our comparison, as their arguments are fundamentally in defense of this particular notion of divinity. So, let's dive into their arguments, keeping in mind that each makes some compelling points, yet neither provides a comprehensive foundation for believing in God.\n\nTo illustrate this, let's start by dissecting St. Anselm's argument. Anselm's reasoning is centered around gaining understanding through faith, exploring the depths of one's own mind to find proof of God. He proposes that because God exists within our understanding, we can't conceive of his nonexistence. In essence, Anselm suggests that the proof for God lies within the confines of our own minds, and that we don't need external evidence to confirm his existence. This idea relies on the concept of faith, which, within Christian texts, refers to accepting truths without empirical proof. This line of thinking often raises eyebrows, as it seems to defy the need for concrete evidence.\n\nIn stark contrast, Thomas Aquinas takes a more cerebral approach. He argues that the existence of God can be proven solely through reason and empirical evidence, eliminating the need for faith altogether. This perspective would be particularly valuable in evangelism, a vital aspect of Christianity, as it would allow for the recruitment of new followers without relying on their willingness to accept the unproven. Instead, logic would be the driving force behind their conversion. Aquinas presents five logical arguments in support of God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each showcases the logical necessity for God's existence, demonstrating that we can deduce the existence of the missing piece (God) even when it's not directly visible, much like completing a puzzle.",
            "About 2500 years ago, in ancient times, a prince was born who would eventually be known as the Buddha. Throughout his life, he rejected worldly pursuits, achieved enlightenment, and his teachings gave rise to Buddhism. However, the faith has undergone significant changes over the centuries. This transformation is apparent in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed, a tradition that was never explicitly taught by the Buddha himself. These changes span from superficial customs to the very core of the faith, encompassing both the monastic and lay perspectives. The Theravada Buddhist community has had to adapt its core principles over time due to external and internal influences, both benevolent and malevolent.\n\nIn this discussion, certain terms will be used extensively. 'Internal force' refers to any change originating within the Buddhist community, while 'external force' denotes any influence from non-Buddhists. A 'hostile force' is any influence that seeks to harm or damage the Buddhist community, often stemming from a negative perception of Buddhism. Conversely, a 'benign force' does not intend to harm or help the community, though its outcomes may be unintentionally detrimental or beneficial.\n\nLet's delve into the fundamental principles of Theravada Buddhism, which form the bedrock of the faith. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is comprised of the Tripitaka, consisting of the Sutta Pitaka, Vinaya Pitaka, and Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Sutta Pitaka houses the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the monastic disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka deals with the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. These concepts include Anatta (no fixed self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these ideas is crucial to breaking free from Sansara, the cycle of birth and death, and eventually, attaining enlightenment, thereby ending lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka outlines rules for laymen, including the five precepts (non-harming, truthfulness, non-stealing, chastity, and abstinence from intoxicants), while monks adhere to numerous additional rules. The four noble truths, a fundamental Buddhist concept, state that life is marked by Dukkha, attachment causes suffering, and that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico - a tale of a 57-year rivalry that spanned the years from 1836 to 1893. It's a story of clashes, compromises, and a long, winding road to eventual understanding. The rivalry, which reached its peak in the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, was a defining moment in the history of both nations. The war saw the United States emerge victorious, claiming Texas and the American Southwest as its own. However, it wasn't the only confrontation between the two countries. There were many skirmishes, disputes, and standoffs that continued to simmer until just before the outbreak of World War I.\n\nAt the heart of the rivalry were fundamental disagreements over issues like faith, culture, and tradition. The two nations also had competing material interests, which often led to confrontations. This pattern is all too familiar in the world of international relations, where nations sharing a border often find themselves at odds over competing interests. The United States and Mexico are just one example of many long-standing rivalries that have shaped the complex web of relationships between nations.\n\nHistorians like David M. Pletcher have noted that the United States has had its fair share of diplomatic headaches over the years, particularly with Mexico and Cuba. These two countries, due to their proximity to the United States, have often found themselves at odds with American interests. In contrast, many other Latin American nations have enjoyed relatively smooth relations with the United States.\n\nReligious differences were another point of contention between the United States and Mexico. This was a trend that echoed throughout history, as nations have often been driven apart by fundamental disagreements over faith and governance. Sally Frahm observed that Americans have historically been wary of Catholicism and monarchy, just as they were opposed to fascism and communism in the 20th century. This ideological divide was deeply rooted in the distrust that existed between the English and Spanish empires, which in turn had a lasting impact on the relationship between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts documented 17 significant disputes between Mexico and the United States during this 57-year period, with most of them centering on territorial issues, border raids, and frontier problems. The issue of bandits and outlaws crossing the border was a recurring problem that only began to subside when both countries fortified their borders. As Schmitt pointed out, the rivalry between the two nations began to dissipate as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the United States, and American interests shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico.",
            "It's hard to believe it's been fifteen years since my life was turned upside down by a mysterious illness that I'd never even heard of. At the time, I was living my dream as a nurse, a career I'd chosen to escape the uncertainty of my own childhood. The mantra I'd heard over and over as I grew up was, \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\" So, I put my aspirations of becoming a scientist or journalist on the backburner and pursued nursing instead.\n\nFast forward to my 46th birthday, and I was faced with a harsh reality: I was struggling to make ends meet, with no savings to speak of, and unable to work due to my illness. Fifteen years later, I'm still living on Social Security Disability, and I've lost everything that was once mine. Every day is a grueling battle to maintain my security, safety, and self-respect. Yet, amidst the chaos, I've come to realize one invaluable truth: when disaster strikes, we all need a little help from our friends and family, no matter how strong we think we are. And trust me, when real disaster hits, strength is the last thing you feel like you possess.\n\nMy point is that life is unpredictable, and emergencies can lurk around every corner, big or small. No matter how well-prepared we think we are, some challenges are simply too big to tackle alone.\n\nI agree that we should be cautious about relying too heavily on government support, but I firmly believe that Americans would be better off learning to trust and help one another rather than turning to individualism as a solution. The idea of rugged individualism that our country was built on is a myth; it was actually the compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources of our forefathers that carried them through tough times. The pioneers who crossed the country in wagon trains didn't make it on their own; they had each other.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared – I've got my disaster kit and emergency supplies ready. I've got flashlights, first aid supplies, and a stash of canned goods, just in case. But while it's essential to be prepared, it's equally important to build a community that looks out for one another. Get to know your neighbors, and who knows, you might just find a lifeline when you need it most.",
            "Evolution's intricate dance - what drives it forward? Are there unseen forces that shape the course of change in the natural world? It's a question that has puzzled scientists for centuries, from D'Arcy Thompson's groundbreaking statements in 1917 to the present day. Despite the advances in mathematical modeling, the complexity of organic forms remains a mystery waiting to be unraveled. Recent studies, however, have applied mathematical modeling to the intricate processes of mollusk skeletogenesis, both during development and evolution (Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research delves into how mathematically modeling ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, combined with experimental studies, can shed light on the mechanisms behind evolutionary-developmental change.\n\nWe used high-tech X-ray images of Prunum species to quantify key parameters that can be used to model hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. These parameters were then fed into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995) to create a virtual framework for understanding the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. By combining these results with experimental and observational studies, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying forces that shape macroevolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a dynamic, three-dimensional structure that grows and changes over time, like a spiral that unwinds through 360 degrees of space. Each coil is called a whorl, which spirals around an imaginary central axis, or columella, that runs through the shell's central column. The rate at which whorls expand can vary, and the continuous lines separating each whorl are called sutures. In most shells, the last whorl, or body whorl, is the largest. The spire is the collective whorls excluding the last one, while the apex is the spire's tip and the base is the opposite end. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from different angles - apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural - with the \"classic\" view being the apertural perspective, where the aperture faces the viewer and the apex points upwards.\n\nTo count whorls, start by viewing the shell from the apical angle and mark where the first suture begins. Draw a line dividing the shell in two, then count the whorls from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures that traverse time and space as the animal builds its shell. By tracking the center of each whorl's aperture and its horizontal and vertical radius, we can map the shell's path through space and time. This trajectory can be represented graphically and mathematically, allowing us to manipulate the parameters and explore the mollusk's skeletogenesis in greater detail.",
            "We've all been watching Indonesia struggle to make headway in reducing neonatal and infant mortality rates over the past decade. Despite making strides in meeting some of the Millennium Development Goals, such as water and sanitation targets, the country has been woefully slow to improve child and maternal health. This plateau highlights the need to strengthen the overall health system rather than pinning our hopes on targeted programmatic interventions.\n\nThe statistics are telling. While 72% of births in Indonesia now involve a skilled health worker, this figure is somewhat misleading because it includes traditional workers like midwives who aren't equipped to handle complications. The consequence is a high number of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage. Moreover, the rate of diarrheal cases in children under five treated by a health professional has been on the decline. Unfortunately, data on postnatal care is incomplete, and what we do have suggests that this area is a major concern, with low rates across the country.\n\nCesarian-section rates are still disconcertingly low at 4% nationwide, but the disparity between urban and rural areas is even more striking. While 7% of urban births involve a C-section, this rate drops to an alarming 2% in rural areas. This stark contrast highlights the issue of unequal access to healthcare services, with urban areas reaping the lion's share of the benefits. Another pressing concern is vertical equity: there's a staggering 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles. This means the poor are struggling to access healthcare services, largely due to the financial burden of out-of-pocket costs.\n\nSo, what's the way forward? The fundamental question is how to effectively address the glaring lack of services. Should Indonesia focus on targeted programmatic approaches or strengthen the overall health system? While program-specific solutions may seem attractive, yielding faster results and more manageable objectives, they have their drawbacks. Investing heavily in one area can divert resources from other essential areas, drawing human resources towards the most funded sectors. Moreover, running multiple parallel programs can lead to duplication of services, uncoordinated between programs, resulting in increased paperwork and administrative burdens.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their meticulous attention to detail and their focus on the lives of the aristocracy of the time period. However, two works that deviate from this norm are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. Both novels incorporate elements of mystery and a touch of the bizarre, characteristics that were not typical of novels from the era. These unconventional features serve to strengthen the characters within each novel, offering valuable insights into their motivations and emotions.\n\nAs the characters navigated the chaotic world around them, their minds were flooded with a multitude of bewildering ideas. The lines between reality and fantasy began to blur, and it seemed as though they were trapped in a never-ending cycle of confusion. In Oliver Twist, for instance, the protagonist's inner turmoil is revealed through his dreamlike states and hallucinations. These strange visions offer a glimpse into Oliver's inner world, exposing his deepest fears and pains. The vivid description of the shooting in chapter 28 is a prime example of this. Oliver's reliving of the traumatic event is a stark reminder of the lack of control he had over his circumstances, and the devastating impact it had on his health.\n\nThe passage is a poignant portrayal of Oliver's emotional state, as he struggles to come to terms with the dire reality of his situation. His hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit serve as a constant reminder of the pain and fear that he endured. The \"unseen hand\" that swept him away is a powerful symbol of the overwhelming forces that controlled his life, leaving him feeling powerless and defeated. The passage implies that Oliver's experiences have broken him, rendering him incapable of taking control of his own life, even in the face of danger.\n\nIn a similar vein, the novel Wuthering Heights employs dreamlike sequences to reveal the inner workings of its characters' minds. The passage from Wuthering Heights describes a sense of time and space that is distorted and disjointed, reflecting the characters' emotional states. The day and night seem to blend together, creating a sense of timelessness and desperation. This portrayal of the characters' inner world serves to underscore their emotional turmoil and the sense of being trapped in a world beyond their control.",
            "A couple of years ago, I had the chance to work with elementary school students in an after-school program, where I tried to help them with their academic struggles, particularly in English and reading. However, I was approached by one of the instructors to assist a young boy named Adrian, who was in third or fourth grade. What struck me was that his reading difficulties didn't seem to follow the usual pattern. Some letters he could pronounce flawlessly, while others left him completely stumped. It was baffling, especially since he spoke perfect English. I had a hunch that his linguistic background might be the key, and I was right. His mother, who walked in on me while babysitting, only spoke Spanish, and I realized that Adrian's issue wasn't reading per se, but rather not knowing the English alphabet. This epiphany revealed to me how easily language barriers can masquerade as reading difficulties. I'm not sure how much it helped Adrian, but I hope he's made progress since then.\n\nI share this story to highlight the complexities of language barriers in schools, particularly in California, and to show that the issue isn't always as straightforward as we think. Even for children who speak perfect English, reading can still be a significant hurdle. It's clear that this problem exists, so what can we do about it? In Adrian's case, the solution was simple: targeted tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for children who barely speak English, the solution is far more intricate. There is no single answer. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, and ESL classes, each by itself, won't solve this problem. The key lies in combining these approaches.\n\nThe dual language system is an excellent concept that can benefit all children, not just those whose first language is Spanish. Research has shown that \"children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.\" Many people fear that such programs will waste resources and only benefit a minority of students, but this is a misconception. If implemented as the standard, rather than an exception, all children would benefit from these programs. So, how can we make this happen? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? That would be unrealistic and impractical. Instead, we can have bilingual aids, tutors, or support staff to help.",
            "We're often fed the notion that there's something greater than us, something we can't fully grasp since childhood. Some of us head to Sunday school, others to the temple, while many more turn inward in search of answers. Many of us simply accept the faiths passed down by our parents, but some of us reject them outright, convinced that there's nothing beyond our own understanding. We may adopt one value system only to later replace it with another. Ultimately, our journey is about defining ourselves through our unique perspectives on spirituality, seeking a guiding light in the darkness to lead us from the shadows into the light.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\nI remember a conversation with my dad, sitting on our porch as the rain poured down around us. We sat amidst the sound of raindrops pounding on the tin roof, surrounded by the dying plants along the edge of the porch. My dad's eyes were lost in thought, gazing out into the rain with a mix of introspection and reminiscence. He'd grown thinner and frailer over the past few months, his hair thinned out, and his clothes hung loosely on his frame. I sensed a deep sadness, a sense of unease, and a reluctance to confront the reality of his impending loss. I hugged him, sat back down, and joined him in staring out into the rain-soaked evening.\n\nMy dad passed away just five days after my twenty-second birthday in December. The chemo and radiation had prolonged his life by a few months, but it only prolonged his suffering. I couldn't help but wonder, what kind of higher power would do this? As I lay alone in the dark that night, I didn't say any prayers. If there was a God, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI chose not to watch my dad's final days. I couldn't bear to witness the life that created me slipping away. I wanted to remember my dad as he lived, not as he died. I knew him better than anyone else did, and I was certain he wouldn't have wanted me to be there for his passing. I curled up in a ball in bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nBut the phone never rang.",
            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" is a paradox in and of itself, as literary critic Ian Watt so aptly described it as an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New.'\" [The Rise of the Gothic Novel] The Gothic mode has been subject to a range of reactions, from scathing criticism to fervent praise, with some accusing it of lacking depth and others lauding its ability to evoke a sense of the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke).  Interestingly, the genre's birthplace can be attributed to Horace Walpole's 18th-century masterpiece, The Castle of Otranto, which successfully blended elements of both \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances to create a new literary form.  Walpole cleverly combined \"old\" theatrical elements with the \"new\" narrative style of modern novels to craft a story he dubbed \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre draws heavily from medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions, often incorporating them in a way that adds to its mystique. At the time of The Castle of Otranto's publication, the term \"gothic\" was already being used to describe various cultures, styles, and eras, often with a hint of nostalgia or even disdain for what was perceived as outdated or unsophisticated in the face of modern advancements. The union of the theatrical \"Gothic\" with the novel's innovative format, which allowed readers a more intimate glimpse into the characters' psychology, enabled the Gothic genre to endure for centuries, becoming both nostalgic and new to readers from different eras.\n\nOne of the most enduring Gothic ideas is the concept of Chivalry, which has its roots in medieval times. The original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto, explores this idea, adapting and transmuting it to create a sense of an idealized past. Chivalry, with its associations of bravery, honor, and competence, was crucial to Gothic writers like Walpole, who saw it as a lost ideal in their own time. Through the use of chivalric concepts and mannerisms, the \"gothic past\" becomes romanticized and idealized, hinting at the future evolution of Gothic into Romantic literature. As Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto during a tumultuous period in history, he may have believed that the supposed morality and goodness of the Gothic era had been lost in modern society. This sentiment is evident in the character of Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits, including being a prince, having suffered tragedy, and being described in a way that exaggerates traditional chivalric images. This character serves as a precursor to the Gothic trope of excess, which would become a hallmark of the genre (66).",
            "The concept of supply chain management has been evolving rapidly over the years, and I've seen firsthand the transformation of the way companies manage their goods movement from raw materials to the final customer. The term 'supply chain management' was coined in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant who recognized the importance of streamlining the process to meet customer demands efficiently. The entire supply chain process involves planning, implementing, and controlling various stages to ensure customer satisfaction. At its core, supply chain management is about orchestrating the six key elements: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information to provide exceptional customer service.\n\nProduction is where it all begins. It's the foundation upon which the entire supply chain is built. This stage involves outlining the when, why, where, and how of production, which requires managers to stay attuned to customer needs. By analyzing market trends, managers can gauge what customers are demanding and decide what products to produce, in what quantities, and where to produce them to meet customer expectations. The location for production is critical, as it affects volume and quality, so managers must weigh these factors carefully.\n\nOnce production is underway, managers focus on scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. Every detail is crucial, as any misstep can lead to costly delays and inefficiencies down the line. I've seen this firsthand in my retail days at places like Wal-Mart and Target, where even the smallest processes – from employee uniforms to receiving shipments – are meticulously planned and executed to ensure a seamless customer experience.\n\nThe next key element is supply, which involves strategic decisions about core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. Companies often have multiple divisions for a single product, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers must decide which division is best suited for each process and may choose to outsource work to other companies to boost velocity – the ability to deliver high-quality products while keeping costs low. By outsourcing, companies can tap into new capabilities and expertise, allowing them to stay competitive in the market.",
            "I was staring at a haunting message scrawled on a cardboard sign held aloft by Ellen Page, the talented actress from Juno. \"Hitler is alive in Burma,\" it read, the words etched with a Sharpie in bold, stark letters. I couldn't help but wonder about the tumultuous history of Burma, now known as Myanmar, a Southeast Asian nation ruled by a ruthless military junta that seized power in 1962 through a sudden coup. In 2007, a wave of protests erupted, led by courageous Burmese monks clad in their distinctive saffron robes. Dubbed the \"Saffron Revolution,\" these gatherings marked a rare moment of public defiance in a decade of silence. However, the government's initial hesitation to crack down was short-lived, and soon the violence escalated into a brutal conflict between the monks and the military, with troops invading and ransacking monasteries across the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned, with a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, tragically killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for witnessing a street protest. Estimates of the death toll varied, with some reports claiming as few as 13 fatalities, while Colonel Hla Win, a former army officer, whispered a chilling truth: \"Many more people have been killed in recent days than you've been told. There are thousands of bodies to count.\"\n\nThis is a story as old as civilization itself. Throughout history, governments have sought to suppress dissent and maintain complete control over their citizens. Ancient Roman emperors declared themselves divine rulers, while Japanese emperors were believed to be gods, sent to guide their people to prosperity – or so they claimed. Our own President George W. Bush allegedly held weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of the self-proclaimed Stupid People Worldwide, a group that seemed to be an offshoot of the Republican Party.\n\nThere have been countless examples of these power-hungry tactics. The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where students, intellectuals, and labor activists dared to challenge the Chinese government, resulted in a mysterious death toll that ranged from 200 to a staggering 3,000. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, backed by the Rwandan government, systematically slaughtered Tutsis and political moderates, was another egregious example. And then, of course, there's the infamous Holocaust, where Hitler's 'Third Reich' machinery rounded up and killed millions of Jews.",
            "The impact of Duke Ellington's legacy in jazz is largely due to his remarkable longevity and, by extension, his incredible ability to push the boundaries of his orchestra through his creative vision. While his piano playing is often understated in many of his compositions, as a composer Ellington excelled in crafting rich and complex pieces that showcased the unique talents of each band member. He skillfully designed the framework for soloists to improvise freely, as well as writing tightly orchestrated sections that highlighted the distinctive style of individual musicians, all while maintaining a cohesive tone for the entire orchestra. Through this approach, Ellington managed to create some of the most groundbreaking and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative use of voice as a jazz instrument, as seen in Creole Love Call, an early example of using voice to add texture and depth without the constraints of lyrics. This piece demonstrates Ellington's ability to complement the style of his soloists, a trait evident throughout his career. The 12-bar blues piece features six distinct choruses, including a call and response between voice and reeds, a muted trumpet solo, a sweeping clarinet solo, a full-band echo of the first chorus, a climactic reed-driven chorus, and a final chorus with a return to the call and response structure, where the voice takes on the sound of the \"growl\" technique. A brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant trombone ending rounds out the piece.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add a dimension of tone color is a stylistic trait that permeates his work. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year after Creole Love Call, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color, creating a rich and complementary sound through a call and response phrase between Bubber Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing. This technique is further explored in It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), where Ellington uses Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone. These examples showcase Ellington's mastery of creating innovative and harmonious sounds that bring out the best in his musicians.",
            "It's a nagging feeling that's been haunting her since she was 14. A yearning that refused to be satiated, growing stronger with each passing year. At 17, it was still there, gnawing at her insides. She'd initially thought it was a desire for something, but as the years went by, she realized it was actually a longing for someone. However, the people who had caught her attention just didn't seem to fit the bill. She found herself questioning this peculiar affliction, trying to pinpoint its source, but nothing seemed to stick. The years of contemplation had yielded a multitude of theories, yet none of them felt quite right.\n\nThose were usually the days when life was idyllic at home. Her parents were a tranquil couple who rarely argued with each other, and when they did, it was usually over her desire for independence and free-spirited nature. She, the free-spirited daughter of calm parents, brought a whirlwind of energy to the household. It was a dynamic that worked surprisingly well, and her likability made it easy for people to warm up to her.\n\nBut today was a different story. As she wandered through the house, searching for inspiration, the serene atmosphere was shattered by a blood-curdling scream from the kitchen. Her mother's voice, a melodious sound, was now laced with distress. Panic set in as she rushed to the kitchen, her mind racing with worst-case scenarios. \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" she exclaimed, dashing into the room. Her mother was on the ground, writhing in agony, her words barely above a whisper. \"Ow...sweetie, I...need you to take me to...the hospital.\" The desperation in her voice was palpable, and her daughter sprang into action. \"Okay, Mom, where can I pick you up?\" she asked, trying to keep her cool. Her mother's directions were fragmented, but her daughter was grateful for the classes that had honed her physical strength. She carefully lifted her mother and placed her in the car, driving her to the hospital with a sense of purpose.\n\nThe hospital's sterile scent and eerie atmosphere only added to the tension, but her daughter's focus was solely on her mother. She quickly ushered her into a treatment room, called out for medical help, and watched as the doctors and nurses swarmed in to attend to her mother's wounds. It turned out her mother had taken a tumble off a step stool while reaching for a vase on the top shelf of their kitchen cabinet. The worry etched on her face gave way to relief as the medical team sprang into action, and she waited anxiously for news about her mother's condition.",
            "A recent study shed light on the benefits of following the Mediterranean Diet, also known as the Med diet. The study found that women who adhered to this diet, as reflected by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" had a lower risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke. The aMed diet is a variation of the Med diet that emphasizes plant-based foods, such as fruits, nuts, whole grains, legumes, and fish, while reducing consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol intake is also allowed.\n\nPast research has consistently shown that a Med diet is associated with a reduced risk of total and heart-related mortality. In fact, one study found that the Med diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and improving cholesterol levels in obese individuals. However, previous studies did not focus specifically on the relationship between the Med diet and stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis new study, which followed 74,886 female nurses over a 20-year period, discovered a significant association between higher aMed diet scores and lower risks of CHD and stroke. The study used data from the Nurses' Health Study, a large cohort study that has been monitoring the health of 121,700 female nurses since 1984. The researchers computed the aMed diet score six times between 1984 and 2004, using self-reported food frequency questionnaires that assessed nutrient intake over the previous year. The study found that a high aMed diet score was associated with a 29% lower risk of CHD and a 29% lower risk of stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile.\n\nTo minimize random variation and better capture long-term dietary habits, the researchers averaged the aMed scores from multiple questionnaires. They also adjusted for various confounding factors, such as age, smoking status, body mass index, menopausal status, and physical activity. The study's findings suggest that following a Mediterranean-style diet may be an effective way to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke in women.",
            "We're still reeling from the aftermath of the 2007 financial crisis that ravaged the United States. The unemployment rate skyrocketed, the housing market imploded, and some of America's most influential corporations were left in shambles. So, let's face it – we're still wondering: how did this disaster unfold, and what can we do to prevent it from happening again? In a nutshell, the crisis was born from a toxic mix of self-serving and naive decision-making that forced banks and financial institutions to hand out sub-prime loans into a fragile financial ecosystem. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were strong-armed into underwriting and repackaging these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks found themselves woefully underfunded, and the chaos spilled over into the re-packaged mortgages they'd sold, ultimately infecting the entire economy.\n\nBut the seeds of this disaster were sown back in the late 1990s, when the Clinton administration was hell-bent on securing a second term in office. To bolster his popularity, they relaxed lending restrictions, creating a perfect storm for the sub-prime crisis that would unfold seven years later. In 1999, New York Times journalist Steven Holmes pointed out the impending doom: \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest mortgage underwriter, was under intense pressure from the Clinton administration to expand mortgage loans to low- and moderate-income households, all while satisfying shareholder demands for phenomenal growth in profits.\" Holmes astutely predicted the consequences of these actions: \"But the government-subsidized corporation might struggle in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As we now know, the results were catastrophic.\n\nA perfect storm of factors contributed to the economic meltdown, including the increasingly complex mortgage landscape. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) became ubiquitous in the years leading up to the crisis, entangling more sectors of the economy in the housing market. This created a housing bubble that left U.S. households and financial markets paper-thin, vulnerable to even the slightest price fluctuations.\n\nIn the end, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were left reeling. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, equivalent to about 30% of the USA's GDP. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at fire-sale prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subject to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were brought under government control in September 2008.",
            "The agony and ecstasy of exposition.  That pivotal moment in your story where you spread your wings and soar, leaving your readers in awe of your masterful prose - or, conversely, nodding off to sleep with a silent curse.  Dr. Merlin has been known to slam her monitor in frustration when she finds herself bogged down in Too Much Information, and not in the good kind of way.\n\nExposition: the nemesis that worms its way into every writer's narrative, begging to be told - and told in excruciating detail.  We've all heard the mantra, \"Show, don't tell,\" but even seasoned writers like Dr. Merlin still find themselves succumbing to the lure of lengthy passages that leave the reader wondering what's happening.  It's the inner voice that whispers, \"Get the backstory out of the way so we can get to the good stuff,\" but in truth, it's often the devil in disguise.\n\nExposition is the act of telling the reader what happened, in straightforward prose.  In film, it's the character's info dump, à la \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, it's the author's way of telling, not showing.  And let's face it, it's a slippery slope.  \n\nConsider this example: a heroine meets her beloved, gets married in a grand ceremony, and her husband is murdered before her eyes.  You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to unfold over two pages, with only two lines of dialogue from each character.  You'd want to see the husband's character shine through in his words and actions, and the heroine's growth and depth as she navigates their relationship.  A proper introduction to the husband would make his death all the more impactful, allowing you to mourn his loss alongside the heroine and deepen your connection to her.  In short, you'd crave substance, not just the bare-bones storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs writers, our task is to deliver that substance.  It's tempting to rush past the details, especially when introducing new characters, but resist the urge.  Don't settle for a superficial \"He used to be in the Air Force, now he's the night manager of a gas station, married twice, no kids, likes fishing on the weekends, dreams of owning the station, and loves Eggs Benedict.\"  Give your readers the richness they deserve - the meat on the bone of your story.",
            "I caught a couple of local news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio – NBC 4's morning newscast on August 13, 2011, being the first. The breaking story was about a man named Shad Hostettler, who'd stabbed his wife in Ashley, Ohio. His mug shot was flashed on screen, and let's just say he didn't exactly exude innocence. The news team barely scratched the surface of the incident, devoting only two minutes to the developing story. I thought that was a fair amount of airtime, considering the gravity of the situation.\n\nThe next story was about an 18-year-old named Travis Buyers, who was shot in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically injured and the police were still looking for leads. I noticed that this story seemed to receive relatively short shrift, which made me wonder if the neighborhood or the victim's ethnicity might have played a role in it getting less attention. I've long been struck by the way the media often glosses over stories involving minorities. When a white person is a victim, the media goes into overdrive, but when it's a minority, they get shortchanged.\n\nThe newscast then moved on to a story about a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. The authorities were tight-lipped about the investigation, but did reveal that a .22 caliber bullet had been fired from a rifle. A $5,000 reward was being offered for information that could lead to the shooter's capture.\n\nNext up was a story about the impending rain and thunderstorms forecast for Saturday afternoon. The weather report was brief, and I think that was intentional – the anchor was using it as a teaser to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nThe broadcast also covered a robbery at a UDF store on Clime Road. The perp was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie and a six-foot tall, 150-pound build. I found it interesting that the anchor emphasized the perpetrator's skin color and the color of his hoodie. It seemed like an unusual amount of time was spent on those details.\n\nAnother story was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin who'd been convicted of conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. I was puzzled by the way the anchor phrased his sentence – instead of saying 25 years in prison, they said 300 months. It wasn't clear what the point of that was. The anchor also mentioned Rodriguez's Hispanic heritage, but I'm not sure why that was relevant to the story.",
            "There's a bond between brothers that's impossible to break - a deep, unshakeable connection that weaves together a complex tapestry of emotions. Love, pride, jealousy, and the darker corners of cruelty all reside within this bond, creating a rich and multifaceted relationship that's both beautiful and brutal. Brothers have an uncanny understanding of one another, one that surpasses even the closest of friendships. When they look at each other, they see pieces of themselves, their own reflections staring back. It's in the darkest of times, when emotions run high, that the true nature of this bond is revealed, for better or for worse. With this bond comes a heavy price - the consequences of the emotions that fuel it. When we gaze into the eyes of a brother and see our own reflection staring back, we catch a glimpse of our true character, stripped bare of the facades we wear for the world. The choices we make and the actions we take are a testament to who we truly are.\n\nIn William Faulkner's \"The Sound and the Fury\" is not the correct text to be rewritten for the prompt, but instead, William Faulkner's short story \"The Old Man\" is not the correct text either. The story which is being rewritten is actually \"The Scarlet Ibis\" by Grant Wiggins. Through its vivid descriptions of a lush landscape, this tale of two brothers explores the intense emotions that come with this fraternal bond. In a heart-wrenching climax, bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride, and only one brother emerges unscathed. The author masterfully conveys the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist, Doodle, and his brother, as well as the narrator's observations, which serve as a powerful commentary on the true nature of their relationship. The protagonist's every move is driven by a single emotion: pride. From their early days together to their fateful final excursion, he harbors resentment towards his little brother, Doodle, who was born with a weak heart, making it impossible for him to participate in the adventurous life that his brother had envisioned. This crushing blow left the young protagonist reeling, his dreams of a playmate shattered in an instant. His anger towards Doodle is evident, as he even contemplates taking his life by suffocating him with a pillow - a chilling revelation that speaks to the darker corners of his heart. However, a simple smile from Doodle brings his brother's anger to the surface, revealing a glimmer of love and hope that had been lurking beneath. This moment of tenderness humanizes the protagonist, showing that his conviction was never as strong as he thought, and that love had always been present, even if it was hidden beneath the surface.",
            "It's no secret that the human brain is a complex, ever-evolving machine that processes information in ways both mysterious and miraculous. As technology has advanced from the Stone Age to the digital age, the metaphors used to describe our brains have evolved as well. Initially, our brain was likened to a piece of wax, then a scroll, then a book, and most recently, a supercomputer. While these analogies have served as a starting point for our understanding, it's essential to remember that they're limited and can lead us down the rabbit hole of misconceptions.\n\nSo, let's dive into the brain's inner workings. Information starts its journey as sensory input from our organs, which convert physical stimuli such as touch, heat, light, or sound waves into electrical signals. The brain then takes over, processing this info through a series of intricate algorithms that involve both bottom-up and top-down processing. Imagine looking at a picture of a black box on a white background. Bottom-up processing would break down the image into its basic components – color, orientation, and object borders – to conclude that you're seeing a box. Top-down processing, on the other hand, uses the decisions made earlier to speed up your recognition, perhaps identifying the object as a black box rather than a hole in the background.\n\nOnce the brain has processed the information to a certain degree, an attention filter kicks in, deciding which signals are most important and which cognitive processes to engage. Think of it like trying to find your name in a crowded room – your brain filters out the noise and zooms in on what matters. This attention filter is a crucial step in information processing, and it's a process that happens repeatedly throughout.\n\nFor the brain to process information effectively, it first needs to store it. We have different types of memory – sensory, working, and long-term – each with its own unique characteristics. The process begins with encoding, where information is transformed into a format that the brain can understand. For example, verbal input can be encoded based on its visual appearance, sound, or meaning. From there, the information needs to be maintained, and research suggests that working memory stores data for about 20 seconds by creating an electrical loop through a series of neurons. Long-term memory, on the other hand, is thought to be stored in the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are many theories about how knowledge is organized in the brain, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some are based on human behavior, others on computer science, and others on neurophysiology. One such model, the semantic network, proposes that our brain represents concepts as nodes linked by their relatedness. For instance, in this network, \"chair\" might be connected to \"table,\" which in turn is connected to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley's dystopian novel, Brave New World, serves as a scathing critique of the emerging technological and capitalistic structures of his time. In this fictional world, people prioritize community over individuality, and are conditioned from a young age to pursue instant gratification above all else. The citizens are mere pawns in a grand game, confined to a single ideology dictated by the all-powerful World Controller. Analyzing the novel through a Marxist lens reveals Huxley's underlying concerns about the developing systems. His use of Marxist terminology, such as homogeny and reification, underscores his suspicions about the flaws in the economy of his era.\n\nCapitalism is satirized through the concept of false consciousness, where the common citizen is kept in the dark about their true relationships with other classes in economic terms. Instead, they are preoccupied with their own selfish interests. This ideological control is evident in the conditioning of the population through hypnopædia, which strengthens their drive to consume, spend, and indulge above all else. The World Controller manipulates this conditioning, as we've seen, to maintain the status quo. Hegemony, the idea of groups being dominated by a separate, more powerful group, is a clear example of this in Brave New World. The working classes are blissfully unaware of their manipulation, essentially buying into an ideology that upholds the system (capitalism and consumerism). Meanwhile, the upper classes are aware of the manipulation but choose to do nothing, accepting their place in the hierarchy.\n\nIn Huxley's world, genuine relationships between individuals are few and far between. The characters, even major ones, lack depth and substance. One cannot help but wonder if Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together strips people of their free will and self-expression. Love and intense emotions are nonexistent; interactions are kept superficial, as seen in the males' shallow comments about women's physical appearance and the females' candid discussions of their encounters. Furthermore, the complacency of each social class in their position within the hierarchy reflects the socioeconomic effects of capitalism, where the proletariat is falsely convinced of their superiority as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform to their peers.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for roughly two and a half years now – four and a half semesters, give or take. For many of us, navigating the campus can be a real challenge. My first year in the East Halls dorm, nestled in the far reaches of campus, was a testament to this. The trek from my digs in Stuart Hall to places like the Willard building, near the heart of campus, often took up to 25 minutes on foot, especially when the unpredictable Penn State weather decided to make its presence known. I spoke with an alum not much older than myself, and it turned out that not too long ago, the East Halls dorms were effectively separated from the rest of the university by a vast expanse of unused land. Fast forward to today, and that empty space has been transformed into a thriving complex of sports fields, sleek new buildings, and trendy apartments, including the new Creamery and health services building. As our campus continues to expand, so do our transportation woes. What's the solution to this mobility conundrum? On a college campus, I firmly believe that the bicycle is the answer. However, a bike alone won't cut it; students need to hop on and the campus infrastructure needs to cater to cyclists' needs.\n\nI recently chatted with a friend who'd recently dusted off his bike after a few years away from it. He mused, \"Bikes are great – for a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Beyond being great exercise, bicycling is a highly efficient mode of transportation. A hearty bowl of oatmeal and a bit of physical exertion can take you 30 miles or more. As someone who now resides off campus, just as far from the heart of campus as some dorms, I made the smart move of investing in a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from my place. My trusty bike, on the other hand, can get me there in under 5 minutes, provided I pedal hard enough. The only catch is that Pollock Road is the most direct route to Thomas building, but it's not always the most bike-friendly road. I've found that walking has its merits, but I'm a busy bee and can't afford the extra time. Without my bike, walking would be my only reliable option, and it would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my day, devouring over two and a half hours every week. Factor in the time spent walking to and from other classes, appointments, and the like, and I'd be losing precious time I can ill afford to spare."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson.

Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",

As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "As I navigate my educational path in social work, I envision a career within the Division of Family and Children Services, dedicated to supporting children who've endured abuse or neglect. My goal is to provide a helping hand to troubled families, and in doing so, I aim to instill a sense of service, respect, and a commitment to fostering meaningful relationships. These core values aren't merely essential for social workers; they're deeply ingrained in my own personal philosophy.\n\nGrowing up, I've always felt an innate desire to aid others, yet I was uncertain about the career path that aligned with my passions. Throughout high school and college, I witnessed individuals escaping their problems through denial, while others employed coping mechanisms that didn't exactly inspire confidence. The situations I saw sparked a fire within me, and I decided to pursue a degree in Psychology. Even after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I still felt uncertain about my career path. That all changed one summer, when I visited a friend who was hosting a 16-year-old boy who'd fled his abusive home. I soon discovered that this young individual had reached out to the authorities for help. The next day, I accompanied the police to his parents' residence, where I shared my concerns and introduced myself as a recent Psychology graduate. The police asked me to speak with the parents, citing a lack of jurisdiction. When I questioned them about the situation, their nervous demeanor and excuses for their son's actions only solidified my resolve to pursue a career in social work, focusing on helping children navigate \"simple\" disputes within family dynamics.\n\nFor me, social justice is another crucial value in the field of social work. We often tout the importance of individuality, yet our society often pressures people to conform to archaic norms. I, on the other hand, relish being an individual and refuse to be bound by the need to fit in. Throughout my high school and college years, I made my stance against social injustices whenever I could: I dyed my hair unconventional colors, wore clothing that expressed my personality, got piercings that defied traditional standards, joined the GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and spoke out against racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it. Social justice is a cause I'm deeply passionate about, and I'll continue to advocate for it.",
            "I've dug into the complex world of insomnia, examining the biological and sociocultural models that attempt to grasp this elusive disorder. The biological model zeroes in on the genetic factors we inherit, as well as the medical aspects of health that influence our sleep patterns. On the other hand, the sociocultural model delves into the environmental factors, like our racial, ethnic, demographic, and socioeconomic backgrounds, which all play a significant role in our sleep habits.\n\nInsomnia can be categorized into three primary types: primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders linked to other mental health conditions, and those caused by medical issues or substance intake. The primary sleep disorders include Dyssonmias and Parasomnias. Dyssonmias encompass a range of difficulties, such as Primary Insomnia, where we struggle to fall asleep or stay asleep, and Primary Hypersomnia, which makes it hard to stay awake for extended periods. Narcolepsy, on the other hand, involves cataplexy and automatic REM sleep. Parasomnias, meanwhile, are sleep disorders associated with behavioral and physiological anomalies, like Nightmare Disorder and Sleepwalking Disorder.\n\nNow, let's dive into the biological model, which focuses on the genetic and physiological aspects of sleep disorders. Research has shown that neurons in the hypothalamus, specifically those containing orexin, play a crucial role in regulating our sleep-wake cycles. A study involving mice discovered that phenotypic GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons are responsible for sleep-wake states. When these receptors are activated, it promotes sleep, while their inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and increased sleepiness. The study found that a GABAB agonist, baclofen, increased sleep time in mice, suggesting that this genetic and environmental factor can also affect humans. This implies that a problem or absence of this receptor could disrupt our ability to sleep soundly without medication.\n\nThe sociocultural implications of this study are significant. If the GABAB receptor is inherited, it could play a crucial role in regulating our sleep patterns, and any alterations to this receptor could naturally disrupt our sleep, impacting various aspects of our lives, from school and career to daily tasks and focus. This highlights the complex interplay between our genetic makeup and environmental factors in shaping our sleep habits and overall well-being.",
            "I'm diving into the complex world of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD). It's time to break down the basics. To start, let's define CAPD: it's the way our brain processes what we hear. More specifically, it's a condition where the central nervous system (CNS) has trouble deciphering auditory information. This doesn't mean that someone with CAPD is hard of hearing; it's that the brain's ability to filter out background noise, separate words, and understand the sequence of sounds is impaired.\n\nAs I dug into the history of CAPD, I found that the concept of auditory imperception dates back to the 1950s. Researchers like Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for children with communication disorders back in 1954. The field continued to evolve, with Kimura introducing dichotic testing and a model to explain the brain's auditory processing in 1961. A 1977 national conference further sparked research on CAPD.\n\nPeople with CAPD struggle in various ways: they might have trouble pinpointing the source of a sound, distinguishing between multiple sounds, recognizing patterns, or picking up on subtle changes in speech. It's also common for one sound to be masked by another, making it difficult to interpret the sequence of auditory information. They might even struggle to synthesize sound clues, which can impact their ability to respond meaningfully.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD requires a systematic observation of listening behavior and performance on tests of auditory function. Audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other professionals use a range of measures to evaluate auditory-related skills. These might include questionnaires, surveys, and observations of how the individual responds to different stimuli. The challenge is that there's no single diagnostic tool that consistently yields accurate results, and the cause of CAPD remains unknown.\n\nTests often present the individual with multiple sounds simultaneously and ask them to differentiate specific items, such as words or numbers. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the brain's response to these signals.\n\nAs a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom, understanding CAPD can help you better support students with this condition. By being aware of the challenges they face, you can adapt your teaching methods to accommodate their unique needs.",
            "Twelfth Night appears to reveal a paradoxical truth: while adopting a disguise can be an effective means of deception, it ultimately requires a person to shed that facade, lest they lose themselves in the process. However, breaking free from a deception can come at a steep price – social isolation. This leaves the individual facing a difficult choice: protect their own identity or preserve relationships with those around them. The consequences of being discovered can be severe, ranging from indifference to outright offense.\n\nThe theme of deception through gender role reversal poses a particularly complex set of questions. Why do individuals feel compelled to abandon their true selves and assume an alternate identity? In Viola's case, her motivation is rooted in self-preservation: \"I'll take you to a trusted leader in this town, where I've found safety, thanks to the kindness of those who've helped me serve this noble count.\" (Act 5, Scene 1, lines 247-249) Having arrived in an unfamiliar land, Viola resorts to disguise to safeguard herself from potential threats. Her ruse succeeds, but it also isolates her from the women who could offer emotional support.\n\nViola's dual identity creates an added layer of complexity, as she's so convincing in her masculine guise that Olivia becomes infatuated with her, mistaking her for her twin brother, Sebastian. Furthermore, Viola struggles with repressed romantic feelings for Orsino: \"You've told me countless times that you'll never love a woman like me,\" (Act 5, Scene 1, lines 260-261) suggesting that deception can, in fact, facilitate the exposure of submerged emotions.\n\nWhile this may seem progressive by modern standards, Twelfth Night can be seen as a commentary on how deception can force individuals to confront their true desires. Certain passages hint that Olivia and Orsino may have unexplored feelings that are only revealed through Viola's disguise. Olivia's swift shift from romantic interest in Cesario to familial affection suggests that she may be parodying the societal norms of her time, judging people based on appearances rather than substance.",
            "The brutal nature of German colonial rule has been a topic of discussion among historians, particularly in regards to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, the German colonial empire was a complex entity with diverse policies and ruling styles, much like its varied geography. Education, too, was a patchwork across the colonies, with some receiving better support than others. When the British took over German East Africa in 1919, they found a population of educated and literate Africans, which stood in stark contrast to other colonies. The German colonial efforts in Kamerun and elsewhere were similarly praised by authors of the time.\n\nBut German South West Africa, now modern-day Namibia, was a different story altogether. Unlike East Africa, where the government invested heavily in state schools and education, South West Africa left the education of locals largely to missionary societies that operated on limited government funding. The government did, however, provide significant resources to educate Europeans in the colony, establishing state schools and heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. This approach had lasting effects on South West Africa, with its legacy continuing long after German rule. While other German colonies had significant numbers of educated Africans, in South West Africa, the majority of the population remained uneducated and illiterate. The divergent experiences of South West Africa were influenced by a complex array of social, political, and economic factors, which this paper aims to explore in more detail.\n\nExisting literature on education in the German colonial empire is vast and mostly written in German, with a focus on describing the colonial education systems during or shortly after the colonial period. Later works, written in English, expanded the discussion through comparative studies and in-depth analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted the significant differences between the educational systems of various German colonies, including a notable comparison between South West Africa and East Africa by Cohen. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa played a significant role in shaping the colony's educational system.\n\nThe climate of South West Africa, characterized by a moderately temperate climate with arid desert regions, attracted a relatively large European population. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, far outnumbering the European population in other colonies, such as East Africa, which had only 5,336 settlers.",
            "Fast forward to the past 100 years and the sheer explosion of popular music genres is staggering. It's a jungle out there, and with so many branches sprouting off the main tree, it's tough to keep track of them all. Sub-genres like death metal, grindcore, and power metal have sprouted from the likes of rock, country, jazz, and folk, each with their own unique offspring. I'd argue that heavy metal, in particular, has become the most dynamic and expressive genre of all, with a range of emotions that skew towards the darker side. It's as if the genre has an insatiable appetite for innovation, with artists pushing the boundaries and creating their own niches, which in turn give rise to even more sub-sub-genres.\n\nToday, heavy metal has evolved into a behemoth, with so many sub-niches that it's challenging to define what heavy metal even is. It's been shaped by influences from other genres, but its roots run deep. To truly understand the metal music that permeates our airwaves, we need to grasp the essence of the metal movement and why it's more than just a genre.\n\nAt its core, metal is a movement defined by its affinity for the darker side of life. It's the \"more\" that sets it apart – more bass, more volume, more aggression, more theatrics. It's a world where musicians are not just hobbyists, but masters of their craft, with chops that shine through in their music. And, if we're being honest, metal has a long history of being fueled by the excesses of the 1970s psychedelic drug culture. The resulting records were like nothing the world had ever heard before, with artists using their experiences with psychedelics as a catalyst for creativity. Heavy metal's visceral qualities were a breath of fresh air in an industry that had grown stale, and later generations drew inspiration from the Romantic Era's darker themes. Even the Beatles, with their iconic song Helter Skelter, experimented with the heavier side of the musical spectrum, paving the way for the likes of heavy metal.",
            "Decades before the Surrealists were painting their dreamlike masterpieces, Henri Rousseau was living his own surreal dream. His 1910 painting, The Dream, is a window into not only the woman in awe of the wonders of the land she visits within her dreams, but also Rousseau's own long-held aspirations and inner turmoil as an artist. For years, he yearned for recognition, validation, and admiration from his fellow artists and art enthusiasts, yet he found himself torn between conforming to the art world's expectations and forging his own path. This internal struggle defines The Dream, a work that encapsulates Rousseau's career-long conflict: should he play it safe by mimicking the styles of others or take a chance on being unique and staying true to himself?\n\nTo truly understand the significance of The Dream, it's essential to delve into Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in the quaint town of Laval in northwest France, Henri was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer who enjoyed a comfortable middle-class lifestyle. Growing up, he didn't receive formal art training; instead, he worked as a municipal toll collector, earning him the nickname douanier, or customs inspector. The loss of his first wife, Clémence, and eight of their infant children left Rousseau heartbroken and with only one daughter, Julia, to care for. Painting became his refuge, a way to escape the darkness and find solace. Unlike his contemporaries, who idealized and romanticized the peasant class, Rousseau was a folk painter, driven by the hopes and dreams of the common man.\n\nRousseau's desire for acceptance by the art world is understandable, given his late start and lack of formal training. He began his career at a time when many other talented artists were already making a name for themselves. It wasn't until around the same time that Matisse was establishing himself as a renowned artist that Rousseau finally started to gain recognition. As art historian Jan Gordon noted in Modern French Painters, Rousseau and Matisse were polar opposites, not only in style and subject matter but also in their motivations: while Matisse sought to create something original, Rousseau aimed to produce a work so conventional that it would earn him acceptance into the Artiste Français.",
            "Philosophers have long pondered the connection between ethics and aesthetics, suggesting that truth and beauty are intertwined. In my opinion, there's a fundamental reason for this relationship. As John Keats so eloquently put it in his poem \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty— / That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" We learn a lot in life through education and experience, but our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics seems to come from a deeper place. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe, rather than prescribe. When we study morality and beauty, we're really trying to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful or why an action is moral, rather than creating a set of rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nIn essence, criticism of art or morals can never fully capture the essence of what's good or beautiful. A discussion about the value of the Mona Lisa might focus on aspects like composition, contrast, or cultural context, but these don't actually explain why it's great art. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often say something like, \"There's just something about it\" before providing a more complex analysis. I believe that art and morals can't be reduced to a description of their qualities alone. As Flannery O'Connor once said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way...you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we describe a work of literature, there's always something more that can't be put into words.\n\nSimilarly, ethics has this transcendent quality. As Wittgenstein noted, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed / Ethics is transcendental.\" I propose that it's this \"something\" – this je ne sais quoi – that's the most powerful aspect of both art and morality, and that this transcendental nature provides a connection between them.\n\nI think morality and art are closely related because we experience both at a level that's hard to explain or fully grasp, what the philosopher Kant calls the \"noumenal.\" They impact us in a way that's both profound and ineffable. This connection is even stronger when it comes to literature. As McKean argues, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about literature, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself.\" After all, living necessarily involves values, and literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.",
            "Germany, the powerhouse of today, is a nation with a rich cultural tapestry woven from diverse threads that stretch from the shadow of the Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. The same unique cultural essence resonates from the banks of the Rhine River in Cologne to the heart of the country, and all the way to the historic city of Dresden on the Elbe River. It's no surprise, then, that modern-day Germany has a complex heritage, with its roots tracing back to various tribes and sources. \n\nThe origins of the name 'Germany' are shrouded in mystery, with scholars and historians hotly debating its etymology. According to ancient Roman historian Tacitus, the name might have come from the Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, who were previously referred to as Germans before crossing the Rhine and clashing with the Gaulish forces. However, Julius Caesar, who first used the term 'Germanus' in his Gallic Wars commentary, believed it was derived from the Gauls themselves. He used this term to distinguish between the Gauls he had conquered and those he had yet to subdue. While the true origins remain unclear, some speculate that it could refer to a neighboring tribe in the Gaulish language. In his Gaulic Wars account, Caesar notes that the Germans lived beyond the Rhine, constantly at odds with the Gauls in almost daily battles. Others propose that the name 'Germany' might be linked to the spear the tribes used in warfare, known as a 'ger', or the Old Irish word 'garim', meaning 'to shout', implying the Germans were known for their loud and boisterous nature. \n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus, writing in AD 98, penned an account of the Germans' origins in his work 'De Origine et situ Germanorum'. He described the Germans as an indigenous people, untouched by external influences, who arrived by ship rather than land. He quipped that who would knowingly leave sunny Italy for Germany's harsh climate, rugged terrain, and gruff demeanor? It's unlikely the Romans would venture into Germania, at least not yet. They would send expeditions to trade and lead occasional military campaigns but ultimately return to their vast empire. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they lived on the fringes of the Roman Empire, trading their goods and skills to Roman soldiers. This complex history laid the groundwork for the modern Germany we know today.",
            "As I stood there, my gaze drifted down, my mind a complete blank.  I stared at the scene before me, my thoughts drifting in and out without leaving any lasting impression.  My mind was a smooth, efficient machine, processing the visual information in front of me without any emotional resonance.  Ideas danced across my mind, only to vanish as quickly as they appeared.\n\nI'd picked up an art instruction book, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,\" after taking advice from a fellow artist I worked with.  I'd always been fascinated by drawing, ever since I was a six-year-old, and this book promised to teach me the fundamentals, from understanding the humble pencil to the brain's process of interpreting lines.  One technique it taught was to frame a picture with a square, simplifying the complex into something easily graspable – like that bowl of fruit on the table, now just a simple, two-dimensional shape.\n\nAs I gazed at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't mentally impose that frame.  I was overwhelmed, awestruck – and all I could do was stand there, mesmerized.  Great artists like Picasso and Monet had their own signatures – blue and green, respectively – and the Italian Renaissance masters splashed across the spectrum.  If I wanted to call myself an artist, this bowl was where my story began, my Work in Brown.\n\nMy hand hesitated above the drawing tool, then moved down, my fingers making contact with the paper.  My mind's creative energy surged, as it had only a few moments before, when I'd raised the toilet plunger to tackle the clogged commode.  Water swirled, smooth and serene, but this time I was after something more tangible – a stubborn brown mass that refused to budge, stuck to the toilet like a slug on a cold surface.  I gripped the mop loosely, my feet shoulder-width apart, my tie constricting my neck.  A frown creased my face as I glared at the offending package, a messy bundle of processed food and waste, a message left for the maintenance crew at Rite Aid.  More flushes, a few more contemplative moments, and my hand reached for the toilet paper, mummifying itself into a makeshift shield.  Then, with a measured movement, I dipped my hand into the bowl, like a cook preparing a Thanksgiving turkey for the oven.",
            "Thanks to the National Institutes of Health, we've had a glimpse of the grim reality behind the wheel. Teenagers are dying in alarming numbers, and the statistics are a stark reminder of the deadly vectors that converge to create this crisis. It's a perfect storm of factors, and one of the most striking is the simple truth that the teen brain just isn't equipped to handle the perils of driving. Inexperience is another major culprit, leading not only to a higher number of fatal accidents but also a greater likelihood of vehicle rollover, speeding, and veering off the road. \n\nAdding to the problem is the notion that teens tend to fare worse when cruising with their peers – a scenario that's all too common. A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center revealed a disturbing correlation between passenger age and traffic accidents. It's a phenomenon that's as predictable as it is heartbreaking.\n\nIn response, California and other states have implemented provisional licenses to curb the carnage. These temporary permits limit driving hours and ban other minors as passengers, but I believe they're little more than a Band-Aid on a gaping wound. The real issue is that, by all statistical markers, the youngest drivers are simply not equipped to handle the risks and responsibilities that come with getting behind the wheel. Even psychologist Marvin Zuckerman thinks 18 is too young for a full driver's license, citing research that suggests a common desire among those under 19 or 20 to take risks for the thrill of it. It's a pattern that's hard to ignore, and one that makes a strong case for delaying driving until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to subside.\n\nIf we continue to issue driver's licenses to young teens, we'll see more and more deadly accidents – and the death toll will keep rising. By 2010, the Baby Boomer's children will be hitting the road in droves, and the consequences will be catastrophic. It's time for a more proactive approach, one that involves legislation to address this growing crisis.\n\nA reasonable solution would be to make driver's education classes a staple of high school curricula, but with one key caveat: no one under 18 should be allowed to get behind the wheel. A provisional permit could still be issued, but only after completing a certain number of practical driver's training hours – say, the 6 hours and 50 hours of practice already required in California. Uniform national legislation would be a powerful tool in protecting teens across the country, and it's an idea that's not exactly new. So, let's get behind it and make our roads safer for everyone.",
            "I recently spent hours browsing the Library of Congress's vast collection of early Edison films, but I zeroed in on the trick films from 1895 to 1901. There were fifteen of them, and I was determined to watch them all. These films relied heavily on creative editing to create illusions that would leave viewers mesmerized. As I delved deeper into the world of trick films, I found myself fascinated by the poetics behind most of them and the evolutionary characteristics that began to emerge in a few of the later ones. The majority of trick films from the turn of the century are static, confined to a frontal proscenium, and stick to a rigid one shot equals one film approach. They feature long and medium shots, with no camera movement to speak of. However, as we move into the early twentieth century, a few trailblazers dare to break free from these conventions by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nOne of the most striking commonalities among these trick films is the use of an interior set within a frontal proscenium frame. The camera remains stationary, never deviating from its position to follow characters or objects. This composition draws its roots from the theater and, in the case of trick films, vaudeville and magic shows. The limitations of this approach are evident in the way characters usually move side-to-side, never walking towards or away from the camera. Take, for instance, the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis, never straying from this pattern.\n\nThe use of a frontal proscenium also means that shots tend to be long and, occasionally, medium shots. Close-ups are a rarity in these trick films from the Edison catalog, a nod to the theater and vaudeville tradition where the audience sees the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in many early films, actors rarely move towards the camera, making close-ups a distant memory.\n\nMost early trick films adhere to the rule that one conceptual shot equals one film. This limits their length to around a minute or less, depending on the frame rate used. As a result, these films typically focus on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing acts, and quick switches, with little narrative or dramatic depth. However, upon closer inspection, you'll notice that what appears to be one conceptual shot can actually be several joined together to create a seamless illusion. Take, for example, The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), an early trick film that reveals a clever editing trick when you look closely.",
            "The name John Taylor of Caroline was synonymous with unwavering dedication to the principles of Republicanism. As an agriculturalist by trade and a brief stint in politics, he left an indelible mark on the discourse around personal freedom and government. His passion for an agrarian lifestyle served as the foundation for his opinions on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the judicial system. His stance was firmly rooted in his desire to preserve and promote what he deemed the most noble of all professions.\n\nTaylor believed the United States had a unique opportunity to craft an ideal system, unencumbered by traditional constraints that often hindered the development of new societies. This blank slate allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government that he passionately advocated for. He firmly believed in the inherent rights of individuals, which he saw as interconnected – when one right was compromised, the value of the others diminished. As such, these rights should be shielded from government interference. In his view, the concept of the 'state of nature' implied that those with physical strength and cunning would thrive, but in a civilized society, this shouldn't be the case.\n\nTo create an ideal society, Taylor believed a government must be designed to account for the duality of human nature – both good and evil. He rigidly adhered to a dualistic morality, arguing that as government is exercised by humans, it will inevitably reflect both virtues and vices. He defined good principles as those that protect private property, promote agriculture, and discourage the excesses of capitalism. Taylor firmly believed that a government founded on these principles would function equitably, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by avarice and self-interest. However, he noted that self-interest, though a fundamental aspect of human nature, only became problematic when it led to the creation of sub-societies that exploited others.\n\nTaylor, like many of his fellow Republicans, advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution. He envisioned a limited Federal government with only the powers explicitly stated in the Constitution, recognizing that an extensive Federal government would be expensive and prone to despotism. However, he also believed that a literal interpretation of the Constitution without considering the intent of its writers could lead to corruption. Furthermore, he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it more explicitly described the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Looking back at the data, it's clear that there was a drastic drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of our project. That was a bit disheartening, and pinpointing the cause is a challenge. It's not hard to imagine that the onset of a New England winter would lead to fewer cyclists and pedestrians commuting to campus, which could account for part of the decline. With the end of the fall semester in December comes a busy time for students and faculty, finishing up schoolwork, processing grades, and gearing up for the holiday season. It's likely that filling out the commuter log got buried under the hectic pace of the time. And then there's the month-long break that accompanies the holiday season, during which many students and faculty hardly set foot on campus. Classes resume in late January, which might explain the low number of logs for that month, too. But the low numbers in February remain a puzzle.\n\nOne possible explanation is that any project of this type tends to experience a natural ebb in enthusiasm and energy at the outset, followed by a gradual decline. To combat this trend, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week, a special campaign in March to reignite the initiative, which indeed led to an uptick in log submissions that month. This highlights one of the challenges we faced: maintaining project momentum in the face of natural fluctuations and the specific hurdles of the academic calendar.\n\nAnother hurdle we encountered is the deeply ingrained cultural preference for driving one's own car, which provides a sense of freedom, independence, and flexibility. To encourage alternative modes of commuting, we offered incentives in the form of gift certificates to local businesses like restaurants, coffee shops, and the local independent bookstore. It would have been interesting to see how larger prizes might have affected participation – think a brand-new bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have helped combat that decline in engagement we experienced. The prizes remained the same throughout the project, but if we had announced bigger and better prizes as the project progressed – say, adding a couple of bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January – it's likely that participation and engagement would have increased instead of decreased.",
            "The exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a game-changer in the world of investments. Imagine having the diversification of a mutual fund and the agility of individual stock trading all wrapped up in one convenient package. That's essentially what an ETF offers. You get the best of both worlds - the stability of a broad-based index fund and the flexibility to buy and sell as you please, even shorting or trading on margin. And the icing on the cake? ETFs come with significantly lower expense ratios compared to the average mutual fund.\n\nOf course, there are some downsides to consider. Trading ETFs involves paying a commission, just like you would with individual stocks. But the benefits far outweigh the costs. With a staggering array of funds to choose from, you can pick and choose the ones that fit your investment goals and risk tolerance. So, what's the best way to evaluate an ETF? A savvy investor would do well to dig deeper and assess whether the touted benefits, like diversification, really deliver. For the sake of this exercise, we'll be taking a closer look at the ETF IHF and its top 10 holdings to see whether owning a single ETF can match the benefits of a diversified portfolio of individual stocks.\n\nTo keep things manageable, we're focusing on the top 10 holdings, which account for a whopping 63.58% of the ETF's assets. Here they are, along with their respective percentages. We'll use these holdings to estimate how well they represent the ETF as a whole. By normalizing their assets to 100%, we can calculate their individual contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return, as if the portfolio consisted solely of these 10 stocks in the same proportions as the ETF.\n\nThe chart reveals an interesting finding: a portfolio consisting only of the top 10 holdings would yield a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, a 16% boost in returns. Furthermore, the Beta of this portfolio is 0.12 lower than the ETF's. This suggests that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings might offer higher returns with lower risk. But are these findings statistically significant? To find out, we'll examine the standard deviation of each of these top 10 stocks, normalized to 100%, and compare them to the ETF's accumulated standard deviation.",
            "In the realm of poetry, Edgar Allan Poe's \"Dream-Land\" stands out as one of his masterpieces. The term \"Thulé\" pops up twice in this poem, lines 6 and 56, a nod to the ancient world that Poe was deeply familiar with. In fact, \"Thulé\" has its roots in Virgil's time, referring to an island north of Britain that the Greeks believed marked the edge of the known world. While Virgil did indeed use the term, there's another source that deserves credit - Poe's fascination with German literature, particularly the works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.\n\nThis tidbit is significant because it reveals Poe's admiration for Goethe's writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" points out the striking similarities between their poems, suggesting that Poe was, in fact, inspired by Goethe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature notes that Goethe was a celebrated poet, best known for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" which was published in two parts - the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe's passing. Within \"Faust's\" second part lies a haunting poem called \"The King of Thulé,\" which tells the story of a king whose wife dies, leaving him heartbroken and lost in grief. He spends his days drinking and crying, eventually giving up his kingdom and life, casting his belongings into the ocean. The king's tale bears an uncanny resemblance to the protagonist in \"Dream-Land,\" who finds himself lost in a dark, lonely world, haunted by memories of loved ones and a world devoid of color.\n\nPoe references Thule twice in his writings, using the phrase \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and \"Dream-Land\" as bookends. These two poems can be seen as companion pieces, with \"The King of Thulé\" serving as a precursor to \"Dream-Land.\" In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a desolate landscape, where shadows loom large and color is absent, a world that eerily mirrors Goethe's \"The King of Thulé,\" where the king's loss of his wife has left him a hollow shell of his former self. Given Poe's admiration for Alfred Tennyson, it's likely that he was familiar with Goethe's work through various reproductions and adaptations that were circulating after the original publication.",
            "In the Golden State of California, if a shopper gets hurt after slipping on an applesauce spill at the grocery store and then sues the store for punitive damages, can they succeed if they prove the store manager acted with malice? The manager, Paul Martin, was told about the spill twice - once by Rich Wayne at 5:00 pm and again by Mary J. Haddigan at 5:15 pm - but chose to keep eating dinner instead of having it cleaned up by 5:30 pm. So, did Martin show a \"willful and conscious disregard\" for the potential harm caused by the spill? To get punitive damages, the shopper, Jennifer Palmer, will need to show that Martin knew the spill could cause harm because multiple customers had fallen in the same spot before her accident. Palmer may argue that Martin was deliberately ignoring the safety of his customers by not cleaning up the spill, especially considering six slip-and-fall incidents happened at D&D Markets in 2009. While this argument might not be a slam dunk, it's still a reasonable claim given the evidence. \n\nLet's take a closer look at what happened. On October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne told Martin about the applesauce spill, and Martin basically said he was too busy eating dinner to care. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also informed Martin about the spill, and he responded with the same attitude. It's no coincidence that Palmer slipped and fell on the spill at 5:30 pm, and it's no surprise that she's now suing D&D Markets for compensation and punitive damages. The question is whether Palmer has a strong enough case to win punitive damages. In California, a person can receive punitive damages if the other party acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" The law defines malice as either intending to cause harm or being downright despicable and recklessly disregarding the rights or safety of others. \n\nSo, will the court dismiss Palmer's case or let it move forward? To determine this, we need to look at whether Martin's actions were malicious. According to the law, conduct is malicious if it's a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights when the defendant knows the probable harm of their actions and chooses to ignore it. In this case, Martin was aware of the potential danger of the spill because several customers had already fallen in the same area, and he still chose to do nothing. This is why Palmer's lawyer will likely argue that Martin's actions were despicable and warrant punitive damages.",
            "Almost four years ago, I took a course in Islam at CBC, where one of the most heated debates in class centered around whether Islam is a hostile religion. This question seems even more pertinent today than ever before. Looking back on the years since 9/11, I've noticed that mass media has swung from a hostile view of Islam to an extreme level of tolerance in America. We've come a long way, and it's hard to imagine that in 2001, we wouldn't have seen a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, who has an openly acknowledged Muslim background in his family.\n\nThe Biography of the Prophet has been a fascinating study for me, as it reveals a Muhammad that contradicts what I previously thought. What I knew of Muhammad's history suggested he was a forceful leader who forced conversions to Islam, conquering tribes and imposing his faith on them. However, the biography portrays Muhammad as a humble, misunderstood, and even self-effacing martyr, who attracted followers one by one through the truth of his teachings.\n\nSome striking similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the miracles attributed to Muhammad have also caught my attention. One such example is when Muhammad multiplied mutton and milk to feed forty men, much like the miracle stories associated with Jesus. I suspect that the writers aimed to present Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove himself, but lived in truth and performed miracles. This approach, in my view, diminishes the significance of Jesus' life and miracles, much like taking credit for someone else's achievements.\n\nFurthermore, the biography seems to be driven by an agenda to provide evidence of witness and spontaneous conversions to Islam, with many stories presented through third-party accounts. This makes me skeptical, as it diminishes the authenticity of the stories and implies a level of fabrication. It's as if they're trying to create a narrative that undermines the integrity of the original accounts.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this work is the attempt to portray Muhammad as a godly figure, humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. History, however, suggests that Muhammad's rise to power was far from gentle, and I wonder if today's Muslims are aware of the true complexities behind their prophet's story.",
            "The teachings of Jesus and the core beliefs he held during his life were quickly lost in the sands of time as Christianity evolved after his passing. When we view this history from a broad perspective, we notice a trend of Christianity drifting further and further away from its roots. Today, we're witnessing a growing awareness and an unprecedented shift towards progress. While traditionalists cling to the status quo and resist any departure from established dogma, this segment of the population may not hold enough sway to shape the entire narrative. As time progresses, a growing awareness of Christian history will emerge, and a yearning will develop to distinguish the doctrines that have been added to Christianity over the centuries from the original intent of the faith's namesake. It may take decades or even centuries, but the inevitable outcome will be a reversal of the trend in Christian history. The movement will slowly but surely peel back the layers of doctrine, reversing the clock as it were, until only the fundamental principles introduced by Jesus on behalf of God remain. When this shift sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing the masses, the church as an institution will continue to thrive, but its teachings will become more uniform and less diverse. Regions, denominations, and divisions will begin to resemble each other more closely, rather than showcasing their differences. History is replete with examples of such reversions – consider how the Roman Empire once persecuted Christians, only to later become a bastion of Christianity, or how the United States transitioned from slavery to African-American leadership. The great reversion that's on the horizon will play out in the realm of the Christian faith, as we seek to return to the source and, in the process, shed our diversity. A crucial aspect of this journey will be reinterpreting Jesus' words as metaphors rather than literal statements. So, what's changed since Jesus' time?\n\nLooking back through the mists of history, we find that the only existing faith was Judaism, the theological foundation of the Christian religion. By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were established at the core of this faith. However, the Jewish population was not a monolith; they divided into the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common people, each with their own distinct perspectives.",
            "The Jungle is a thought-provoking novel that forces us to confront the harsh realities of human nature. Beneath the surface, we're all driven by our own self-interest, prioritizing our own desires above the needs of others. This self-centeredness is starkly evident in the novel's portrayal of the factory owners and managers, who are consumed by their quest for wealth and power. Their relentless pursuit of growth and expansion knows no bounds, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. The factory's imposing silhouette against the sky, with its towering chimneys spewing forth smoke and pollution, serves as a powerful metaphor for the devastating impact of their actions.\n\nAccording to Upton Sinclair's masterful depiction, the owners' disregard for the well-being of their employees is matched only by their disdain for the environment. The pollution and filth that pervade Packingtown are a testament to their callous disregard for the consequences of their actions. The workers, meanwhile, are nothing more than pawns in the owners' game of profit and greed, forced to toil in dehumanizing conditions with little regard for their safety or dignity.\n\nThe owners' treatment of their employees is a stark reminder of the exploitation that exists in the world. They'll stop at nothing to maximize profits, even if it means sacrificing the livelihoods of their workers. The speed and intensity of the production line, combined with the ever-present threat of layoffs and unemployment, creates a culture of fear and desperation. With little to no protection from the law, workers are forced to endure the harshest conditions, their lives reduced to a mere commodity to be exploited.\n\nWhile the novel doesn't explicitly state it, the workers in Packingtown are little more than modern-day slaves, their lives controlled by the whims of their oppressors. The lack of support systems, combined with the corrupting influence of unions that prey on the vulnerable, only serves to perpetuate the cycle of exploitation. The consequences of this system are dire, with immorality and despair becoming nearly inevitable outcomes for those trapped within its grasp.",
            "When authors aim to evoke a particular feeling or attitude in their readers, they often employ various techniques to achieve this goal. Some methods prove more effective than others, and F. Scott Fitzgerald skillfully employs a range of these techniques in his novel, The Great Gatsby. To create a specific ambiance around a subject, Fitzgerald pairs seemingly incongruous adjectives and nouns, while also attributing meaning to symbols and using them for the same purpose. He takes this latter approach with numerous colors, including gold, green, white, and red, weaving intricate meanings for these hues throughout the novel. \n\nIn The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald masterfully builds up the significance of colors, particularly white and red, then harnesses this meaning to elicit a particular emotional response in readers when applied to significant objects. When it comes to white/gray, Fitzgerald creates a sense of uniformity, with white representing a touch of elegance and refinement, while gray signifies age and faded grandeur. He sets the stage for this interpretation from the novel's outset, frequently using both colors in various contexts. For example, Daisy and Jordan are frequently \"in white,\" and everyone, including Nick, wears white attire at Gatsby's party - Tom dons a \"white shirt,\" and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white.\" Notably, the only time people are not dressed in white is when Nick is describing the impressions he formed of Gatsby's party, where the atmosphere is dominated by \"primary colors.\" Fitzgerald further solidifies the meaning of these colors by applying them to mundane, inconsequential subjects: as Nick navigates his daily routine, he walks through \"the white chasms of lower New York,\" and the names on his schedule become \"gray names.\" He also describes ordinary people or places as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy share a \"white girlhood,\" the valley of ashes is characterized by \"gray cars and gray land,\" and the dog-seller is a \"gray old man.\" \n\nAfter establishing the meaning of white/gray, Fitzgerald uses these colors to convey a sense of unimportance or uniformity to certain subjects, beginning with Daisy. After an extended period of relative absence, Fitzgerald reintroduces white as a descriptor for Daisy, depicting her dressed in \"a little white roadster,\" thereby reducing her in the reader's eyes from a fully fleshed-out character to a mere uniform ideal, something Gatsby covets and yearns for. This technique is also employed around Daisy, reinforcing the notion that she is a uniform addition, as seen in the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" and her appearance in a \"white\" dress prior to Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "The sun-kissed county of San Diego is a haven for agricultural productivity, with its idyllic climate yielding a bountiful harvest of delicious crops. Tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, and an array of herbs, tree fruits, and berries thrive in this Mediterranean haven. The demand for organic community-supported agriculture is also on the rise in the area, with numerous organizations experiencing lengthy waiting lists for their fresh produce. Locals can also indulge in organic eggs, milk, and honey, and many farms offer tours, allowing visitors to connect with nature and appreciate the beauty of the land.\n\nHowever, the benefits of organic farming come at a cost. The absence of chemicals in the soil and water leads to greater biodiversity in the area, but it also demands more labor and management to control pests and weeds, as well as to maintain soil fertility. Compared to conventional farming methods, organic farming often incurs higher losses and lacks the efficiency of larger operations. Moreover, small-scale organic farming requires more manual effort to implement beneficial practices like cover cropping, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and managing plant growth to create specific conditions for wildlife. As a result, landowners in this scenario may seek financial assistance or expert guidance to maximize their profits while preserving the land's ecological integrity.\n\nThe chosen property is a 160-acre tract of land adjacent to the charming town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California. This diverse landscape comprises chaparral, non-native grasslands, and oak woodlands, situated next to the Cleveland National Forest. The property falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which currently considers over a hundred species of flora and fauna, many of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the mountain yellow-legged frog.\n\nThis land has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries and later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 19th century. The property was originally part of a homestead patent, likely used for grazing and wood production over the years. To explore the possibilities for a small farmer in this area, I researched government programs and chose a model from a nearby organic farm in the same region.",
            "The intricate dance of culture plays a profound role in the delicate art of negotiation. But what exactly is culture? It's not a straightforward concept, as it's defined by both what it is and what it signifies. Culture is multifaceted, diverse, and far from uniform. Making broad statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" does more harm than good, oversimplifying the complexities of a culture. A more constructive approach is to grasp the significance of a culture to the negotiation at hand and how its values will influence the conversation. When interacting with a foreign culture, we inevitably compare it to our own, and a deeper understanding can be gained by studying its history, biases, and traditions.\n\nRather than judging or trying to change a culture, it's essential to accept it for what it is, working within its boundaries, especially during negotiations. This is particularly crucial when you find yourself in a weaker bargaining position. Similarly, when negotiating in unfamiliar territory, respecting local customs and traditions can help break down cultural barriers and facilitate progress.\n\nIt's also essential to recognize that culture doesn't solely exist within national or international contexts. Corporate cultures within a single nation can be vastly different, shaped by factors such as work hours, communication styles, and hiring practices. Take the varying corporate cultures within the United States, for example, which can differ significantly from company to company and even within the same company from one region to another. This diversity of thought within a societal culture is a reflection of the complex, multifaceted nature of human experience.\n\nUnderstanding values is equally crucial, as they reveal the underlying motivations and priorities of a culture. In cultures where saving face or communal harmony are valued, a negotiator is unlikely to publicly embarrass their company or superior to achieve success. Conversely, in cultures that prioritize a hard-driven bargain, negotiators may not be inclined to settle quickly. By considering these generalities before the negotiation, you'll be better equipped to navigate the complexities of cross-cultural communication. However, don't underestimate the importance of getting to know your opponent on a personal level – it's a key factor in effective negotiation.",
            "The phrase \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God'\" first appears in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and serves as the starting point for St. Anselm's argument on the existence of God. This notion also resonates with Thomas Aquinas, another influential thinker we'll be exploring. Since both authors aim to prove the same concept, we'll begin by assuming they're correct in their belief in a God-like entity, specifically the God of the Bible. Examining alternative, non-Biblical concepts of God would skew our comparison, as their arguments are fundamentally in defense of this particular notion of divinity. So, let's dive into their arguments, keeping in mind that each makes some compelling points, yet neither provides a comprehensive foundation for believing in God.\n\nTo illustrate this, let's start by dissecting St. Anselm's argument. Anselm's reasoning is centered around gaining understanding through faith, exploring the depths of one's own mind to find proof of God. He proposes that because God exists within our understanding, we can't conceive of his nonexistence. In essence, Anselm suggests that the proof for God lies within the confines of our own minds, and that we don't need external evidence to confirm his existence. This idea relies on the concept of faith, which, within Christian texts, refers to accepting truths without empirical proof. This line of thinking often raises eyebrows, as it seems to defy the need for concrete evidence.\n\nIn stark contrast, Thomas Aquinas takes a more cerebral approach. He argues that the existence of God can be proven solely through reason and empirical evidence, eliminating the need for faith altogether. This perspective would be particularly valuable in evangelism, a vital aspect of Christianity, as it would allow for the recruitment of new followers without relying on their willingness to accept the unproven. Instead, logic would be the driving force behind their conversion. Aquinas presents five logical arguments in support of God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each showcases the logical necessity for God's existence, demonstrating that we can deduce the existence of the missing piece (God) even when it's not directly visible, much like completing a puzzle.",
            "About 2500 years ago, in ancient times, a prince was born who would eventually be known as the Buddha. Throughout his life, he rejected worldly pursuits, achieved enlightenment, and his teachings gave rise to Buddhism. However, the faith has undergone significant changes over the centuries. This transformation is apparent in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed, a tradition that was never explicitly taught by the Buddha himself. These changes span from superficial customs to the very core of the faith, encompassing both the monastic and lay perspectives. The Theravada Buddhist community has had to adapt its core principles over time due to external and internal influences, both benevolent and malevolent.\n\nIn this discussion, certain terms will be used extensively. 'Internal force' refers to any change originating within the Buddhist community, while 'external force' denotes any influence from non-Buddhists. A 'hostile force' is any influence that seeks to harm or damage the Buddhist community, often stemming from a negative perception of Buddhism. Conversely, a 'benign force' does not intend to harm or help the community, though its outcomes may be unintentionally detrimental or beneficial.\n\nLet's delve into the fundamental principles of Theravada Buddhism, which form the bedrock of the faith. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is comprised of the Tripitaka, consisting of the Sutta Pitaka, Vinaya Pitaka, and Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Sutta Pitaka houses the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the monastic disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka deals with the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. These concepts include Anatta (no fixed self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these ideas is crucial to breaking free from Sansara, the cycle of birth and death, and eventually, attaining enlightenment, thereby ending lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka outlines rules for laymen, including the five precepts (non-harming, truthfulness, non-stealing, chastity, and abstinence from intoxicants), while monks adhere to numerous additional rules. The four noble truths, a fundamental Buddhist concept, state that life is marked by Dukkha, attachment causes suffering, and that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico - a tale of a 57-year rivalry that spanned the years from 1836 to 1893. It's a story of clashes, compromises, and a long, winding road to eventual understanding. The rivalry, which reached its peak in the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, was a defining moment in the history of both nations. The war saw the United States emerge victorious, claiming Texas and the American Southwest as its own. However, it wasn't the only confrontation between the two countries. There were many skirmishes, disputes, and standoffs that continued to simmer until just before the outbreak of World War I.\n\nAt the heart of the rivalry were fundamental disagreements over issues like faith, culture, and tradition. The two nations also had competing material interests, which often led to confrontations. This pattern is all too familiar in the world of international relations, where nations sharing a border often find themselves at odds over competing interests. The United States and Mexico are just one example of many long-standing rivalries that have shaped the complex web of relationships between nations.\n\nHistorians like David M. Pletcher have noted that the United States has had its fair share of diplomatic headaches over the years, particularly with Mexico and Cuba. These two countries, due to their proximity to the United States, have often found themselves at odds with American interests. In contrast, many other Latin American nations have enjoyed relatively smooth relations with the United States.\n\nReligious differences were another point of contention between the United States and Mexico. This was a trend that echoed throughout history, as nations have often been driven apart by fundamental disagreements over faith and governance. Sally Frahm observed that Americans have historically been wary of Catholicism and monarchy, just as they were opposed to fascism and communism in the 20th century. This ideological divide was deeply rooted in the distrust that existed between the English and Spanish empires, which in turn had a lasting impact on the relationship between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts documented 17 significant disputes between Mexico and the United States during this 57-year period, with most of them centering on territorial issues, border raids, and frontier problems. The issue of bandits and outlaws crossing the border was a recurring problem that only began to subside when both countries fortified their borders. As Schmitt pointed out, the rivalry between the two nations began to dissipate as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the United States, and American interests shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico.",
            "It's hard to believe it's been fifteen years since my life was turned upside down by a mysterious illness that I'd never even heard of. At the time, I was living my dream as a nurse, a career I'd chosen to escape the uncertainty of my own childhood. The mantra I'd heard over and over as I grew up was, \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\" So, I put my aspirations of becoming a scientist or journalist on the backburner and pursued nursing instead.\n\nFast forward to my 46th birthday, and I was faced with a harsh reality: I was struggling to make ends meet, with no savings to speak of, and unable to work due to my illness. Fifteen years later, I'm still living on Social Security Disability, and I've lost everything that was once mine. Every day is a grueling battle to maintain my security, safety, and self-respect. Yet, amidst the chaos, I've come to realize one invaluable truth: when disaster strikes, we all need a little help from our friends and family, no matter how strong we think we are. And trust me, when real disaster hits, strength is the last thing you feel like you possess.\n\nMy point is that life is unpredictable, and emergencies can lurk around every corner, big or small. No matter how well-prepared we think we are, some challenges are simply too big to tackle alone.\n\nI agree that we should be cautious about relying too heavily on government support, but I firmly believe that Americans would be better off learning to trust and help one another rather than turning to individualism as a solution. The idea of rugged individualism that our country was built on is a myth; it was actually the compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources of our forefathers that carried them through tough times. The pioneers who crossed the country in wagon trains didn't make it on their own; they had each other.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared – I've got my disaster kit and emergency supplies ready. I've got flashlights, first aid supplies, and a stash of canned goods, just in case. But while it's essential to be prepared, it's equally important to build a community that looks out for one another. Get to know your neighbors, and who knows, you might just find a lifeline when you need it most.",
            "Evolution's intricate dance - what drives it forward? Are there unseen forces that shape the course of change in the natural world? It's a question that has puzzled scientists for centuries, from D'Arcy Thompson's groundbreaking statements in 1917 to the present day. Despite the advances in mathematical modeling, the complexity of organic forms remains a mystery waiting to be unraveled. Recent studies, however, have applied mathematical modeling to the intricate processes of mollusk skeletogenesis, both during development and evolution (Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research delves into how mathematically modeling ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, combined with experimental studies, can shed light on the mechanisms behind evolutionary-developmental change.\n\nWe used high-tech X-ray images of Prunum species to quantify key parameters that can be used to model hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. These parameters were then fed into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995) to create a virtual framework for understanding the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. By combining these results with experimental and observational studies, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying forces that shape macroevolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a dynamic, three-dimensional structure that grows and changes over time, like a spiral that unwinds through 360 degrees of space. Each coil is called a whorl, which spirals around an imaginary central axis, or columella, that runs through the shell's central column. The rate at which whorls expand can vary, and the continuous lines separating each whorl are called sutures. In most shells, the last whorl, or body whorl, is the largest. The spire is the collective whorls excluding the last one, while the apex is the spire's tip and the base is the opposite end. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from different angles - apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural - with the \"classic\" view being the apertural perspective, where the aperture faces the viewer and the apex points upwards.\n\nTo count whorls, start by viewing the shell from the apical angle and mark where the first suture begins. Draw a line dividing the shell in two, then count the whorls from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures that traverse time and space as the animal builds its shell. By tracking the center of each whorl's aperture and its horizontal and vertical radius, we can map the shell's path through space and time. This trajectory can be represented graphically and mathematically, allowing us to manipulate the parameters and explore the mollusk's skeletogenesis in greater detail.",
            "We've all been watching Indonesia struggle to make headway in reducing neonatal and infant mortality rates over the past decade. Despite making strides in meeting some of the Millennium Development Goals, such as water and sanitation targets, the country has been woefully slow to improve child and maternal health. This plateau highlights the need to strengthen the overall health system rather than pinning our hopes on targeted programmatic interventions.\n\nThe statistics are telling. While 72% of births in Indonesia now involve a skilled health worker, this figure is somewhat misleading because it includes traditional workers like midwives who aren't equipped to handle complications. The consequence is a high number of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage. Moreover, the rate of diarrheal cases in children under five treated by a health professional has been on the decline. Unfortunately, data on postnatal care is incomplete, and what we do have suggests that this area is a major concern, with low rates across the country.\n\nCesarian-section rates are still disconcertingly low at 4% nationwide, but the disparity between urban and rural areas is even more striking. While 7% of urban births involve a C-section, this rate drops to an alarming 2% in rural areas. This stark contrast highlights the issue of unequal access to healthcare services, with urban areas reaping the lion's share of the benefits. Another pressing concern is vertical equity: there's a staggering 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles. This means the poor are struggling to access healthcare services, largely due to the financial burden of out-of-pocket costs.\n\nSo, what's the way forward? The fundamental question is how to effectively address the glaring lack of services. Should Indonesia focus on targeted programmatic approaches or strengthen the overall health system? While program-specific solutions may seem attractive, yielding faster results and more manageable objectives, they have their drawbacks. Investing heavily in one area can divert resources from other essential areas, drawing human resources towards the most funded sectors. Moreover, running multiple parallel programs can lead to duplication of services, uncoordinated between programs, resulting in increased paperwork and administrative burdens.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their meticulous attention to detail and their focus on the lives of the aristocracy of the time period. However, two works that deviate from this norm are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. Both novels incorporate elements of mystery and a touch of the bizarre, characteristics that were not typical of novels from the era. These unconventional features serve to strengthen the characters within each novel, offering valuable insights into their motivations and emotions.\n\nAs the characters navigated the chaotic world around them, their minds were flooded with a multitude of bewildering ideas. The lines between reality and fantasy began to blur, and it seemed as though they were trapped in a never-ending cycle of confusion. In Oliver Twist, for instance, the protagonist's inner turmoil is revealed through his dreamlike states and hallucinations. These strange visions offer a glimpse into Oliver's inner world, exposing his deepest fears and pains. The vivid description of the shooting in chapter 28 is a prime example of this. Oliver's reliving of the traumatic event is a stark reminder of the lack of control he had over his circumstances, and the devastating impact it had on his health.\n\nThe passage is a poignant portrayal of Oliver's emotional state, as he struggles to come to terms with the dire reality of his situation. His hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit serve as a constant reminder of the pain and fear that he endured. The \"unseen hand\" that swept him away is a powerful symbol of the overwhelming forces that controlled his life, leaving him feeling powerless and defeated. The passage implies that Oliver's experiences have broken him, rendering him incapable of taking control of his own life, even in the face of danger.\n\nIn a similar vein, the novel Wuthering Heights employs dreamlike sequences to reveal the inner workings of its characters' minds. The passage from Wuthering Heights describes a sense of time and space that is distorted and disjointed, reflecting the characters' emotional states. The day and night seem to blend together, creating a sense of timelessness and desperation. This portrayal of the characters' inner world serves to underscore their emotional turmoil and the sense of being trapped in a world beyond their control.",
            "A couple of years ago, I had the chance to work with elementary school students in an after-school program, where I tried to help them with their academic struggles, particularly in English and reading. However, I was approached by one of the instructors to assist a young boy named Adrian, who was in third or fourth grade. What struck me was that his reading difficulties didn't seem to follow the usual pattern. Some letters he could pronounce flawlessly, while others left him completely stumped. It was baffling, especially since he spoke perfect English. I had a hunch that his linguistic background might be the key, and I was right. His mother, who walked in on me while babysitting, only spoke Spanish, and I realized that Adrian's issue wasn't reading per se, but rather not knowing the English alphabet. This epiphany revealed to me how easily language barriers can masquerade as reading difficulties. I'm not sure how much it helped Adrian, but I hope he's made progress since then.\n\nI share this story to highlight the complexities of language barriers in schools, particularly in California, and to show that the issue isn't always as straightforward as we think. Even for children who speak perfect English, reading can still be a significant hurdle. It's clear that this problem exists, so what can we do about it? In Adrian's case, the solution was simple: targeted tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for children who barely speak English, the solution is far more intricate. There is no single answer. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, and ESL classes, each by itself, won't solve this problem. The key lies in combining these approaches.\n\nThe dual language system is an excellent concept that can benefit all children, not just those whose first language is Spanish. Research has shown that \"children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.\" Many people fear that such programs will waste resources and only benefit a minority of students, but this is a misconception. If implemented as the standard, rather than an exception, all children would benefit from these programs. So, how can we make this happen? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? That would be unrealistic and impractical. Instead, we can have bilingual aids, tutors, or support staff to help.",
            "We're often fed the notion that there's something greater than us, something we can't fully grasp since childhood. Some of us head to Sunday school, others to the temple, while many more turn inward in search of answers. Many of us simply accept the faiths passed down by our parents, but some of us reject them outright, convinced that there's nothing beyond our own understanding. We may adopt one value system only to later replace it with another. Ultimately, our journey is about defining ourselves through our unique perspectives on spirituality, seeking a guiding light in the darkness to lead us from the shadows into the light.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\nI remember a conversation with my dad, sitting on our porch as the rain poured down around us. We sat amidst the sound of raindrops pounding on the tin roof, surrounded by the dying plants along the edge of the porch. My dad's eyes were lost in thought, gazing out into the rain with a mix of introspection and reminiscence. He'd grown thinner and frailer over the past few months, his hair thinned out, and his clothes hung loosely on his frame. I sensed a deep sadness, a sense of unease, and a reluctance to confront the reality of his impending loss. I hugged him, sat back down, and joined him in staring out into the rain-soaked evening.\n\nMy dad passed away just five days after my twenty-second birthday in December. The chemo and radiation had prolonged his life by a few months, but it only prolonged his suffering. I couldn't help but wonder, what kind of higher power would do this? As I lay alone in the dark that night, I didn't say any prayers. If there was a God, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI chose not to watch my dad's final days. I couldn't bear to witness the life that created me slipping away. I wanted to remember my dad as he lived, not as he died. I knew him better than anyone else did, and I was certain he wouldn't have wanted me to be there for his passing. I curled up in a ball in bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nBut the phone never rang.",
            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" is a paradox in and of itself, as literary critic Ian Watt so aptly described it as an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New.'\" [The Rise of the Gothic Novel] The Gothic mode has been subject to a range of reactions, from scathing criticism to fervent praise, with some accusing it of lacking depth and others lauding its ability to evoke a sense of the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke).  Interestingly, the genre's birthplace can be attributed to Horace Walpole's 18th-century masterpiece, The Castle of Otranto, which successfully blended elements of both \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances to create a new literary form.  Walpole cleverly combined \"old\" theatrical elements with the \"new\" narrative style of modern novels to craft a story he dubbed \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre draws heavily from medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions, often incorporating them in a way that adds to its mystique. At the time of The Castle of Otranto's publication, the term \"gothic\" was already being used to describe various cultures, styles, and eras, often with a hint of nostalgia or even disdain for what was perceived as outdated or unsophisticated in the face of modern advancements. The union of the theatrical \"Gothic\" with the novel's innovative format, which allowed readers a more intimate glimpse into the characters' psychology, enabled the Gothic genre to endure for centuries, becoming both nostalgic and new to readers from different eras.\n\nOne of the most enduring Gothic ideas is the concept of Chivalry, which has its roots in medieval times. The original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto, explores this idea, adapting and transmuting it to create a sense of an idealized past. Chivalry, with its associations of bravery, honor, and competence, was crucial to Gothic writers like Walpole, who saw it as a lost ideal in their own time. Through the use of chivalric concepts and mannerisms, the \"gothic past\" becomes romanticized and idealized, hinting at the future evolution of Gothic into Romantic literature. As Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto during a tumultuous period in history, he may have believed that the supposed morality and goodness of the Gothic era had been lost in modern society. This sentiment is evident in the character of Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits, including being a prince, having suffered tragedy, and being described in a way that exaggerates traditional chivalric images. This character serves as a precursor to the Gothic trope of excess, which would become a hallmark of the genre (66).",
            "The concept of supply chain management has been evolving rapidly over the years, and I've seen firsthand the transformation of the way companies manage their goods movement from raw materials to the final customer. The term 'supply chain management' was coined in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant who recognized the importance of streamlining the process to meet customer demands efficiently. The entire supply chain process involves planning, implementing, and controlling various stages to ensure customer satisfaction. At its core, supply chain management is about orchestrating the six key elements: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information to provide exceptional customer service.\n\nProduction is where it all begins. It's the foundation upon which the entire supply chain is built. This stage involves outlining the when, why, where, and how of production, which requires managers to stay attuned to customer needs. By analyzing market trends, managers can gauge what customers are demanding and decide what products to produce, in what quantities, and where to produce them to meet customer expectations. The location for production is critical, as it affects volume and quality, so managers must weigh these factors carefully.\n\nOnce production is underway, managers focus on scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. Every detail is crucial, as any misstep can lead to costly delays and inefficiencies down the line. I've seen this firsthand in my retail days at places like Wal-Mart and Target, where even the smallest processes – from employee uniforms to receiving shipments – are meticulously planned and executed to ensure a seamless customer experience.\n\nThe next key element is supply, which involves strategic decisions about core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. Companies often have multiple divisions for a single product, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers must decide which division is best suited for each process and may choose to outsource work to other companies to boost velocity – the ability to deliver high-quality products while keeping costs low. By outsourcing, companies can tap into new capabilities and expertise, allowing them to stay competitive in the market.",
            "I was staring at a haunting message scrawled on a cardboard sign held aloft by Ellen Page, the talented actress from Juno. \"Hitler is alive in Burma,\" it read, the words etched with a Sharpie in bold, stark letters. I couldn't help but wonder about the tumultuous history of Burma, now known as Myanmar, a Southeast Asian nation ruled by a ruthless military junta that seized power in 1962 through a sudden coup. In 2007, a wave of protests erupted, led by courageous Burmese monks clad in their distinctive saffron robes. Dubbed the \"Saffron Revolution,\" these gatherings marked a rare moment of public defiance in a decade of silence. However, the government's initial hesitation to crack down was short-lived, and soon the violence escalated into a brutal conflict between the monks and the military, with troops invading and ransacking monasteries across the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned, with a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, tragically killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for witnessing a street protest. Estimates of the death toll varied, with some reports claiming as few as 13 fatalities, while Colonel Hla Win, a former army officer, whispered a chilling truth: \"Many more people have been killed in recent days than you've been told. There are thousands of bodies to count.\"\n\nThis is a story as old as civilization itself. Throughout history, governments have sought to suppress dissent and maintain complete control over their citizens. Ancient Roman emperors declared themselves divine rulers, while Japanese emperors were believed to be gods, sent to guide their people to prosperity – or so they claimed. Our own President George W. Bush allegedly held weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of the self-proclaimed Stupid People Worldwide, a group that seemed to be an offshoot of the Republican Party.\n\nThere have been countless examples of these power-hungry tactics. The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where students, intellectuals, and labor activists dared to challenge the Chinese government, resulted in a mysterious death toll that ranged from 200 to a staggering 3,000. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, backed by the Rwandan government, systematically slaughtered Tutsis and political moderates, was another egregious example. And then, of course, there's the infamous Holocaust, where Hitler's 'Third Reich' machinery rounded up and killed millions of Jews.",
            "The impact of Duke Ellington's legacy in jazz is largely due to his remarkable longevity and, by extension, his incredible ability to push the boundaries of his orchestra through his creative vision. While his piano playing is often understated in many of his compositions, as a composer Ellington excelled in crafting rich and complex pieces that showcased the unique talents of each band member. He skillfully designed the framework for soloists to improvise freely, as well as writing tightly orchestrated sections that highlighted the distinctive style of individual musicians, all while maintaining a cohesive tone for the entire orchestra. Through this approach, Ellington managed to create some of the most groundbreaking and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative use of voice as a jazz instrument, as seen in Creole Love Call, an early example of using voice to add texture and depth without the constraints of lyrics. This piece demonstrates Ellington's ability to complement the style of his soloists, a trait evident throughout his career. The 12-bar blues piece features six distinct choruses, including a call and response between voice and reeds, a muted trumpet solo, a sweeping clarinet solo, a full-band echo of the first chorus, a climactic reed-driven chorus, and a final chorus with a return to the call and response structure, where the voice takes on the sound of the \"growl\" technique. A brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant trombone ending rounds out the piece.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add a dimension of tone color is a stylistic trait that permeates his work. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year after Creole Love Call, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color, creating a rich and complementary sound through a call and response phrase between Bubber Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing. This technique is further explored in It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), where Ellington uses Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone. These examples showcase Ellington's mastery of creating innovative and harmonious sounds that bring out the best in his musicians.",
            "It's a nagging feeling that's been haunting her since she was 14. A yearning that refused to be satiated, growing stronger with each passing year. At 17, it was still there, gnawing at her insides. She'd initially thought it was a desire for something, but as the years went by, she realized it was actually a longing for someone. However, the people who had caught her attention just didn't seem to fit the bill. She found herself questioning this peculiar affliction, trying to pinpoint its source, but nothing seemed to stick. The years of contemplation had yielded a multitude of theories, yet none of them felt quite right.\n\nThose were usually the days when life was idyllic at home. Her parents were a tranquil couple who rarely argued with each other, and when they did, it was usually over her desire for independence and free-spirited nature. She, the free-spirited daughter of calm parents, brought a whirlwind of energy to the household. It was a dynamic that worked surprisingly well, and her likability made it easy for people to warm up to her.\n\nBut today was a different story. As she wandered through the house, searching for inspiration, the serene atmosphere was shattered by a blood-curdling scream from the kitchen. Her mother's voice, a melodious sound, was now laced with distress. Panic set in as she rushed to the kitchen, her mind racing with worst-case scenarios. \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" she exclaimed, dashing into the room. Her mother was on the ground, writhing in agony, her words barely above a whisper. \"Ow...sweetie, I...need you to take me to...the hospital.\" The desperation in her voice was palpable, and her daughter sprang into action. \"Okay, Mom, where can I pick you up?\" she asked, trying to keep her cool. Her mother's directions were fragmented, but her daughter was grateful for the classes that had honed her physical strength. She carefully lifted her mother and placed her in the car, driving her to the hospital with a sense of purpose.\n\nThe hospital's sterile scent and eerie atmosphere only added to the tension, but her daughter's focus was solely on her mother. She quickly ushered her into a treatment room, called out for medical help, and watched as the doctors and nurses swarmed in to attend to her mother's wounds. It turned out her mother had taken a tumble off a step stool while reaching for a vase on the top shelf of their kitchen cabinet. The worry etched on her face gave way to relief as the medical team sprang into action, and she waited anxiously for news about her mother's condition.",
            "A recent study shed light on the benefits of following the Mediterranean Diet, also known as the Med diet. The study found that women who adhered to this diet, as reflected by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" had a lower risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke. The aMed diet is a variation of the Med diet that emphasizes plant-based foods, such as fruits, nuts, whole grains, legumes, and fish, while reducing consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol intake is also allowed.\n\nPast research has consistently shown that a Med diet is associated with a reduced risk of total and heart-related mortality. In fact, one study found that the Med diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and improving cholesterol levels in obese individuals. However, previous studies did not focus specifically on the relationship between the Med diet and stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis new study, which followed 74,886 female nurses over a 20-year period, discovered a significant association between higher aMed diet scores and lower risks of CHD and stroke. The study used data from the Nurses' Health Study, a large cohort study that has been monitoring the health of 121,700 female nurses since 1984. The researchers computed the aMed diet score six times between 1984 and 2004, using self-reported food frequency questionnaires that assessed nutrient intake over the previous year. The study found that a high aMed diet score was associated with a 29% lower risk of CHD and a 29% lower risk of stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile.\n\nTo minimize random variation and better capture long-term dietary habits, the researchers averaged the aMed scores from multiple questionnaires. They also adjusted for various confounding factors, such as age, smoking status, body mass index, menopausal status, and physical activity. The study's findings suggest that following a Mediterranean-style diet may be an effective way to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke in women.",
            "We're still reeling from the aftermath of the 2007 financial crisis that ravaged the United States. The unemployment rate skyrocketed, the housing market imploded, and some of America's most influential corporations were left in shambles. So, let's face it – we're still wondering: how did this disaster unfold, and what can we do to prevent it from happening again? In a nutshell, the crisis was born from a toxic mix of self-serving and naive decision-making that forced banks and financial institutions to hand out sub-prime loans into a fragile financial ecosystem. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were strong-armed into underwriting and repackaging these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks found themselves woefully underfunded, and the chaos spilled over into the re-packaged mortgages they'd sold, ultimately infecting the entire economy.\n\nBut the seeds of this disaster were sown back in the late 1990s, when the Clinton administration was hell-bent on securing a second term in office. To bolster his popularity, they relaxed lending restrictions, creating a perfect storm for the sub-prime crisis that would unfold seven years later. In 1999, New York Times journalist Steven Holmes pointed out the impending doom: \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest mortgage underwriter, was under intense pressure from the Clinton administration to expand mortgage loans to low- and moderate-income households, all while satisfying shareholder demands for phenomenal growth in profits.\" Holmes astutely predicted the consequences of these actions: \"But the government-subsidized corporation might struggle in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As we now know, the results were catastrophic.\n\nA perfect storm of factors contributed to the economic meltdown, including the increasingly complex mortgage landscape. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) became ubiquitous in the years leading up to the crisis, entangling more sectors of the economy in the housing market. This created a housing bubble that left U.S. households and financial markets paper-thin, vulnerable to even the slightest price fluctuations.\n\nIn the end, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were left reeling. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, equivalent to about 30% of the USA's GDP. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at fire-sale prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subject to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were brought under government control in September 2008.",
            "The agony and ecstasy of exposition.  That pivotal moment in your story where you spread your wings and soar, leaving your readers in awe of your masterful prose - or, conversely, nodding off to sleep with a silent curse.  Dr. Merlin has been known to slam her monitor in frustration when she finds herself bogged down in Too Much Information, and not in the good kind of way.\n\nExposition: the nemesis that worms its way into every writer's narrative, begging to be told - and told in excruciating detail.  We've all heard the mantra, \"Show, don't tell,\" but even seasoned writers like Dr. Merlin still find themselves succumbing to the lure of lengthy passages that leave the reader wondering what's happening.  It's the inner voice that whispers, \"Get the backstory out of the way so we can get to the good stuff,\" but in truth, it's often the devil in disguise.\n\nExposition is the act of telling the reader what happened, in straightforward prose.  In film, it's the character's info dump, à la \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, it's the author's way of telling, not showing.  And let's face it, it's a slippery slope.  \n\nConsider this example: a heroine meets her beloved, gets married in a grand ceremony, and her husband is murdered before her eyes.  You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to unfold over two pages, with only two lines of dialogue from each character.  You'd want to see the husband's character shine through in his words and actions, and the heroine's growth and depth as she navigates their relationship.  A proper introduction to the husband would make his death all the more impactful, allowing you to mourn his loss alongside the heroine and deepen your connection to her.  In short, you'd crave substance, not just the bare-bones storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs writers, our task is to deliver that substance.  It's tempting to rush past the details, especially when introducing new characters, but resist the urge.  Don't settle for a superficial \"He used to be in the Air Force, now he's the night manager of a gas station, married twice, no kids, likes fishing on the weekends, dreams of owning the station, and loves Eggs Benedict.\"  Give your readers the richness they deserve - the meat on the bone of your story.",
            "I caught a couple of local news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio – NBC 4's morning newscast on August 13, 2011, being the first. The breaking story was about a man named Shad Hostettler, who'd stabbed his wife in Ashley, Ohio. His mug shot was flashed on screen, and let's just say he didn't exactly exude innocence. The news team barely scratched the surface of the incident, devoting only two minutes to the developing story. I thought that was a fair amount of airtime, considering the gravity of the situation.\n\nThe next story was about an 18-year-old named Travis Buyers, who was shot in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically injured and the police were still looking for leads. I noticed that this story seemed to receive relatively short shrift, which made me wonder if the neighborhood or the victim's ethnicity might have played a role in it getting less attention. I've long been struck by the way the media often glosses over stories involving minorities. When a white person is a victim, the media goes into overdrive, but when it's a minority, they get shortchanged.\n\nThe newscast then moved on to a story about a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. The authorities were tight-lipped about the investigation, but did reveal that a .22 caliber bullet had been fired from a rifle. A $5,000 reward was being offered for information that could lead to the shooter's capture.\n\nNext up was a story about the impending rain and thunderstorms forecast for Saturday afternoon. The weather report was brief, and I think that was intentional – the anchor was using it as a teaser to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nThe broadcast also covered a robbery at a UDF store on Clime Road. The perp was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie and a six-foot tall, 150-pound build. I found it interesting that the anchor emphasized the perpetrator's skin color and the color of his hoodie. It seemed like an unusual amount of time was spent on those details.\n\nAnother story was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin who'd been convicted of conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. I was puzzled by the way the anchor phrased his sentence – instead of saying 25 years in prison, they said 300 months. It wasn't clear what the point of that was. The anchor also mentioned Rodriguez's Hispanic heritage, but I'm not sure why that was relevant to the story.",
            "There's a bond between brothers that's impossible to break - a deep, unshakeable connection that weaves together a complex tapestry of emotions. Love, pride, jealousy, and the darker corners of cruelty all reside within this bond, creating a rich and multifaceted relationship that's both beautiful and brutal. Brothers have an uncanny understanding of one another, one that surpasses even the closest of friendships. When they look at each other, they see pieces of themselves, their own reflections staring back. It's in the darkest of times, when emotions run high, that the true nature of this bond is revealed, for better or for worse. With this bond comes a heavy price - the consequences of the emotions that fuel it. When we gaze into the eyes of a brother and see our own reflection staring back, we catch a glimpse of our true character, stripped bare of the facades we wear for the world. The choices we make and the actions we take are a testament to who we truly are.\n\nIn William Faulkner's \"The Sound and the Fury\" is not the correct text to be rewritten for the prompt, but instead, William Faulkner's short story \"The Old Man\" is not the correct text either. The story which is being rewritten is actually \"The Scarlet Ibis\" by Grant Wiggins. Through its vivid descriptions of a lush landscape, this tale of two brothers explores the intense emotions that come with this fraternal bond. In a heart-wrenching climax, bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride, and only one brother emerges unscathed. The author masterfully conveys the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist, Doodle, and his brother, as well as the narrator's observations, which serve as a powerful commentary on the true nature of their relationship. The protagonist's every move is driven by a single emotion: pride. From their early days together to their fateful final excursion, he harbors resentment towards his little brother, Doodle, who was born with a weak heart, making it impossible for him to participate in the adventurous life that his brother had envisioned. This crushing blow left the young protagonist reeling, his dreams of a playmate shattered in an instant. His anger towards Doodle is evident, as he even contemplates taking his life by suffocating him with a pillow - a chilling revelation that speaks to the darker corners of his heart. However, a simple smile from Doodle brings his brother's anger to the surface, revealing a glimmer of love and hope that had been lurking beneath. This moment of tenderness humanizes the protagonist, showing that his conviction was never as strong as he thought, and that love had always been present, even if it was hidden beneath the surface.",
            "It's no secret that the human brain is a complex, ever-evolving machine that processes information in ways both mysterious and miraculous. As technology has advanced from the Stone Age to the digital age, the metaphors used to describe our brains have evolved as well. Initially, our brain was likened to a piece of wax, then a scroll, then a book, and most recently, a supercomputer. While these analogies have served as a starting point for our understanding, it's essential to remember that they're limited and can lead us down the rabbit hole of misconceptions.\n\nSo, let's dive into the brain's inner workings. Information starts its journey as sensory input from our organs, which convert physical stimuli such as touch, heat, light, or sound waves into electrical signals. The brain then takes over, processing this info through a series of intricate algorithms that involve both bottom-up and top-down processing. Imagine looking at a picture of a black box on a white background. Bottom-up processing would break down the image into its basic components – color, orientation, and object borders – to conclude that you're seeing a box. Top-down processing, on the other hand, uses the decisions made earlier to speed up your recognition, perhaps identifying the object as a black box rather than a hole in the background.\n\nOnce the brain has processed the information to a certain degree, an attention filter kicks in, deciding which signals are most important and which cognitive processes to engage. Think of it like trying to find your name in a crowded room – your brain filters out the noise and zooms in on what matters. This attention filter is a crucial step in information processing, and it's a process that happens repeatedly throughout.\n\nFor the brain to process information effectively, it first needs to store it. We have different types of memory – sensory, working, and long-term – each with its own unique characteristics. The process begins with encoding, where information is transformed into a format that the brain can understand. For example, verbal input can be encoded based on its visual appearance, sound, or meaning. From there, the information needs to be maintained, and research suggests that working memory stores data for about 20 seconds by creating an electrical loop through a series of neurons. Long-term memory, on the other hand, is thought to be stored in the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are many theories about how knowledge is organized in the brain, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some are based on human behavior, others on computer science, and others on neurophysiology. One such model, the semantic network, proposes that our brain represents concepts as nodes linked by their relatedness. For instance, in this network, \"chair\" might be connected to \"table,\" which in turn is connected to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley's dystopian novel, Brave New World, serves as a scathing critique of the emerging technological and capitalistic structures of his time. In this fictional world, people prioritize community over individuality, and are conditioned from a young age to pursue instant gratification above all else. The citizens are mere pawns in a grand game, confined to a single ideology dictated by the all-powerful World Controller. Analyzing the novel through a Marxist lens reveals Huxley's underlying concerns about the developing systems. His use of Marxist terminology, such as homogeny and reification, underscores his suspicions about the flaws in the economy of his era.\n\nCapitalism is satirized through the concept of false consciousness, where the common citizen is kept in the dark about their true relationships with other classes in economic terms. Instead, they are preoccupied with their own selfish interests. This ideological control is evident in the conditioning of the population through hypnopædia, which strengthens their drive to consume, spend, and indulge above all else. The World Controller manipulates this conditioning, as we've seen, to maintain the status quo. Hegemony, the idea of groups being dominated by a separate, more powerful group, is a clear example of this in Brave New World. The working classes are blissfully unaware of their manipulation, essentially buying into an ideology that upholds the system (capitalism and consumerism). Meanwhile, the upper classes are aware of the manipulation but choose to do nothing, accepting their place in the hierarchy.\n\nIn Huxley's world, genuine relationships between individuals are few and far between. The characters, even major ones, lack depth and substance. One cannot help but wonder if Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together strips people of their free will and self-expression. Love and intense emotions are nonexistent; interactions are kept superficial, as seen in the males' shallow comments about women's physical appearance and the females' candid discussions of their encounters. Furthermore, the complacency of each social class in their position within the hierarchy reflects the socioeconomic effects of capitalism, where the proletariat is falsely convinced of their superiority as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform to their peers.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for roughly two and a half years now – four and a half semesters, give or take. For many of us, navigating the campus can be a real challenge. My first year in the East Halls dorm, nestled in the far reaches of campus, was a testament to this. The trek from my digs in Stuart Hall to places like the Willard building, near the heart of campus, often took up to 25 minutes on foot, especially when the unpredictable Penn State weather decided to make its presence known. I spoke with an alum not much older than myself, and it turned out that not too long ago, the East Halls dorms were effectively separated from the rest of the university by a vast expanse of unused land. Fast forward to today, and that empty space has been transformed into a thriving complex of sports fields, sleek new buildings, and trendy apartments, including the new Creamery and health services building. As our campus continues to expand, so do our transportation woes. What's the solution to this mobility conundrum? On a college campus, I firmly believe that the bicycle is the answer. However, a bike alone won't cut it; students need to hop on and the campus infrastructure needs to cater to cyclists' needs.\n\nI recently chatted with a friend who'd recently dusted off his bike after a few years away from it. He mused, \"Bikes are great – for a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Beyond being great exercise, bicycling is a highly efficient mode of transportation. A hearty bowl of oatmeal and a bit of physical exertion can take you 30 miles or more. As someone who now resides off campus, just as far from the heart of campus as some dorms, I made the smart move of investing in a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from my place. My trusty bike, on the other hand, can get me there in under 5 minutes, provided I pedal hard enough. The only catch is that Pollock Road is the most direct route to Thomas building, but it's not always the most bike-friendly road. I've found that walking has its merits, but I'm a busy bee and can't afford the extra time. Without my bike, walking would be my only reliable option, and it would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my day, devouring over two and a half hours every week. Factor in the time spent walking to and from other classes, appointments, and the like, and I'd be losing precious time I can ill afford to spare."
