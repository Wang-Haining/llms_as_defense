            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

I wanna learn all I can so I can be the best darn social worker I can be.\n\n Truth is, I've always felt kinda pulled towards helpin' folks. High school and college, I saw a lot of folks runnin' from their problems, tryin' to deal with 'em in ways that ain't right.  I even got my degree in Psychology, thinkin' that'd lead me somewhere. But I wasn't sure what path to take.  \n\nThen one time, my friend introduced me to this young fella, just sixteen, lookin' all scared and nervous. Turns out, he was runnin' from his folks 'cause they were treatin' him awful. I told the police what I knew, and they asked me to talk to his parents.  Well, let me tell ya, they weren't too happy about it. They tried to make excuses, sayin' he was just bein' manipulative.  That's when I knew, this is what I gotta do. Help these kids, help these families, even when folks don't wanna see it.\n\nAnd it ain't just about the kids, it's about doin' what's right.

There's two main ways to look at why folks can't get a good night's rest: the science stuff and the folksy stuff. \n\nThe science folks, they say it's all in your genes, passed down from your momma and daddy. They look at your body, see if there's anything screwy with your insides, makin' it hard to sleep. \n\nThe other folks, they say it's all about where you come from, who you hang with, and what kinda life you lead. They say things like your race, how much money you got, and even what kinda neighborhood you live in can mess with your sleep. \n\nThis here paper, it takes a look at both these ways of thinkin' about sleep problems. It talks 'bout all sorts of studies, seein' if they back up these ideas. And it ain't afraid to call 'em out if they're full of baloney, too!\n\nNow, sleep problems come in all shapes and sizes. Some folks just can't fall asleep, some folks can't stay asleep, and some folks have weird dreams or act all goofy in their sleep.  Some folks get these sleep problems 'cause of other stuff goin' on in their heads, like worry or sadness. \n\nThis paper, though, mostly focuses on sleep problems called insomnia, where folks just can't seem to get a good night's rest. It looks at how both the science folks and the folksy folks explain this problem.\n\nOne study, for example, looked at mice and their little sleep brains. They found that some tiny parts in the mice's brains that control sleepin' and wakin' had something called GABAB receptors.  Turns out, if these receptors are messed up, it can make the mice sleepy all the time! The scientists think this might be true for humans, too.  So, maybe some folks have sleepy genes!  \n\nThis study shows us that sleep problems can be caused by both our genes and our environment.

Maybe they're  strugglin' with stuff they ain't even aware of, and Viola just makes 'em face it head-on.  Or maybe Olivia's just a bit shallow, fallin' for whoever looks good, regardless of who they really are. She kinda ditches Cesario the second Sebastian shows up, and then suddenly Cesario's just family.  Kind of makes ya think about who we really love and why.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya, them Germans, they weren't all sunshine and rainbows when it came to runnin' their colonies. They got a real nasty reputation, especially for what they did to the Ovaherero and Nama folks in South West Africa, back when it was called that. But you can't just paint the whole darn empire with one brush, you know? Just like a pack of hounds, they acted different in different parts of the world. Same goes for their schools. Sometimes they built their own schools and taught the natives, other times they just let the fellas in funny hats do it.\n\nNow, in East Africa, where the Brits took over later, they found a bunch of folks who could read and write. The Germans had done some good there, some folks even said so back then. But down in South West Africa, it was a whole different story. They didn't care much for teachin' the locals. They mostly left that to the missionaries, who weren't exactly rolling in dough. \n\nThey were real keen on teachin' the white folks though, buildin' fancy schools and makin' sure the missionaries were doin' it right.  This messed things up real bad for South West Africa, even after the Germans were gone.  While other places had lots of smart folks, South West Africa was stuck in the dark ages. Nobody knew nothin' but their own language and traditions. \n\nWhy was it so different? That's what this paper's gonna try to figure out. We're gonna look at the folks who lived there, the folks who ran the show, and see what made them tick.  There's been a lotta books written about this, mostly in German, back when the Germans were still runnin' things. They mostly just described how the schools worked. But later, some folks wrote in English, comparing all the different parts of the German empire and lookin' closer at what made each place tick.",
            "Ya know, music these days, it's gotten crazy! There's so many different kinds of it, like rock, country, jazz, rap, even folk. And each one of them has got its own little offshoots, like branches on a tree. But heavy metal, that's something else. It's like the whole forest exploded, with all these different kinds of trees growing everywhere.\n\nIt all started about forty years ago, and people started realizing they could make this music really loud and intense, kinda like a dark storm cloud. They weren't afraid to sing about the tough stuff, the things that make you think, the bad times, ya know? And the music, man, it's got this power to it, all those guitars and drums, it just grabs you.\n\nNow, there are so many different kinds of heavy metal, it's hard to say what it really is anymore. It's like a melting pot, with bits and pieces of all these other genres mixed in. But you gotta remember, it all started somewhere.\n\nHeavy metal is more than just music, it's a whole attitude. It's about pushing the limits, being loud and proud, and not being afraid to be different. It's about the darkness, the raw emotion, the things that most people try to hide. Back in the seventies, there were all these drugs around, and they made people wanna express themselves in new and crazy ways. That's where a lot of the heavy metal sound came from. \n\nAnd you know what?  It's still going strong today. People still love that dark energy, that feeling of being alive.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya, this here Henri Rousseau fella, he was a dreamer, just like those fancy Surrealists, but he was doin' it way back before they came along. See, he painted this picture called \"The Dream\" back in 1910. Now, it ain't just some lady lookin' at pretty stuff in her dream, it's Rousseau himself dreamin' big dreams about bein' a famous painter. He wanted folks to like his work, ya know, to be recognized and all that jazz. But here's the thing, he was stuck in this pickle. He wanted to be accepted by the art snobs, but he also wanted to paint his own way, not just copy what everyone else was doin'.  It was a real head-scratcher for him.\n\nNow, lemme tell ya a little about this Rousseau guy. He wasn't born with a silver spoon in his mouth, not like those fancy art kids. He was a simple man, worked for the government collectin' tolls, nothin' fancy. He lost his wife and kids, so he turned to paintin' to make himself feel better. But he really wanted to be taken seriously as an artist.\n\nProblem was, he was up against some real tough competition. These other artists, they were already famous and makin' a name for themselves.  He was like a late bloomer, tryin' to catch up.  Some folks say he just wanted to paint somethin' so plain and simple that those fancy art folks would finally say, \"Hey, that ain't bad!\" But wouldn't ya know it, that's what made him different.",
            "Lotsa smart folks have said that good stuff and pretty stuff go together, same as truth and beauty. I reckon there's a reason for that. Like that fella Keats, he said, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty— That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" We learn a lot in life from books and doin' things, but we just seem to know when somethin' is right or pretty, without havin' to be taught. Both good stuff and pretty stuff are about describin' things, not tellin' ya how to do it. When we talk about what makes somethin' good art or right, we're mostly just tryin' to figure out why it is that way, not makin' rules for makin' it.\n\nHere's the thing, though: ya can't ever really put yer finger on what makes somethin' good or pretty.  Talkin' 'bout da Vinci's Mona Lisa, ya might say things like the way the front and back are done, or the colors, or even what kinda time it was made in. But that don't really tell ya why it's so darn good. When folks talk 'bout their favorite art or story, they'll often say somethin' like, \"There's just somethin' about it,\" before they can even begin to explain it. \n\nI reckon art and good stuff can't be fully explained, just like Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how much ya describe somethin', there's always somethin' more, somethin' special that ya just can't put into words. I think that's what makes art and good stuff so powerful.  It's that somethin' special, that je ne sais quoi, that connects 'em.\n\nI think art and good stuff are so close because we feel 'em deep down, in a way that's hard to explain.  Like when ya read a good book, it gets ya right in the gut. Literature especially, because it's all about values, just like life.  We love literature because it shows us what matters.",
            "Germany today is a real powerhouse, a united country with its own unique culture. You can feel it everywhere, from the fancy city of München in the mountains to the coastal town of Kiel by the Baltic Sea. It's the same in Köln on the Rhine River, all the way through to Dresden, a cool old city on the Elbe River. With a culture this unique, it shouldn't surprise anyone that modern Germany is made up of lots of different groups and tribes.\n\nNow, Germania is where the Germans came from way back in the day.  Folks can't agree on how the name came about, even the smart historians!  One guy named Tacitus said it came from a German tribe called the Tungrians, who were called Germans before they crossed the Rhine and fought with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98).  Julius Caesar, famous for his wars with the Gauls, was the first to use the word \"Germanus\" in his writings. He used it to separate the Gauls he conquered from the Germans who kept crossing the Rhine and causing trouble (Caesar, 50-40 BC). Some think Caesar got the word from the Gauls themselves, who used it to talk about their neighbors.  In his first book about the Gallic Wars, Caesar says, \"Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others say \"German\" comes from their fighting spears, called \"ger\" (O.E.D, 2010), or maybe from an old Irish word meaning \"to shout,\" which means the Germans were loud and noisy (Names of Germany).\n\nA Roman writer named Tacitus, back in 98 AD, wrote a book called \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" about where the Germans came from. He thought they were completely original, not mixed with other people from other places. He said, “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?” (Tacitus, 98)\n\nAnd who'd want to leave Rome for Germania?  Not the Romans, not at first anyway! They went into Germania to get things they wanted and fought battles sometimes, but mostly they went home to their big empire. So, while the Germanic tribes were around in the first century, they lived on the edge of the Roman Empire. They traded the stuff they got from the land and even fought in the Roman army (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "I looked down, my mind kinda blank, just taking in what was in front of me.  I wasn't feelin' nothin' much, just kinda watchin' it all go down. My brain was workin', but it wasn't makin' no real sense of it, just like, seein' stuff and lettin' it go.  Thoughts were poppin' in and out like fireflies, real quick and easy. It was like my mind was a river, just flowin' on by.  \n\nRemember that art book I got, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\"?  Ever since I was a kid, I wanted to learn how to draw, and this book was supposed to teach ya everything, right down to how your brain sees lines. One trick they show you is to put a square around somethin' you wanna draw, like a bowl of fruit on a table, and that turns it into just the bowl of fruit, simple like that.\n\nBut lookin' at this thing, I couldn't do that. It was too much, you know? Picasso had his blue period, Monet loved all them greens, and the old Italian guys, they used every color under the sun.  If I was gonna call myself an artist, then this was my start, my story, my \"Work in Brown\".  \n\nSo, I grabbed my tool, my hand moved, my mind tryin' to make somethin' outta nothin'. The water was calm, clean, and clear.  Stuff was breakin' off and floatin' away.  Then my hand got all tight, like I was nervous, and I slammed the handle of the toilet.  That brown thing wouldn't budge, stuck like glue.\n\nMop in my hand, standin' there with my tie chokin' me, I just stared at this thing someone left behind.  A few more flushes, a few more moments of thinkin' about nothin', then I grabbed the toilet paper and wrapped myself up like a glove.  Standin' up, then bendin' over, I reached into the bowl, like a mama checkin' on her turkey in the oven...",
            "Teenagers, dang, they're killin' themselves out there on the road! It's a real mess, y'all.  The brainiacs at the National Institutes of Health say our young'uns ain't quite got the noggin' for drivin' yet.  It's like givin' a 2x4 to a chihuahua - ain't gonna end well! They're just inexperienced, plain and simple. That means more wrecks, more roll-overs, more speedin', more cars endin' up in ditches than ya can shake a stick at.  \n\nAnd don't even get me started on havin' their buddies in the car!  Somebody smarter than me down in California did a study and figured out that the more little buckaroos in the car, the more likely somethin's gonna go sideways. \n\nNow, they're tryin' to fix it with these fancy \"provisional\" licenses, limitin' the hours they can drive and who they can haul around.  But that ain't gonna cut it!  The problem is, they're just not ready.  \n\nThis fella Zuckerman, a real smart cookie, says even 18 is too young! Says kids under 20 just gotta have that need for speed, like they're lookin' for trouble. \n\nSo, we gotta wait 'til they grow up a bit, ya know?  My momma always said, \"Patience is a virtue,\" and she was right!  Otherwise, we're gonna have more wrecks than a demolition derby, especially with all those baby boomers' kids gettin' their licenses soon. \n\nWe gotta do somethin', y'all.  Schools can teach 'em about drivin', but nobody under 18 should be behind the wheel.  Maybe a permit first, then some extra practice time with a responsible adult.  Just like the other states, we gotta make it a national thing, ya know?  Keepin' those young'uns safe is what matters most!",
            "So I was looking through these old movies from way back when Edison was makin' 'em.  Found fifteen of these \"trick\" movies from 1895 to 1901. These things are all about makin' stuff look like magic, ya know? I basically tried to figure out how they made 'em work and see if any of the later ones were doin' somethin' different. Most of these old movies, they're stuck in one spot, just like a stage play. No fancy mov'in' around the camera, just straight-on shots, nothin' fancy like you see now.  But some of 'em, they started to break the rules a little bit, doin' things like havin' more than one shot, which was pretty daring back then.\n\nOne thing all these trick movies got in common is they're filmed like a stage play. Picture a curtain, that's what these movies are like. The camera sits right there, like it's in the front row of the audience, and it don't move.  That's how they did it back then, just like those vaudeville shows, you know? The actors can only walk back and forth, never comin' right at ya or walkin' away. Like in this one movie, \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel,\" the fellas come in from one side and just move back and forth. The camera don't follow 'em anywhere.\n\nBecause they're stuck in this one spot, the shots are all long and sometimes medium.  They never get up close to anyone's face, not even once.  That's how they did it in those old theaters, too, you had to see the whole scene at once.\n\nAnd most of these trick movies, they're just one big shot, start to finish. Like one idea, one whole movie. That's why they're so short, maybe a minute or less. They're more like those little tricks you see in vaudeville, magic and stuff.\n\nBut here's the thing, what they call one shot ain't always one real shot. Sometimes they put a bunch of 'em together to make it look like somethin' is disappearin' or comin' back.  Take \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots,\" that one's from way back.  If you look real close, you can see where they cut together a bunch of shots to make it look like her head is comin' off.",
            "Listen up, folks! This John Taylor fella, he was a real firebrand back in the day, a true-blue Republican. Now, he was a farmer, through and through, but that didn't stop him from talkin' his mind on politics. He was all about freedom, you know, for himself and everyone else. And let me tell ya, he believed that a farmer's way of life was the best way to live. That's what shaped his whole outlook on government, from how it should be run to what it should be allowed to do.\n\nHe thought America had a real chance to get things right, see? No old traditions to hold us back, so we could build our own government, one where folks could rule themselves. He was a big believer in folks' natural rights, that everyone's equally important and deserve to be treated right. He thought those rights should be protected from the government, because if one guy gets trampled, it messes up everything for everyone.\n\nTaylor, he was a firm believer in good and evil, black and white. He said, \"Government's run by people, so it's gonna have all the good and bad that comes with people.\"  He wanted a government that protected your stuff, helped farmers out, and kept big businesses in check. He figured a good government, even if run by selfish folks, would still do right by everyone. He just wanted those in charge to remember that their job was to help the common man, not line their own pockets.\n\nNow, Taylor, he was a stickler for the Constitution. He wanted the government to stick to what it said in there, plain and simple. He knew a big government would be expensive and likely get out of control. But he also knew just reading the words wasn't enough. You gotta understand what the guys who wrote it meant! And he thought the Declaration of Independence was even more important, because it showed that America was made up of separate states, not just one big country.",
            "Listen up, 'cause I gotta tell ya 'bout this project we had. Figure 17 shows us folks weren't fillin' out them commuter logs like they used to. Kinda bummed me out, to be honest, 'cause I couldn't figure out why.  See, it was winter in New England, ya know, and folks ain't ridin' bikes or walkin' much when it's freezin' their butts off. December also means everyone's swamped with schoolwork and grades, so forgettin' about a log ain't exactly unheard of. Plus, December's when the holidays hit, and everyone's off vacationin' or visitin' family, so why'd they need to come to campus anyway?  Classes start back up in January, but that doesn't explain why folks weren't fillin' out them logs in February either. Maybe folks just got excited at the start, and then the spark died down.  \n\nWe tried to shake things up with the \"Carpool Challenge Week\" in March, kinda like a pep rally for carpoolin'.  Got folks submittin' logs again, but it was a real struggle to keep 'em goin'.  See, college life is all about breaks and holidays, and it's tough to get folks pumped about carpoolin' when they're busy havin' fun or just needin' a break.\n\nAnother thing is, folks love their cars. It's just how we are, ya know? So, to get 'em carpoolin', we had to bribe 'em with goodies. Gift cards to restaurants, coffee shops, and even a massage!  We even had some bigger stores throwin' in some goodies.  Think about it, though:  what if we had a shiny new bike, a fancy hybrid car, or even an electric car up for grabs? Maybe that'd get folks more excited.  We kinda stuck with the same ol' prizes, though.  If we'd upped the ante, maybe folks would have kept carpoolin' longer.",
            "Well lemme tell ya 'bout these fancy ETF things. They're like a basket of investments, kinda like them index funds, but you can buy 'em and sell 'em like regular stocks. You get the spread out risk of a whole bunch of stuff, but you can also do some fancy tricks like borrowing money to buy more or even betting against 'em. And the best part? They cost less to run than them mutual funds.\n\nNow, there's a catch, ya gotta pay a fee every time you buy or sell one, just like a stock.  And even though they sound great, you gotta make sure you're really getting that spread out risk they promise.  So I was lookin' at this ETF called IHF, and I figured I'd see if it was really worth it compared to just buyin' the biggest ten stocks inside it. \n\nIt turns out, IHF has ten biggies that make up most of what's inside. I figured, why not just buy those ten straight up?  So I did the math, and guess what? Buying just those ten stocks actually gives ya a better return and less risk than buyin' the whole IHF thing!\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' that's always gonna be the case, but it sure looks like it in this situation. It's like gettin' a bigger bang for your buck by just pickin' the best ten.",
            "This Edgar Allan Poe poem, \"Dream-Land,\" is one of his favorites. Poe uses the word \"Thulé\" a couple of times, and folks like Mabbott say he got it from Virgil. Virgil used it to talk about an island way up north, beyond Britain, that folks back then thought was the edge of the known world. Now, Virgil probably did use the word, but there's another writer Poe liked a lot, a German fella named Goethe, and some folks think Poe might have gotten the word from him too.\n\nThis is important because it shows Poe knew all about Goethe's writing. This guy, Karl J. Arndt, wrote a book comparing Poe's \"Politian\" to Goethe's \"Mignon\" and thinks Poe was really copying Goethe.\n\nYou see, Oxford says Goethe was a big deal, famous for writing a play called \"Faust.\" It's a long one, in two parts, with the first part coming out in 1808 and the second one right when Goethe died, in 1832.  Inside the second part of \"Faust\" is a little poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" It's about this king whose wife dies after giving him a special cup. He starts drinking a lot and crying over her. Eventually, he decides he wants to die too, gives his stuff to his kids, keeps the cup, walks to a cliff, throws the cup in the ocean, closes his eyes, and kicks the bucket.  The King of Thulé and the guy in Poe's poem are kinda similar, maybe like a dark twin of Poe's own sadness and how he used to drink too much.  \"Faust\" was also turned into a play by this guy, H P Grattan, in 1842, just a year before Poe used \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe uses \"Thulé\" twice in his writing. He uses \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" but in \"Dream-Land,\" he uses \"Thulé\" at the beginning and end of the poem, like bookends. You can almost think of \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" as going together. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker talks about this dark, lonely place called Thulé, where he's haunted by dead friends and everything is gray and lifeless.  You can see the same feelings in \"The King of Thulé,\" where Goethe's king is also lonely, lost, and doesn't want to live anymore. It's like Poe stepped right into Goethe's poem.\n\nGoethe was a big deal, and Poe would have known about him, especially since Poe loved Tennyson. When someone asked Poe if he admired Tennyson, he said, \"Yes, and Goethe!\" Aside from that connection to Tennyson, Poe would have read a lot of Goethe's stuff because it was being reprinted a lot after it first came out.",
            "So, this lady, Jennifer Palmer, took a spill in a grocery store 'cause some applesauce was left sittin' on the floor.  Now, she's sayin' the store manager, this Martin fella, knew about the spill,  heard about it twice, but didn't do nothin' about it for half an hour 'cause he was eatin' dinner.  She wants to sue him for damages, not just for her hurt, but 'cause she says he acted real mean and reckless.\n\nNow, the judge ain't gonna toss her case out right away. To get those extra damages, she's gotta prove Martin knew he was doin' somethin' dangerous, that he was basically messin' with folks' safety on purpose. She's gonna say, see, other folks had slipped and fallen there before, so Martin shoulda known better.  \n\nWhether he acted real bad, that's a bit harder to say. The judge might think it was just plain dumb, not necessarily mean, but it ain't lookin' good for Martin. \n\nHere's the deal: \n\nThis Rich Wayne, he works at the store, tells Martin about the applesauce spill around 5:00. Martin says he's on a break and doesn't wanna deal with it. Then, Mary Haddigan, another worker, tells Martin about the spill again at 5:15, same story from Martin.\n\nFinally, at 5:30, Palmer comes along, slips on that applesauce, and bam! Bad back.\n\nIt turns out, this ain't the first time folks have fallen in this store. Five times already that year, folks had gone down.  Palmer's sayin' Martin knew or shoulda known things were dangerous and didn't do nothin'.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya somethin'.  A few years back, I took this class on Islam, and we got into a real hollerin' match about whether it was a religion that wanted to bash yer head in or not.  Now, more than ever, that question's got me scratchin' my head.  Look at how things've changed since 9/11.  The media, they went from slammin' Islam and them extremists to coddlin' it like a baby.  I'll bet you a dang dollar we couldn't have had a fella like Barack Obama runnin' for president back then, what with his Muslim roots and all. \n\nNow, I gotta say, this story 'bout Muhammad, the prophet fella, it got me thinkin'.  See, I figured Muhammad was a real tough hombre, the kinda guy who'd take over tribes and force 'em to turn Muslim.  But this here biography, it paints him as some kind of martyr, misunderstood and humble.  Like folks just kinda wandered in, saw the light, and joined up.  Seems fishy to me, like they're tryin' to make him out to be somethin' he ain't.\n\nAnd get this, there's some real spooky similarities between Muhammad and Jesus.  Like when he turned some mutton and milk into enough for forty guys.  It's like they're tryin' to steal Jesus' thunder, makin' Muhammad look all holy and miraculous too.  Ain't that a kick in the pants?\n\nThen there's all these stories about folks convertin' on their own, but they're all secondhand accounts, hear-say, somethin' like \"So-and-so told me that So-and-so said...\"  Gives me the creeps, makes it all sound like a bunch of baloney.\n\nBut the thing that really gets my goat is how they try to make Muhammad out to be this sweet talkin', wise guy.  But history says somethin' different, and I just can't help but wonder if Muslims today know the real deal about how Muhammad came to power.",
            "Well, let me tell you somethin'.  After Jesus kicked the bucket, folks started preachin' about him in ways he probably wouldn't have liked.  Seems like Christianity got further and further from its roots over the years.  Nowadays, folks are gettin' more open-minded and wantin' things to change.  Some old-timers, though, they cling to the old ways and don't want nothin' new.  But they ain't gonna be the ones callin' the shots.  In time, more and more Christians are gonna want to go back to the basics, the stuff Jesus actually taught.  It might take a while, maybe even a hundred years or more, but it's gonna happen.  \n\nThink of it like rewindin' a tape.  We're gonna strip away all the extra stuff that got added over the years and get back to what Jesus was all about.  It's gonna start slow, but then it'll pick up steam.  Folks are gonna start thinkin' more like they did back when Jesus was around.  And guess what?  The churches, they'll be right there leadin' the way!  But instead of everyone bein' different, we'll all start thinkin' alike.  Like when different teams all join together to win a game.  \n\nHistory's full of these big turnarounds.  Remember when Christians were bein' persecuted by the Romans?  Well, look what happened!  The Romans became Christians themselves!  And in our own country, we went from slaves to leaders.   \n\nThis time, it's gonna be the same thing, only with religion.  We're gonna go back to the start, back to Jesus, and everybody's gonna be on the same page.   One thing that'll help this happen is folks startin' to see Jesus' words as somethin' more like a story, not just plain facts.   \n\nSo, what happened after Jesus?  Well, if you go way back, you see that it all started with Judaism.   They believed in one God, and they had these special books called the scriptures that they thought came from God.   The Jewish people weren't all on the same page, though.  There were different groups, like the Sadducees, the Pharisees, and the Essenes.  But they all shared some basic beliefs.",
            "You see, this book, \"The Jungle,\" it shows us that folks deep down, they're just out for themselves. They wanna make their lives as good as they can be, but they don't give a hoot about anyone less fortunate. It's all about lookin' out number one. Take those factory bosses, for example. They just wanna make their factories bigger and richer,  not a darn bit of care about who gets hurt in the process.  The book says it plain as day, these factories are like monsters, belchin' out smoke like it's nobody's business. They don't care about the people or the animals, just their bottom line. They're like those guys who drive their big trucks and don't even look when they pull out, runnin' over anything in their way. \n\nAnd those factory bosses, they don't care about their workers neither. They're just lookin' to squeeze every last penny they can out of 'em. They work 'em 'til they drop, then fire 'em without a second thought.  The whole place is just a mess of jealousy and hatred, everyone's lookin' out for themselves, 'cause nobody's lookin' out for 'em. These workers, they're like slaves, trapped in this system where they ain't got no rights. Unions are supposed to help, but they're just another bunch of guys lookin' to make a buck off the backs of the poor. You got folks workin' themselves to death, and nobody even cares.

            "So, this book writer, Fitzgerald, he's got tricks up his sleeve to make you feel a certain way about stuff.  He's like a magician with words, ya know? Sometimes he'll pair words together that don't usually go together, just to give ya a vibe. Other times, he picks a thing, like a color, and makes it mean somethin' special, then he uses that special meanin' to make ya feel somethin' about somethin' else.\n\nHe does this a lot with colors in his book *The Great Gatsby*. He's got these colors, like gold, green, white, gray, and red, and he gives 'em all these deep meanings. Then he uses 'em to make ya remember how somethin' makes ya feel.\n\nTake white and gray, for example. He makes 'em mean somethin' like sameness, like everything's the same. White's a bit nicer, fancier, while gray's more old and faded, ya know?\n\nHe shows ya this right from the start, with everyone wearin' white. Daisy and Jordan, they're always in white. Heck, even Nick's wearin' white to Gatsby's party! And Tom's got on a white shirt when he meets Myrtle.  The only time folks ain't wearin' white is when Nick's at Gatsby's party, and then it's all these loud, bright colors.\n\nFitzgerald uses these colors everywhere, like when Nick goes to work, he goes down these \"white chasms\" in New York.  And the names at Gatsby's party? They're all just \"gray names.\"  Even Catherine's apartment building looks like a big white cake, all the same.\n\nHe even uses white and gray for regular folks and places. Jordan and Daisy had a \"white girlhood.\" There are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in that depressing valley of ashes.  \n\nFitzgerald keeps us thinkin' about these colors, buildin' up this whole feelin' for 'em. Then, when he wants ya to think somethin' ain't important, or it's just part of the crowd, he uses white or gray.\n\nTake Daisy, for example. After he's been using these colors everywhere, he describes Daisy all in white, in her white car. Suddenly, she doesn't seem so special anymore, just like somethin' Gatsby wants, somethin' uniform, like a pretty package. \n\nHe does this with Daisy a few more times, makin' her seem more like a pretty picture than a real person. She's got a \"gray haze\" around her neck, and she's wearin' white again before that big showdown with Tom and Gatsby.",
            "Well, let me tell ya, San Diego's a pretty darn good place to grow stuff. That sunshine and mild weather? Makes for some mighty fine tomatoes, citrus, and all sorts of veggies. You got your squash, your broccoli, herbs galore, even peaches and lemons. And don't forget the berries and peppers!\n\nSeems like folks around here are real keen on their organic eats too. There's a whole heap of folks signed up for community-supported agriculture, waiting for their share of that fresh-picked goodness. And eggs and milk? Organic all the way, folks!\n\nA lot of these farms, they ain't just about the crops. They let you take a gander at how they do things, even go for a hike or watch the birds. Seems like a good way to make a livin' while helpin' out the environment, ya know?\n\nNow, organic farming ain't always easy. It takes a lot more elbow grease to keep those pests and weeds at bay without all the fancy chemicals. Plus, crops sometimes don't do as well as with the regular stuff. But, it sure does do wonders for the critters and plants around here. More biodiversity, that's what they call it.\n\nBut hold on, there's more to it!  These folks makin' a go of it with wildlife in mind, they gotta do all sorts of extra work. Plantin' special cover crops, makin' sure the animals have a good place to graze, even gettin' rid of those pesky invasives.  \n\nSo, this landowner I was talkin' about, he's got a real pickle on his hands. He wants to make a decent livin' and help the critters out too. That takes some know-how and a little help, ya see.\n\nThis land he's lookin' at, it's out near Potrero, a real beautiful spot.  It's got chaparral, grassland, and oak trees, all right next to that Cleveland National Forest.  They're sayin' there's all sorts of critters livin' there, some endangered, some just hangin' on.\n\nBeen sayin' this land's been around for ages, first the Native Americans, then some ranchers and folks sellin' firewood. Back in the day, this was a homestead, so it was probably used for grazin' or choppin' wood.\n\nNow, I found this piece of property online and figured out what kind of help this farmer might be able to get. I even found a real organic farm nearby, doin' pretty much what I'm talkin' about.",
            "Listen, everybody knows culture matters when you're tryin' to get somethin' done.  It ain't just about what a culture is, but what it ain't, you know?  It's not like everyone in a place is the same, like sayin' all Rednecks are stubborn or all them fancy Japanese are always playin' it nice.  That's just plain dumb talk.  \n\nWhat you gotta do is figure out how that culture's gonna play out in the deal you're makin'.  You see the world through your own eyes, and it's natural to compare, but you gotta go deeper than that.\n\nThink about it like this:  when you're dealin' with folks from a different place, you gotta learn their history, their hang-ups, the things they think are important.  Don't go tryin' to change 'em, just gotta respect it.  It's like when you're on someone else's turf - you gotta play by their rules, especially if you're the one with less to offer.  Treat 'em right, show 'em respect for their ways, and you'll get further.\n\nAnd it ain't just countries, you know.  Inside any big company, there's a whole culture goin' on.  Some places are all about workin' 'til you drop, others are laid back.  How they dress, how they talk, who they hire - it all tells ya somethin' about their culture.  Some companies encourage helpin' others, others are all about makin' money.  Just look around you - there's all kinds of different ways to do business.\n\nValues are the real key though.  They're the heart of a culture, the reason everything else is the way it is.  If a culture cares about lookin' good or gettin' along, they ain't gonna embarrass their boss to win a deal.  If they're all about makin' a tough bargain, they ain't gonna cave easy.  \n\nSo, before you walk into any kinda negotiation, do your homework.  Figure out the culture, what they stand for, what makes 'em tick.  And don't forget, get to know the folks you're dealin' with on a personal level too.  That's how you really make a deal.",
            "Dang ol' psalm talkin' about how folks say there ain't no God, right?  Well, that's what Anselm and Aquinas are tryin' to prove wrong.  They both believe in the same God, the one from the Bible.  Now, we gotta figure out whose argument makes more sense, so we're gonna pretend they're both right about God existin'. \n\nAnselm, he thinks we gotta look inside ourselves to find God.  He says since we can think about God, He must be real.  Kinda like, if you can picture a dang ol' redneck in a pickup truck, that means there's gotta be rednecks in pickup trucks out there, right?  Anselm's sayin' that God's gotta be real 'cause we can think about Him.  He calls it faith, I reckon.\n\nAquinas, he's a different kinda fella.  He thinks we can prove God exists with logic and stuff, like lookin' at the world and sayin', \"Hey, this ain't just happenin' by itself, there's gotta be a reason!\"  He's got five different reasons, but they all boil down to sayin' that God makes sense, ya know?\n\nBoth of 'em got some good points, but neither one of 'em really convinces me that God's gotta be real.",
            "Alright, so there was this dude, right? Way back in the day, like 5 or 600 BC, he was born a prince. But this dude, the one they'd later call Buddha, he decided to ditch the fancy life and go all spiritual. He figured out some stuff about how the world works, and his ideas started this whole religion called Buddhism. Now, the most straight-up kind of Buddhism is called Theravada, and it's been around for about 2,500 years. Things have changed a bit since Buddha was around, you know?\n\nLike, in Sri Lanka, these guys still do this big water-cutting ceremony every year. Monks and regular folks, they all join in, and it's kinda important to them, even though Buddha never mentioned anything about it. It's like that with a lot of stuff in Theravada Buddhism—some stuff's changed from the old days, both the little stuff and the big stuff.  The monks and the regular folks who follow Buddhism, they've had to tweak their ideas a bit over time. It's like, life changes things, ya know?\n\nWe gotta talk about some words a lot in this here story. We're gonna say things like \"internal\" and \"external,\" and \"hostile\" and \"benign.\" Think of it this way: \"internal\" means something coming from inside the Buddhist group, whether you're a monk or not. \"External\" means something coming from folks outside of Buddhism. \"Hostile\" means something bad for Buddhism, like someone trying to mess it up. \"Benign\" means something that's not trying to help or hurt Buddhism, but might end up doing one or the other by accident.\n\nFirst things first, let's get the basics of Theravada Buddhism down. Buddhists put their faith in the \"Triple Gem\"—the Buddha, his teachings (the Dhamma), and the community of Buddhists (the Sangha). The Dhamma is like a big library of Buddhist writings called the \"Tripitaka.\"  There's the Sutta Pitaka with all the Buddha's teachings, the Vinaya Pitaka with the rules for monks, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka with the deep, philosophical stuff about Buddhism.\n\nThey talk about things like Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (suffering), and Anicca (everything changes).  They think that by understanding these things, you can escape Sansara, which is like a big wheel of life, death, and being reborn over and over.  And when you get out of that wheel, you get rid of Lobha (desire), Dosa (hatred), and Moha (delusion). That's when you become enlightened.",
            "Listen, you ever hear about how the US and Mexico used to be like cat and dog, fightin' over everything?  They were at odds for like 57 years straight!  Back in the 1840s, we even went to war with 'em over Texas and parts of the Southwest.  It was a real mess, folks.  They call it the Mexican-American War, and we kicked their butts good.  But it weren't just that one fight, see?  They kept buttin' heads over things like religion, their way of life, and all sorts of stuff.  Kinda like how neighbors might argue over a fence or somethin'. \n\nThis ain't nothin' new, though.  Countries that live next to each other, they tend to get into it sometimes.  Look at us and Cuba, or even with Canada sometimes.  It's just how things go.  You got some folks sayin' that we've had more trouble with Mexico and Cuba than any other country.  Maybe they got a point.\n\nNow, religion played a big part in all this.  Back then, Americans didn't like Catholics much, and Mexicans, well, they were Catholic as can be.  Just like the Cold War, where we were against Russia 'cause of their communism, it was kinda like that, but with religion instead.  It ain't easy when you got different beliefs, you know?\n\nThese two countries, they had a lot of spats back then.  Mostly about land, and bandits crossin' the border and causin' trouble.  It took both sides sendin' in the troops to finally put a stop to it.  Eventually, though, things cooled down.  Mexico started dependin' on us more and more, and we weren't so interested in takin' their land anymore.",

I was a nurse back then, ya know, figured I'd always have a job, 'cause people always get sick.  That's what everyone kept sayin' growing up.  Truth is, I always wanted to be a scientist or a writer, maybe both, but  nursing seemed like the safe bet.  Well, here I am, 46, single, broke as a joke, and can't work.  Still can't, after 15 years on disability.  Got nothin' left,  barely gettin' by.  Every day is a fight,  feelin' like I'm losin' everything I got.  Nothing's certain anymore, except I couldn't have made it this long without my family and a few good friends.  'Cause when life throws you a real curveball,  strong don't mean a darn thing.\n\nMy point is,  life throws ya curveballs, big and small.  No use tryin' to predict 'em,  and sometimes,  no matter how prepared you are,  you just need a hand.  \n\nNow, I get it, we gotta stop relyin' so much on the government.  It's a mess, that much is clear. But wouldn't it be better if folks started lookin' out for each other again?  Help when they can, ask for help when they need it.  Rather than everyone buildin' their own little bunkers.\n\nThose folks talkin' 'bout rugged individualism,  they forget what really built this country.

It's kinda like tryin' to figure out how to build a house just by lookin' at a picture of it. We've got some smart folks tryin' to figure this out with math, like tryin' to write down the rules of how a shell grows up, ya know? They're lookin' at these ancient seashells called Prunum and tryin' to see how they changed over time.\n\nThey're usin' fancy pictures and computer programs to make models of these shells, kinda like buildin' a 3D puzzle. They wanna see what shapes are possible, like what kinda twists and turns a shell can take. Then they're gonna compare that to real shells and see how close they get.\n\nThink of a shell like a spiral staircase windin' around. Each step is a whorl, and the center pole is the columella. Some shells get bigger faster than others, and the line between each whorl is called a suture. The biggest whorl is the one at the bottom, and all the rest are called the spire.  \n\nAnyways, they're tryin' to figure out the rules of the game, how these shells change shape over time.

And that's why so many moms end up dyin' from bleedin' out after childbirth.

Should they just keep throwin' money at this problem with a bunch of different programs, or should they fix the whole darn healthcare system?  It's a tough call.  Programmatic approaches are easier to manage, but they can suck up all the resources and leave other parts of the system starved.

            "Victorian novels are known for their super detailed descriptions and their focus on the rich and fancy folks back then. But there are a couple of books from that time, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, that don't quite fit that mold. They're kinda spooky and a little weird, which is different from most novels from that era. This weirdness actually makes the characters more interesting, giving us a better understanding of what makes them tick.\n\nTake this passage from Oliver Twist:\n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\nThese books often use mystery and dream-like scenes to do this, but they do it in different ways. In Oliver Twist, these strange happenings show us what's going on inside Oliver's head, his pain, and how he sees the world around him. When Oliver gets shot, he relives it all over again in a dream-like state as he tries to find help. \n\nThis passage shows how out of control Oliver feels.  He's overwhelmed, and his pain is constant and linked with fear, not just shock.  It makes you wonder who's really in charge of his fate, because it's definitely not him.  He doesn't even try to fight back, even when his life is on the line.  This makes you think that maybe he's starting to give up hope, like Fagin has broken him and made him accept this miserable fate.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.\"",
            "A couple years back, I was workin' in this after-school program, helpin' out little kids with their schoolwork. I was pretty good at English and readin', so I'd help out with whatever those kids were strugglin' with. One time, they asked me to help this little fella named Adrian, maybe in third or fourth grade. He was havin' a real tough time readin'. I mean, it was just plain weird. Some letters he'd get right, but others, he'd butcher 'em somethin' fierce.\n\nYou see, Adrian was Latino, spoke perfect English, but his readin' was all messed up. We were hittin' a wall, I mean, I didn't know what to do! Then one day, Adrian's momma came to pick him up. Now, she didn't speak a lick of English. Just Spanish. I could barely spit out a few words myself, but we managed to get by. And that's when it hit me like a ton of bricks: Adrian could read just fine, he just didn't know the English alphabet that well. \n\nI ain't sure if that helped him much, but I sure do hope he's doin' better now. \n\nI tell that story 'cause it shows ya, there's this big ol' language barrier in schools, especially here in California. It ain't always as obvious as ya think. Even if a kid speaks English good, readin' it can be a real headache.\n\nWe all know this problem exists, so what can we do about it? In Adrian's case, it was easy: tutor him in English readin', teach him the alphabet and how to pronounce things right. But for kids who barely speak English, it's a whole different ball game. There ain't just one answer, ya know? Dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes, nothin' works all on its own. We gotta throw everything at it!\n\nDual language programs are a good start. Not just for Spanish speakers, but for everyone.  It's like, kids in these programs do better in school than the rest. Some folks are scared of it, think it wastes money and ain't good for everyone. That's hogwash! If we made these programs the norm, not the exception, everyone would benefit. \n\nBut how do we do it? Make every teacher bilingual? Nah, that's crazy talk. But we could have bilingual assistants, tutors, whatever ya wanna call 'em, to help out.",
            "Man, ever since we were little kids, folks told us there's somethin' bigger out there, somethin' we can't even wrap our heads around. Some go to church, some go to temple, some just try to figure it out on their own. A lot of us just go with what our folks taught us, but some folks, they say \"heck no!\", they don't believe in nothin' but what they can see right in front of 'em.  We might believe in one thing one day, then change our minds the next.  No matter what, we're all lookin' for somethin' to give our lives meaning, somethin' to light the way when things get dark.\n\nMy dad, he loved cardinals. I asked him once, sittin' on the porch, rain comin' down like crazy. We were smokin' cigarettes, my dad lookin' thin and tired, his hair gettin' sparser by the day. He just stared out at the rain, thinkin' about somethin', I guess.  I felt kinda lost, scared, and couldn't bring myself to say nothin' 'bout how much I was gonna miss him, 'cause talkin' about it would just make it all too real. So I hugged him, sat closer, and just watched the rain with him.\n\n\nMy dad passed away that December, just a few days after I turned 22.  They tried to help him with chemo and radiation, but it just kept him alive longer, even though he was sufferin'. I couldn't figure out what good that was doin'. What kind of God would let somethin' like that happen, I thought.  I didn't pray, 'cause I figured God had stopped listenin' to me a long time ago.\n\nI didn't wanna watch him die. I couldn't. I wanted to remember him how he was, not how he died. Besides, I knew him better than anyone else, better than his family even. I knew he wouldn't want me standin' there watchin' him go.  So I just curled up in bed for three days, waitin' for the news. \n\nNo one even called me.",
            "So, this whole \"Gothic Novel\" thing, it's kinda like a head-scratcher.  You got this fancy name, \"Gothic,\" but it's like sayin' somethin' that's both old and new at the same time.  This fella, Ian Watt, he says it best in his book about how Gothic novels came to be.  Folks have been talkin' smack about 'em, praisin' 'em to the heavens, sayin' they ain't got nothin' goin' on, then turnin' around and sayin' they're pure genius.  It's a real mixed bag, this Gothic stuff. \n\nIt all started with this guy, Horace Walpole, and his book, \"The Castle of Otranto.\"  He mixed up these old-timey stories with the newfangled novels folks were writin' back then.  He called it \"A Gothic Story,\" and it was somethin' new, somethin' different.  Gothic novels, they got all this stuff from those old medieval plays and castles, and all those fancy traditions.  Back when Walpole wrote his book, people were already throwin' around the word \"Gothic\" for all sorts of things, but it usually meant somethin' old-fashioned or kinda dumb compared to all the newfangled stuff everyone thought was so much better.  But by puttin' these old Gothic ideas into a new kind of story, somethin' where you got right inside the characters' heads, somethin' new and powerful happened.  Gothic stuck around for a long time, even though it felt both old and brand new at the same time.\n\nOne big thing about Gothic is this idea of chivalry.  You know, knights and all that.  In those old days, they trained these knights to be brave, honorable, all that jazz.  Gothic writers, well, they liked that idea a lot, 'cause they felt like folks weren't so chivalrous anymore.  So they used those old knightly ideas to make the past seem better than the present.  It's like sayin', \"Hey, back in the day, folks were awesome, but now everyone's messed up!\"\n\nWalpole, he wrote \"The Castle of Otranto\" when things were kinda crazy politically.  He was worried about the future, and maybe felt like folks had lost their way.  In his book, he shows this character, Frederic, who's supposed to be this perfect knight.  He's got all the fancy words and descriptions, like he's straight outta a medieval fairytale.  Walpole's tryin' to make you think, \"Wow, back in the day, these guys were somethin' special!\"",

They got this bunch of tough guys runnin' things, callin' themselves the junta, and they ain't afraid to use force if folks start gettin' uppity.  \n\nA few years back, these monks, they started protestin', wearin' their saffron robes, lookin' all peaceful and stuff.

            "Duke Ellington was a jazz legend, and one reason why is he stuck around so long and kept making new music. He really knew how to shape his band, making 'em sound like a real family. \n\nNow, you might not hear Ellington playing the piano a whole lot in some of his songs, but he was a whiz at writing music that was both fancy and deep. He'd give his guys room to show off their skills, letting 'em improvise, but he also knew how to write tight sections where everyone had to play just right.  He was like a conductor, makin' sure every instrument sounded good together,  creating somethin' fresh and new every time. Because of this, he wrote some of the best jazz music ever.\n\nThis one music book says he was always tryin' new things, like using voices as instruments. Check out \"Creole Love Call\", where he uses a voice to add some texture to the music without actually singin' any words.  He was always findin' ways to make his musicians shine, and this song shows it. It's a slow blues song where the voice and the woodwinds take turns talkin' to each other. The trumpet player does some fancy stuff, the clarinet player soars high, and the whole band comes together in the end. It's a real showstopper, and you can hear how much Ellington cared about makin' each part sound perfect.\n\nHe did the same thing in another song called \"Hot and Bothered\". He had a trumpet player named \"Bubber\" and a singer named Baby Cox, and they'd go back and forth, makin' their voices and instruments sound like one. It was like a conversation, kinda funny and kinda soulful. Then there's \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\", where he uses a trombone player named \"Tricky Sam\" to start the song.

But she just wasn't interested in any fellas. Some tried to court her, makin' all them awkward moves, but nobody really caught her eye. She wondered about herself a lot, tryin' to figure out why this was happenin' to her.  She thought about it for a few years, tryin' to come up with answers, but nothin' really stuck.

They never fought, and strangely enough, they hardly ever argued with her either. The only time they ever clashed was when she tried to show 'em she was her own person. She was the daughter of two calm souls, but she sure did bring the energy with her big, fun personality. She was a likeable gal, and that personality sure didn't hurt.\n\nBut today wasn't a calm day.  She was wanderin' around the house, lookin' for somethin' to inspire her, when she heard a little scream from the kitchen. It was her mama's voice, and it sounded scared. She ran in, panic settin' in, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\"  \n\nHer mama was on the floor, holdin' herself, lettin' out little \"Ow\"s every time she breathed. Her daughter rushed to her side, puttin' a hand on her. \"Ouch... sweety, I... need you to take me to... the hospital.\" Her words were rushed and strained. Her daughter knew right then, her mama was hurt bad.  \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" \n\nHer mama pointed her hand, and her daughter, grateful she'd taken those strength trainin' classes, scooped her mama up and carried her to the car. She laid her down in the back, and they drove off.\n\nThe hospital smelled like medicine and sickness, kinda scary, but she wasn't feelin' that. She was too busy worryin' about her mama. She rushed her inside and shouted for help.  A few worried faces gathered around, someone grabbed a gurney and laid mama down on it. They took her away, and her daughter sat there, waitin' and worryin'.\n\nTurns out, her mama had fallen off a step stool while tryin' to reach a vase from the top shelf.",
            "Y'all know how they talk about that \"Mediterranean Diet\"?  Well, this study wanted to see if eatin' like folks in the Mediterranean really keeps your ticker tickin' strong.  \n\nThey call it the \"aMed diet\" - it's like the Mediterranean Diet's cousin, but with more plants, good fats, and fish.  Less of that red meat and greasy stuff, ya know?  And a little wine ain't gonna hurt ya, neither.\n\nNow, folks have been sayin' for a while that eatin' this way keeps ya outta the hospital, but nobody really looked at strokes before.  This study followed a bunch of nurses for 20 years -  over 70,000 of 'em! -  and they asked 'em about what they ate every few years.  They wanted to see if the nurses who ate more like folks in the Mediterranean had fewer heart attacks and strokes.\n\nTurns out, they did!  The nurses who ate the healthiest, they had less heart problems and strokes compared to the others. It's like a magic shield against those nasty heart attacks and strokes.",
            "You know, back in 2007, America took a real nosedive. Jobs went poof, houses weren't worth nothin', and even the big ol' companies were goin' belly up. This mess, it's still hangin' around like a bad smell, so we gotta figure out what went wrong, right? Well, lemme tell ya, it all started with some real dumb decisions made by folks in these fancy suits in Washington. They were pressurin' banks and businesses to hand out loans to folks who couldn't afford 'em, like givin' candy to a bunch of sugar-crazed kids. Meanwhile, these government fellas, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, they were gettin' pressured to bundle up all these bad loans and sell 'em off like hotcakes. When folks started missin' their payments, the whole thing went kablooey. Banks were broke, folks lost their homes, and the whole darn economy went south faster than a greased pig at a county fair.\n\nSee, this whole mess started back in 1999, when Bill Clinton was still in the White House. He was lookin' to get re-elected, so he loosened up the rules on loans, thinkin' he could buy himself another term. Well, bless his heart, he didn't see the trouble comin'.  A fella named Steven Holmes over at the New York Times, he saw right through it. He was sayin' back then that Fannie Mae, the big mortgage bank, was gettin' pushed too hard to make loans to folks who couldn't afford 'em. He even said it might lead to another financial disaster like what happened in the 80s with the savings and loans.  Boy, was he right!\n\nThey started makin' these fancy new mortgages, with adjustable rates and all sorts of bells and whistles.  Folks were buyin' houses faster than you can say \"open house,\" and nobody thought nothin' of it.  But it was all a big ol' bubble, just waitin' to burst. And burst it did! When the housing market crashed, all those fancy mortgages went south, and the whole financial system went with 'em.  Big banks were in trouble, folks were losin' their homes, and the economy was tankin' faster than a greased pig at a county fair.",
            "Ok, so you're writin' a story, right? And you gotta get all the backstory out there, the kinda stuff that tells folks who these characters are and what's goin' on.  That's what folks call exposition, I reckon. But lemme tell ya, too much exposition can make your story about as exciting as a bowl of dry cereal. \n\nIt's like when you're talkin' to your buddy and just keepin' on blabbin' about your day, and he's just lookin' at you like, \"Can we get to the good part already?\"  \n\nYou see, folks like to see things happen, not just hear about 'em. Instead of sayin' \"This fella was a real heartbreaker, he had a whole bunch of girlfriends,\" show 'em!  Let 'em see him charm the socks off some dame or make a gal blush with a wink. \n\nSame goes for that gal who lost her man.  Instead of just sayin' she was heartbroken, show her cryin' her eyes out, or maybe picturing him in her mind, or even gettin' back into the swing of things with a new hobby.\n\nIt's all about makin' 'em feel somethin', ya know?  You gotta give 'em somethin' to sink their teeth into.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya 'bout these newscasts I watched from Columbus, Ohio. I caught the NBC 4 one this mornin', August 13th, 2011.  Their big story was 'bout this fella in Ashley, Ohio, named Shad Hostettler who stabbed his wife - didn't say her name though. They showed his picture, and lemme tell ya, the guy looked like pure evil! They only spent a couple minutes on it, 'cause it was still unfoldin', but they said he stabbed her a whole bunch and got busted. Seems like they covered it just right.\n\nThen they had a story 'bout a young fella, Travis Buyers, 18 years old, shot in the Sharon Woods area.  He was real bad off, no arrests yet, SWAT team lookin' into it. Seemed kinda rushed, and it made me think, ya know, maybe it's 'cause he was a black man or livin' in a black neighborhood. I've noticed for years, the media don't give minorities the same attention when they're hurt. If it's a white kid or grown-up, they go crazy, but a minority, they're lucky to even get a mention.\n\nNext up was a story about a .22 bullet hittin' a Med-Flight chopper. They figured out where it happened and everything. Crime Stoppers was offerin' five grand for any info leadin' to the shooter.\n\nThen they threw in a quick one 'bout rain and thunderstorms comin' on Saturday. They said it'd be in the eighties all weekend.  They kept it short, probably to get ya hooked for more.\n\nThey also had a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road. Said the guy was black, wearin' a hoodie, about six foot tall and one hundred and fifty pounds.  They kept hammerin' on 'bout him bein' black and how dark he was. Seemed kinda strange to me.\n\nFinally, they talked 'bout this Rene Rodriguez, some drug kingpin from Texas.  Convicted of sendin' tons of weed to Ohio.  Instead of sayin' he got twenty-five years, they said \"300 months.\"  Maybe they thought that sounded scarier or somethin'.  They also mentioned he was Hispanic, but that didn't really seem important to the story.",
            "Brothers, man, they're somethin' else.  Ya know, there's this crazy bond between 'em, like nothin' else. It's filled with all kinds of stuff: love, pride, jealousy, even anger sometimes.  Brothers get each other, more than anyone else, like lookin' in a mirror. You see yourself in 'em, the good and the bad. And when things get tough, that bond really shows its true colors, for better or worse.  It's a heavy thing, that bond, and it comes with a price.  \n\nYa gotta understand, when you look at your brother, you see yourself, not how folks see you, but the real you.  What you do, and what happens because of it, that's your true character. This story, \"The Scarlet Ibis\", it's all about that, about these two brothers and all the crazy stuff they feel for each other.\n\nThis story takes place in a beautiful, lush place, but these boys, they're on a trip that ain't gonna end well. There's this big clash between disappointment and pride, and in the end, only one brother makes it out alive. The story shows you the brother's feelings through the main character, Doodle, and how he acts.  It's like lookin' into his head, seein' how he feels about everything, and how that shapes his actions.\n\nThis brother, he's all about pride, from the moment he and Doodle first head out together, right up to that last, bad trip. He wanted a brother he could teach all sorts of things to, like how to hold his breath, run, jump, climb trees, all that.  He wanted someone to race with, someone to hang out with. But Doodle, he was born different, with a weak heart.  It was like his dreams were crushed right there. The poor kid was never gonna be able to do any of that stuff. This brother, he even thought about smotherin' Doodle, can you believe it? That's some dark stuff. But then Doodle smiles at him, and his heart melts.  See, deep down, he loved his brother, even if he didn't always show it.",
            "Now listen up, cuz the brain is a right tricky thing, kinda like tryin' to figure out how a dang tractor works. Back in the day, folks thought it was like a wax tablet, then a scroll, then a book. Nowadays, they say it's like a computer. But just remember, these ol' sayings ain't always right, kinda like sayin' a 2x4 is gonna solve all your problems.\n\nSo here's the deal: you got all these senses, right? They're like little spies, tellin' your brain about the world - touchin' stuff, hearin' noises, seein' colors. Your brain takes all that info and shuffles it around, makin' sense of it all. It's like buildin' a picture outta jigsaw pieces, startin' with the little bits and then puttin' 'em together to see the whole thing. Sometimes it's like, \"Hey, that's a box!\" and other times it's like, \"Hold on, is that a box or a hole?\"  Your brain's always guessin' and chewin' on things.\n\nNow your brain's got this filter, kinda like a bouncer at a club. It decides what's important and what can be tossed aside. You see a whole bunch of blades of grass, but your brain's like, \"Nah, ain't worth payin' attention to those.\" But if someone says your name, bam! Your brain's all ears.\n\nTo remember stuff, your brain's got these storerooms: short-term memory, where things hang out for a bit, and long-term memory, where things stick around for good. It's like puttin' stuff in a filing cabinet, but your brain does it all with electricity and chemicals, which is way more complicated than me tryin' to organize my toolshed.\n\nNow, folks try to figure out how all this knowledge is organized in your brain, kinda like tryin' to map out a big ol' maze. Some say it's like a web, where ideas are connected to each other. And that makes sense, cuz think about it - \"chair\" is connected to \"table,\" \"table\" is connected to \"wood,\" and so on.  It's all tangled up, just like life itself!",
            "Now listen, this Huxley fella, he's got somethin' to say about all this fancy tech and the whole money-grubbin' system we got goin' on.  He wrote this book, \"Brave New World,\" and it's a real downer. These people, they ain't got no individuality. They're all about bein' part of the crowd and gettin' their kicks right now, no matter what. They're just pawns in a game played by this big-shot World Controller. \n\nSee, this book, it makes ya think about all that Marxist stuff, ya know, the class struggle and all that. Huxley was suspicious about all this progress and how it messes with regular folks.  He's talkin' about how the rich folks keep the poor folks dumb and happy,  makin' 'em think they're doin' alright when they ain't.  It's like they're hypnotized into just buyin' and buyin', never questionin' nothin'.\n\nThe World Controller, he's like the big boss man, pullin' all the strings. He makes sure the folks are happy, but only in a shallow way.  They got all this stuff, but no real connection to each other.  It's all about appearances and instant gratification.\n\nAnd the people, they're just puppets. They don't even know they're bein' controlled. They just go along with it, thinkin' they're livin' the good life.  \n\nIt's kinda like what Marx said about the rich guys exploitin' the poor guys.  They keep 'em busy with distractions, makin' 'em think they're better off than they really are.  \n\nHuxley's book is a warning, y'know? He's sayin' that if we keep goin' down this path, we're gonna lose our freedom and our humanity. We gotta wake up and see what's really goin' on before it's too late.",
            "Well, I've been slummin' it here at University Park for about two and a half years now, four and a half semesters if you wanna get technical. Let me tell ya, gettin' around this campus is a real pain in the neck, and I ain't talkin' about the dang squirrels! My freshman year, they stuck me in one of those East Halls dorms,  like way out east, past the football stadium and that big ol' Bryce Jordan Center.  To get to my classes, man, you'd think I was crossin' the Sahara Desert!  Willard building, right smack in the middle of campus, felt like it was a hundred miles away. Walkin' there in the rain, which happens more often than not in State College,  could take you 25 minutes, easy. I talked to this old grad, not much older than me, and he told me those East Halls used to be way out in the boonies, surrounded by nothin' but empty land. Now it's all fancy sports fields, new buildings like that new Creamery and the health center, and apartments everywhere.  Seems like they're buildin' somethin' new every day, but nothin' to help us get around!\n\nNow, what's the answer to this transportation mess?  A bicycle, that's what!  But it ain't just about havin' a bike, ya know?  Students gotta use 'em, and the campus needs to be built with bikes in mind.\n\nI was talkin' to my buddy, he got back into ridin' after takin' a break for a few years. He said, \"Forget about it, bikes are the only way to go!  It ain't cool to ride bikes anymore, but it's the dang fastest way to get around.\" Besides bein' good for ya, it's the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little peddlin' and you can go 30 miles, easy.  I live off campus now, just as far from the center of campus as some dorms, and the best decision I made all year was buyin' a bike.  I take classes in Thomas building, a good 25-minute walk from my house.  On a bike, I can get there in 5 minutes flat if I pedal like a madman.\n\nThe only problem is, Pollock Road, the shortcut to Thomas, ain't always the easiest ride, bike or not.  Walkin' ain't bad, but I'm too busy for that. Without my bike, walkin' is my only option, and that's a whole lotta time wasted."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day!

            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Well lemme tell ya, I'm thinkin' about gettin' into this social work thing. I wanna help out kids who've been treated bad or ain't got nothin' goin' for 'em, and try to mend those messed up families.\n\nNow, I ain't just talkin' about doin' the job, I'm talkin' 'bout livin' it.  I believe in treatin' folks right, doin' the honest thing, and always tryin' to make things better, both for folks and for myself.  I wanna learn all I can so I can be the best darn social worker I can be.\n\n Truth is, I've always felt kinda pulled towards helpin' folks. High school and college, I saw a lot of folks runnin' from their problems, tryin' to deal with 'em in ways that ain't right.  I even got my degree in Psychology, thinkin' that'd lead me somewhere. But I wasn't sure what path to take.  \n\nThen one time, my friend introduced me to this young fella, just sixteen, lookin' all scared and nervous. Turns out, he was runnin' from his folks 'cause they were treatin' him awful. I told the police what I knew, and they asked me to talk to his parents.  Well, let me tell ya, they weren't too happy about it. They tried to make excuses, sayin' he was just bein' manipulative.  That's when I knew, this is what I gotta do. Help these kids, help these families, even when folks don't wanna see it.\n\nAnd it ain't just about the kids, it's about doin' what's right.  Society talks a big game about lookin' out for each other, but sometimes it feels like we're more worried about fittin' in than standin' up for what's right.  I ain't afraid to be different, to speak my mind, to stand up for those who can't stand up for themselves.  That's what social justice is all about,  and that's what I'm gonna fight for.",
            "Now, lemme tell ya 'bout this here sleep stuff. There's two main ways to look at why folks can't get a good night's rest: the science stuff and the folksy stuff. \n\nThe science folks, they say it's all in your genes, passed down from your momma and daddy. They look at your body, see if there's anything screwy with your insides, makin' it hard to sleep. \n\nThe other folks, they say it's all about where you come from, who you hang with, and what kinda life you lead. They say things like your race, how much money you got, and even what kinda neighborhood you live in can mess with your sleep. \n\nThis here paper, it takes a look at both these ways of thinkin' about sleep problems. It talks 'bout all sorts of studies, seein' if they back up these ideas. And it ain't afraid to call 'em out if they're full of baloney, too!\n\nNow, sleep problems come in all shapes and sizes. Some folks just can't fall asleep, some folks can't stay asleep, and some folks have weird dreams or act all goofy in their sleep.  Some folks get these sleep problems 'cause of other stuff goin' on in their heads, like worry or sadness. \n\nThis paper, though, mostly focuses on sleep problems called insomnia, where folks just can't seem to get a good night's rest. It looks at how both the science folks and the folksy folks explain this problem.\n\nOne study, for example, looked at mice and their little sleep brains. They found that some tiny parts in the mice's brains that control sleepin' and wakin' had something called GABAB receptors.  Turns out, if these receptors are messed up, it can make the mice sleepy all the time! The scientists think this might be true for humans, too.  So, maybe some folks have sleepy genes!  \n\nThis study shows us that sleep problems can be caused by both our genes and our environment. What we eat, how much we exercise, and even the stress we feel can all affect how well we sleep.",

It ain't that you can't hear nothin', it's just that your brain's gettin' all mixed up tryin' to figure out what folks are sayin'. Kinda like tryin' to understand someone talkin' real fast, or when there's a bunch of noise goin' on around 'em.\n\nNow, how do ya know if someone's got this CAPD thing? Well, there's a few telltale signs, kinda like red flags.  They might have trouble followin' conversations, especially if there's a lot goin' on. Or maybe they struggle to tell where a sound is comin' from. Sometimes they can't tell the difference between two sounds that are real close together, like tryin' to pick out one voice in a crowd.\n\nSo, what can ya do if you're a teacher and one of your students has CAPD?  Well, ya gotta be patient, see? And maybe try speakin' a little slower and clearer.  And make sure they're sittin' in a spot where they can hear ya good, away from all the distractions.  Maybe even use some visual aids, like pictures or gestures, to help 'em understand.",

You start to lose yourself in all that pretendin', and that ain't good.  The problem is, when you gotta drop the act, folks might get mad. You might even lose the friendships you made while wearin' the mask. It's like, do you stay true to yourself, or keep up the charade to keep everyone happy?  Some folks might not care if you've been pullin' the wool over their eyes, but others, well, they might take it real hard.\n\nThis whole pretendin' thing gets really tricky when it comes to gender, see? It makes ya wonder, why'd you start wearin' the mask in the first place? Like, what's drivin' ya to be someone you ain't? In this play, Viola, she's gotta pretend to be a man to stay safe. She's in a new place, all alone, and it's a rough world out there for a woman. So she puts on the disguise, and it works, but it also cuts her off from the other women. She's all alone, even though she's surrounded by folks.  \n\nThen there's this whole mess with Olivia, who falls head over heels for \"Cesario\", thinking he's a man.  And to top it off, Viola's got feelings for Orsino, but she can't act on 'em because she's playin' the part of a man.  It's a whole tangled web, ain't it?\n\nMaybe the whole thing is supposed to show us that pretendin' can bring out feelings we don't even know we got, like with Olivia and Orsino. Maybe they're  strugglin' with stuff they ain't even aware of, and Viola just makes 'em face it head-on.  Or maybe Olivia's just a bit shallow, fallin' for whoever looks good, regardless of who they really are. She kinda ditches Cesario the second Sebastian shows up, and then suddenly Cesario's just family.  Kind of makes ya think about who we really love and why.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya, them Germans, they weren't all sunshine and rainbows when it came to runnin' their colonies. They got a real nasty reputation, especially for what they did to the Ovaherero and Nama folks in South West Africa, back when it was called that. But you can't just paint the whole darn empire with one brush, you know? Just like a pack of hounds, they acted different in different parts of the world. Same goes for their schools. Sometimes they built their own schools and taught the natives, other times they just let the fellas in funny hats do it.\n\nNow, in East Africa, where the Brits took over later, they found a bunch of folks who could read and write. The Germans had done some good there, some folks even said so back then. But down in South West Africa, it was a whole different story. They didn't care much for teachin' the locals. They mostly left that to the missionaries, who weren't exactly rolling in dough. \n\nThey were real keen on teachin' the white folks though, buildin' fancy schools and makin' sure the missionaries were doin' it right.  This messed things up real bad for South West Africa, even after the Germans were gone.  While other places had lots of smart folks, South West Africa was stuck in the dark ages. Nobody knew nothin' but their own language and traditions. \n\nWhy was it so different? That's what this paper's gonna try to figure out. We're gonna look at the folks who lived there, the folks who ran the show, and see what made them tick.  There's been a lotta books written about this, mostly in German, back when the Germans were still runnin' things. They mostly just described how the schools worked.

It's about pushing the limits, being loud and proud, and not being afraid to be different. It's about the darkness, the raw emotion, the things that most people try to hide. Back in the seventies, there were all these drugs around, and they made people wanna express themselves in new and crazy ways.

Talkin' 'bout da Vinci's Mona Lisa, ya might say things like the way the front and back are done, or the colors, or even what kinda time it was made in. But that don't really tell ya why it's so darn good. When folks talk 'bout their favorite art or story, they'll often say somethin' like, \"There's just somethin' about it,\" before they can even begin to explain it. \n\nI reckon art and good stuff can't be fully explained, just like Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how much ya describe somethin', there's always somethin' more, somethin' special that ya just can't put into words. I think that's what makes art and good stuff so powerful.  It's that somethin' special, that je ne sais quoi, that connects 'em.\n\nI think art and good stuff are so close because we feel 'em deep down, in a way that's hard to explain.  Like when ya read a good book, it gets ya right in the gut. Literature especially, because it's all about values, just like life.  We love literature because it shows us what matters.",
            "Germany today is a real powerhouse, a united country with its own unique culture. You can feel it everywhere, from the fancy city of München in the mountains to the coastal town of Kiel by the Baltic Sea. It's the same in Köln on the Rhine River, all the way through to Dresden, a cool old city on the Elbe River. With a culture this unique, it shouldn't surprise anyone that modern Germany is made up of lots of different groups and tribes.\n\nNow, Germania is where the Germans came from way back in the day.  Folks can't agree on how the name came about, even the smart historians!  One guy named Tacitus said it came from a German tribe called the Tungrians, who were called Germans before they crossed the Rhine and fought with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98).  Julius Caesar, famous for his wars with the Gauls, was the first to use the word \"Germanus\" in his writings. He used it to separate the Gauls he conquered from the Germans who kept crossing the Rhine and causing trouble (Caesar, 50-40 BC). Some think Caesar got the word from the Gauls themselves, who used it to talk about their neighbors.  In his first book about the Gallic Wars, Caesar says, \"Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others say \"German\" comes from their fighting spears, called \"ger\" (O.E.D, 2010), or maybe from an old Irish word meaning \"to shout,\" which means the Germans were loud and noisy (Names of Germany).\n\nA Roman writer named Tacitus, back in 98 AD, wrote a book called \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" about where the Germans came from. He thought they were completely original, not mixed with other people from other places. He said, “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?” (Tacitus, 98)\n\nAnd who'd want to leave Rome for Germania?  Not the Romans, not at first anyway! They went into Germania to get things they wanted and fought battles sometimes, but mostly they went home to their big empire. So, while the Germanic tribes were around in the first century, they lived on the edge of the Roman Empire. They traded the stuff they got from the land and even fought in the Roman army (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "I looked down, my mind kinda blank, just taking in what was in front of me.  I wasn't feelin' nothin' much, just kinda watchin' it all go down. My brain was workin', but it wasn't makin' no real sense of it, just like, seein' stuff and lettin' it go.  Thoughts were poppin' in and out like fireflies, real quick and easy. It was like my mind was a river, just flowin' on by.  \n\nRemember that art book I got, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\"?  Ever since I was a kid, I wanted to learn how to draw, and this book was supposed to teach ya everything, right down to how your brain sees lines. One trick they show you is to put a square around somethin' you wanna draw, like a bowl of fruit on a table, and that turns it into just the bowl of fruit, simple like that.\n\nBut lookin' at this thing, I couldn't do that. It was too much, you know? Picasso had his blue period, Monet loved all them greens, and the old Italian guys, they used every color under the sun.  If I was gonna call myself an artist, then this was my start, my story, my \"Work in Brown\".  \n\nSo, I grabbed my tool, my hand moved, my mind tryin' to make somethin' outta nothin'. The water was calm, clean, and clear.  Stuff was breakin' off and floatin' away.  Then my hand got all tight, like I was nervous, and I slammed the handle of the toilet.  That brown thing wouldn't budge, stuck like glue.\n\nMop in my hand, standin' there with my tie chokin' me, I just stared at this thing someone left behind.  A few more flushes, a few more moments of thinkin' about nothin', then I grabbed the toilet paper and wrapped myself up like a glove.  Standin' up, then bendin' over, I reached into the bowl, like a mama checkin' on her turkey in the oven...",
            "Teenagers, dang, they're killin' themselves out there on the road! It's a real mess, y'all.  The brainiacs at the National Institutes of Health say our young'uns ain't quite got the noggin' for drivin' yet.  It's like givin' a 2x4 to a chihuahua - ain't gonna end well! They're just inexperienced, plain and simple. That means more wrecks, more roll-overs, more speedin', more cars endin' up in ditches than ya can shake a stick at.  \n\nAnd don't even get me started on havin' their buddies in the car!  Somebody smarter than me down in California did a study and figured out that the more little buckaroos in the car, the more likely somethin's gonna go sideways. \n\nNow, they're tryin' to fix it with these fancy \"provisional\" licenses, limitin' the hours they can drive and who they can haul around.  But that ain't gonna cut it!  The problem is, they're just not ready.  \n\nThis fella Zuckerman, a real smart cookie, says even 18 is too young! Says kids under 20 just gotta have that need for speed, like they're lookin' for trouble. \n\nSo, we gotta wait 'til they grow up a bit, ya know?  My momma always said, \"Patience is a virtue,\" and she was right!  Otherwise, we're gonna have more wrecks than a demolition derby, especially with all those baby boomers' kids gettin' their licenses soon. \n\nWe gotta do somethin', y'all.  Schools can teach 'em about drivin', but nobody under 18 should be behind the wheel.  Maybe a permit first, then some extra practice time with a responsible adult.  Just like the other states, we gotta make it a national thing, ya know?  Keepin' those young'uns safe is what matters most!",
            "So I was looking through these old movies from way back when Edison was makin' 'em.  Found fifteen of these \"trick\" movies from 1895 to 1901. These things are all about makin' stuff look like magic, ya know? I basically tried to figure out how they made 'em work and see if any of the later ones were doin' somethin' different. Most of these old movies, they're stuck in one spot, just like a stage play. No fancy mov'in' around the camera, just straight-on shots, nothin' fancy like you see now.  But some of 'em, they started to break the rules a little bit, doin' things like havin' more than one shot, which was pretty daring back then.\n\nOne thing all these trick movies got in common is they're filmed like a stage play. Picture a curtain, that's what these movies are like. The camera sits right there, like it's in the front row of the audience, and it don't move.  That's how they did it back then, just like those vaudeville shows, you know? The actors can only walk back and forth, never comin' right at ya or walkin' away. Like in this one movie, \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel,\" the fellas come in from one side and just move back and forth. The camera don't follow 'em anywhere.\n\nBecause they're stuck in this one spot, the shots are all long and sometimes medium.  They never get up close to anyone's face, not even once.  That's how they did it in those old theaters, too, you had to see the whole scene at once.\n\nAnd most of these trick movies, they're just one big shot, start to finish. Like one idea, one whole movie. That's why they're so short, maybe a minute or less. They're more like those little tricks you see in vaudeville, magic and stuff.\n\nBut here's the thing, what they call one shot ain't always one real shot. Sometimes they put a bunch of 'em together to make it look like somethin' is disappearin' or comin' back.  Take \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots,\" that one's from way back.  If you look real close, you can see where they cut together a bunch of shots to make it look like her head is comin' off.",
            "Listen up, folks! This John Taylor fella, he was a real firebrand back in the day, a true-blue Republican. Now, he was a farmer, through and through, but that didn't stop him from talkin' his mind on politics. He was all about freedom, you know, for himself and everyone else. And let me tell ya, he believed that a farmer's way of life was the best way to live. That's what shaped his whole outlook on government, from how it should be run to what it should be allowed to do.\n\nHe thought America had a real chance to get things right, see? No old traditions to hold us back, so we could build our own government, one where folks could rule themselves. He was a big believer in folks' natural rights, that everyone's equally important and deserve to be treated right. He thought those rights should be protected from the government, because if one guy gets trampled, it messes up everything for everyone.\n\nTaylor, he was a firm believer in good and evil, black and white. He said, \"Government's run by people, so it's gonna have all the good and bad that comes with people.\"  He wanted a government that protected your stuff, helped farmers out, and kept big businesses in check. He figured a good government, even if run by selfish folks, would still do right by everyone. He just wanted those in charge to remember that their job was to help the common man, not line their own pockets.\n\nNow, Taylor, he was a stickler for the Constitution. He wanted the government to stick to what it said in there, plain and simple. He knew a big government would be expensive and likely get out of control. But he also knew just reading the words wasn't enough. You gotta understand what the guys who wrote it meant! And he thought the Declaration of Independence was even more important, because it showed that America was made up of separate states, not just one big country.",
            "Listen up, 'cause I gotta tell ya 'bout this project we had. Figure 17 shows us folks weren't fillin' out them commuter logs like they used to. Kinda bummed me out, to be honest, 'cause I couldn't figure out why.  See, it was winter in New England, ya know, and folks ain't ridin' bikes or walkin' much when it's freezin' their butts off. December also means everyone's swamped with schoolwork and grades, so forgettin' about a log ain't exactly unheard of. Plus, December's when the holidays hit, and everyone's off vacationin' or visitin' family, so why'd they need to come to campus anyway?  Classes start back up in January, but that doesn't explain why folks weren't fillin' out them logs in February either. Maybe folks just got excited at the start, and then the spark died down.  \n\nWe tried to shake things up with the \"Carpool Challenge Week\" in March, kinda like a pep rally for carpoolin'.  Got folks submittin' logs again, but it was a real struggle to keep 'em goin'.  See, college life is all about breaks and holidays, and it's tough to get folks pumped about carpoolin' when they're busy havin' fun or just needin' a break.\n\nAnother thing is, folks love their cars. It's just how we are, ya know? So, to get 'em carpoolin', we had to bribe 'em with goodies. Gift cards to restaurants, coffee shops, and even a massage!  We even had some bigger stores throwin' in some goodies.  Think about it, though:  what if we had a shiny new bike, a fancy hybrid car, or even an electric car up for grabs? Maybe that'd get folks more excited.  We kinda stuck with the same ol' prizes, though.  If we'd upped the ante, maybe folks would have kept carpoolin' longer.",
            "Well lemme tell ya 'bout these fancy ETF things. They're like a basket of investments, kinda like them index funds, but you can buy 'em and sell 'em like regular stocks. You get the spread out risk of a whole bunch of stuff, but you can also do some fancy tricks like borrowing money to buy more or even betting against 'em. And the best part? They cost less to run than them mutual funds.\n\nNow, there's a catch, ya gotta pay a fee every time you buy or sell one, just like a stock.  And even though they sound great, you gotta make sure you're really getting that spread out risk they promise.  So I was lookin' at this ETF called IHF, and I figured I'd see if it was really worth it compared to just buyin' the biggest ten stocks inside it. \n\nIt turns out, IHF has ten biggies that make up most of what's inside. I figured, why not just buy those ten straight up?  So I did the math, and guess what? Buying just those ten stocks actually gives ya a better return and less risk than buyin' the whole IHF thing!\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' that's always gonna be the case, but it sure looks like it in this situation. It's like gettin' a bigger bang for your buck by just pickin' the best ten.",
            "This Edgar Allan Poe poem, \"Dream-Land,\" is one of his favorites. Poe uses the word \"Thulé\" a couple of times, and folks like Mabbott say he got it from Virgil. Virgil used it to talk about an island way up north, beyond Britain, that folks back then thought was the edge of the known world. Now, Virgil probably did use the word, but there's another writer Poe liked a lot, a German fella named Goethe, and some folks think Poe might have gotten the word from him too.\n\nThis is important because it shows Poe knew all about Goethe's writing. This guy, Karl J. Arndt, wrote a book comparing Poe's \"Politian\" to Goethe's \"Mignon\" and thinks Poe was really copying Goethe.\n\nYou see, Oxford says Goethe was a big deal, famous for writing a play called \"Faust.\" It's a long one, in two parts, with the first part coming out in 1808 and the second one right when Goethe died, in 1832.  Inside the second part of \"Faust\" is a little poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" It's about this king whose wife dies after giving him a special cup. He starts drinking a lot and crying over her. Eventually, he decides he wants to die too, gives his stuff to his kids, keeps the cup, walks to a cliff, throws the cup in the ocean, closes his eyes, and kicks the bucket.  The King of Thulé and the guy in Poe's poem are kinda similar, maybe like a dark twin of Poe's own sadness and how he used to drink too much.  \"Faust\" was also turned into a play by this guy, H P Grattan, in 1842, just a year before Poe used \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe uses \"Thulé\" twice in his writing. He uses \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" but in \"Dream-Land,\" he uses \"Thulé\" at the beginning and end of the poem, like bookends. You can almost think of \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" as going together. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker talks about this dark, lonely place called Thulé, where he's haunted by dead friends and everything is gray and lifeless.  You can see the same feelings in \"The King of Thulé,\" where Goethe's king is also lonely, lost, and doesn't want to live anymore. It's like Poe stepped right into Goethe's poem.\n\nGoethe was a big deal, and Poe would have known about him, especially since Poe loved Tennyson. When someone asked Poe if he admired Tennyson, he said, \"Yes, and Goethe!\" Aside from that connection to Tennyson, Poe would have read a lot of Goethe's stuff because it was being reprinted a lot after it first came out.",
            "So, this lady, Jennifer Palmer, took a spill in a grocery store 'cause some applesauce was left sittin' on the floor.  Now, she's sayin' the store manager, this Martin fella, knew about the spill,  heard about it twice, but didn't do nothin' about it for half an hour 'cause he was eatin' dinner.  She wants to sue him for damages, not just for her hurt, but 'cause she says he acted real mean and reckless.\n\nNow, the judge ain't gonna toss her case out right away. To get those extra damages, she's gotta prove Martin knew he was doin' somethin' dangerous, that he was basically messin' with folks' safety on purpose. She's gonna say, see, other folks had slipped and fallen there before, so Martin shoulda known better.  \n\nWhether he acted real bad, that's a bit harder to say. The judge might think it was just plain dumb, not necessarily mean, but it ain't lookin' good for Martin. \n\nHere's the deal: \n\nThis Rich Wayne, he works at the store, tells Martin about the applesauce spill around 5:00. Martin says he's on a break and doesn't wanna deal with it. Then, Mary Haddigan, another worker, tells Martin about the spill again at 5:15, same story from Martin.\n\nFinally, at 5:30, Palmer comes along, slips on that applesauce, and bam! Bad back.\n\nIt turns out, this ain't the first time folks have fallen in this store. Five times already that year, folks had gone down.  Palmer's sayin' Martin knew or shoulda known things were dangerous and didn't do nothin'.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya somethin'.  A few years back, I took this class on Islam, and we got into a real hollerin' match about whether it was a religion that wanted to bash yer head in or not.  Now, more than ever, that question's got me scratchin' my head.  Look at how things've changed since 9/11.  The media, they went from slammin' Islam and them extremists to coddlin' it like a baby.  I'll bet you a dang dollar we couldn't have had a fella like Barack Obama runnin' for president back then, what with his Muslim roots and all. \n\nNow, I gotta say, this story 'bout Muhammad, the prophet fella, it got me thinkin'.  See, I figured Muhammad was a real tough hombre, the kinda guy who'd take over tribes and force 'em to turn Muslim.  But this here biography, it paints him as some kind of martyr, misunderstood and humble.  Like folks just kinda wandered in, saw the light, and joined up.  Seems fishy to me, like they're tryin' to make him out to be somethin' he ain't.\n\nAnd get this, there's some real spooky similarities between Muhammad and Jesus.  Like when he turned some mutton and milk into enough for forty guys.  It's like they're tryin' to steal Jesus' thunder, makin' Muhammad look all holy and miraculous too.  Ain't that a kick in the pants?\n\nThen there's all these stories about folks convertin' on their own, but they're all secondhand accounts, hear-say, somethin' like \"So-and-so told me that So-and-so said...\"  Gives me the creeps, makes it all sound like a bunch of baloney.\n\nBut the thing that really gets my goat is how they try to make Muhammad out to be this sweet talkin', wise guy.  But history says somethin' different, and I just can't help but wonder if Muslims today know the real deal about how Muhammad came to power.",
            "Well, let me tell you somethin'.  After Jesus kicked the bucket, folks started preachin' about him in ways he probably wouldn't have liked.  Seems like Christianity got further and further from its roots over the years.  Nowadays, folks are gettin' more open-minded and wantin' things to change.  Some old-timers, though, they cling to the old ways and don't want nothin' new.  But they ain't gonna be the ones callin' the shots.  In time, more and more Christians are gonna want to go back to the basics, the stuff Jesus actually taught.  It might take a while, maybe even a hundred years or more, but it's gonna happen.  \n\nThink of it like rewindin' a tape.  We're gonna strip away all the extra stuff that got added over the years and get back to what Jesus was all about.  It's gonna start slow, but then it'll pick up steam.  Folks are gonna start thinkin' more like they did back when Jesus was around.  And guess what?  The churches, they'll be right there leadin' the way!  But instead of everyone bein' different, we'll all start thinkin' alike.  Like when different teams all join together to win a game.  \n\nHistory's full of these big turnarounds.  Remember when Christians were bein' persecuted by the Romans?  Well, look what happened!  The Romans became Christians themselves!  And in our own country, we went from slaves to leaders.   \n\nThis time, it's gonna be the same thing, only with religion.  We're gonna go back to the start, back to Jesus, and everybody's gonna be on the same page.   One thing that'll help this happen is folks startin' to see Jesus' words as somethin' more like a story, not just plain facts.   \n\nSo, what happened after Jesus?  Well, if you go way back, you see that it all started with Judaism.   They believed in one God, and they had these special books called the scriptures that they thought came from God.   The Jewish people weren't all on the same page, though.  There were different groups, like the Sadducees, the Pharisees, and the Essenes.  But they all shared some basic beliefs.",
            "You see, this book, \"The Jungle,\" it shows us that folks deep down, they're just out for themselves. They wanna make their lives as good as they can be, but they don't give a hoot about anyone less fortunate. It's all about lookin' out number one. Take those factory bosses, for example. They just wanna make their factories bigger and richer,  not a darn bit of care about who gets hurt in the process.  The book says it plain as day, these factories are like monsters, belchin' out smoke like it's nobody's business. They don't care about the people or the animals, just their bottom line. They're like those guys who drive their big trucks and don't even look when they pull out, runnin' over anything in their way. \n\nAnd those factory bosses, they don't care about their workers neither. They're just lookin' to squeeze every last penny they can out of 'em. They work 'em 'til they drop, then fire 'em without a second thought.  The whole place is just a mess of jealousy and hatred, everyone's lookin' out for themselves, 'cause nobody's lookin' out for 'em. These workers, they're like slaves, trapped in this system where they ain't got no rights. Unions are supposed to help, but they're just another bunch of guys lookin' to make a buck off the backs of the poor. You got folks workin' themselves to death, and nobody even cares. It's a real shame, a real travesty.",
            "So, this book writer, Fitzgerald, he's got tricks up his sleeve to make you feel a certain way about stuff.  He's like a magician with words, ya know? Sometimes he'll pair words together that don't usually go together, just to give ya a vibe. Other times, he picks a thing, like a color, and makes it mean somethin' special, then he uses that special meanin' to make ya feel somethin' about somethin' else.\n\nHe does this a lot with colors in his book *The Great Gatsby*. He's got these colors, like gold, green, white, gray, and red, and he gives 'em all these deep meanings. Then he uses 'em to make ya remember how somethin' makes ya feel.\n\nTake white and gray, for example. He makes 'em mean somethin' like sameness, like everything's the same. White's a bit nicer, fancier, while gray's more old and faded, ya know?\n\nHe shows ya this right from the start, with everyone wearin' white. Daisy and Jordan, they're always in white. Heck, even Nick's wearin' white to Gatsby's party! And Tom's got on a white shirt when he meets Myrtle.  The only time folks ain't wearin' white is when Nick's at Gatsby's party, and then it's all these loud, bright colors.\n\nFitzgerald uses these colors everywhere, like when Nick goes to work, he goes down these \"white chasms\" in New York.  And the names at Gatsby's party? They're all just \"gray names.\"  Even Catherine's apartment building looks like a big white cake, all the same.\n\nHe even uses white and gray for regular folks and places. Jordan and Daisy had a \"white girlhood.\" There are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in that depressing valley of ashes.  \n\nFitzgerald keeps us thinkin' about these colors, buildin' up this whole feelin' for 'em. Then, when he wants ya to think somethin' ain't important, or it's just part of the crowd, he uses white or gray.\n\nTake Daisy, for example. After he's been using these colors everywhere, he describes Daisy all in white, in her white car. Suddenly, she doesn't seem so special anymore, just like somethin' Gatsby wants, somethin' uniform, like a pretty package. \n\nHe does this with Daisy a few more times, makin' her seem more like a pretty picture than a real person. She's got a \"gray haze\" around her neck, and she's wearin' white again before that big showdown with Tom and Gatsby.",
            "Well, let me tell ya, San Diego's a pretty darn good place to grow stuff. That sunshine and mild weather? Makes for some mighty fine tomatoes, citrus, and all sorts of veggies. You got your squash, your broccoli, herbs galore, even peaches and lemons. And don't forget the berries and peppers!\n\nSeems like folks around here are real keen on their organic eats too. There's a whole heap of folks signed up for community-supported agriculture, waiting for their share of that fresh-picked goodness. And eggs and milk? Organic all the way, folks!\n\nA lot of these farms, they ain't just about the crops. They let you take a gander at how they do things, even go for a hike or watch the birds. Seems like a good way to make a livin' while helpin' out the environment, ya know?\n\nNow, organic farming ain't always easy. It takes a lot more elbow grease to keep those pests and weeds at bay without all the fancy chemicals. Plus, crops sometimes don't do as well as with the regular stuff. But, it sure does do wonders for the critters and plants around here. More biodiversity, that's what they call it.\n\nBut hold on, there's more to it!  These folks makin' a go of it with wildlife in mind, they gotta do all sorts of extra work. Plantin' special cover crops, makin' sure the animals have a good place to graze, even gettin' rid of those pesky invasives.  \n\nSo, this landowner I was talkin' about, he's got a real pickle on his hands. He wants to make a decent livin' and help the critters out too. That takes some know-how and a little help, ya see.\n\nThis land he's lookin' at, it's out near Potrero, a real beautiful spot.  It's got chaparral, grassland, and oak trees, all right next to that Cleveland National Forest.  They're sayin' there's all sorts of critters livin' there, some endangered, some just hangin' on.\n\nBeen sayin' this land's been around for ages, first the Native Americans, then some ranchers and folks sellin' firewood. Back in the day, this was a homestead, so it was probably used for grazin' or choppin' wood.\n\nNow, I found this piece of property online and figured out what kind of help this farmer might be able to get. I even found a real organic farm nearby, doin' pretty much what I'm talkin' about.",
            "Listen, everybody knows culture matters when you're tryin' to get somethin' done.  It ain't just about what a culture is, but what it ain't, you know?  It's not like everyone in a place is the same, like sayin' all Rednecks are stubborn or all them fancy Japanese are always playin' it nice.  That's just plain dumb talk.  \n\nWhat you gotta do is figure out how that culture's gonna play out in the deal you're makin'.  You see the world through your own eyes, and it's natural to compare, but you gotta go deeper than that.\n\nThink about it like this:  when you're dealin' with folks from a different place, you gotta learn their history, their hang-ups, the things they think are important.  Don't go tryin' to change 'em, just gotta respect it.  It's like when you're on someone else's turf - you gotta play by their rules, especially if you're the one with less to offer.  Treat 'em right, show 'em respect for their ways, and you'll get further.\n\nAnd it ain't just countries, you know.  Inside any big company, there's a whole culture goin' on.  Some places are all about workin' 'til you drop, others are laid back.  How they dress, how they talk, who they hire - it all tells ya somethin' about their culture.  Some companies encourage helpin' others, others are all about makin' money.  Just look around you - there's all kinds of different ways to do business.\n\nValues are the real key though.  They're the heart of a culture, the reason everything else is the way it is.  If a culture cares about lookin' good or gettin' along, they ain't gonna embarrass their boss to win a deal.  If they're all about makin' a tough bargain, they ain't gonna cave easy.  \n\nSo, before you walk into any kinda negotiation, do your homework.  Figure out the culture, what they stand for, what makes 'em tick.  And don't forget, get to know the folks you're dealin' with on a personal level too.  That's how you really make a deal.",
            "Dang ol' psalm talkin' about how folks say there ain't no God, right?  Well, that's what Anselm and Aquinas are tryin' to prove wrong.  They both believe in the same God, the one from the Bible.  Now, we gotta figure out whose argument makes more sense, so we're gonna pretend they're both right about God existin'. \n\nAnselm, he thinks we gotta look inside ourselves to find God.  He says since we can think about God, He must be real.  Kinda like, if you can picture a dang ol' redneck in a pickup truck, that means there's gotta be rednecks in pickup trucks out there, right?  Anselm's sayin' that God's gotta be real 'cause we can think about Him.  He calls it faith, I reckon.\n\nAquinas, he's a different kinda fella.  He thinks we can prove God exists with logic and stuff, like lookin' at the world and sayin', \"Hey, this ain't just happenin' by itself, there's gotta be a reason!\"  He's got five different reasons, but they all boil down to sayin' that God makes sense, ya know?\n\nBoth of 'em got some good points, but neither one of 'em really convinces me that God's gotta be real.",
            "Alright, so there was this dude, right? Way back in the day, like 5 or 600 BC, he was born a prince. But this dude, the one they'd later call Buddha, he decided to ditch the fancy life and go all spiritual. He figured out some stuff about how the world works, and his ideas started this whole religion called Buddhism. Now, the most straight-up kind of Buddhism is called Theravada, and it's been around for about 2,500 years. Things have changed a bit since Buddha was around, you know?\n\nLike, in Sri Lanka, these guys still do this big water-cutting ceremony every year. Monks and regular folks, they all join in, and it's kinda important to them, even though Buddha never mentioned anything about it. It's like that with a lot of stuff in Theravada Buddhism—some stuff's changed from the old days, both the little stuff and the big stuff.  The monks and the regular folks who follow Buddhism, they've had to tweak their ideas a bit over time. It's like, life changes things, ya know?\n\nWe gotta talk about some words a lot in this here story. We're gonna say things like \"internal\" and \"external,\" and \"hostile\" and \"benign.\" Think of it this way: \"internal\" means something coming from inside the Buddhist group, whether you're a monk or not. \"External\" means something coming from folks outside of Buddhism. \"Hostile\" means something bad for Buddhism, like someone trying to mess it up. \"Benign\" means something that's not trying to help or hurt Buddhism, but might end up doing one or the other by accident.\n\nFirst things first, let's get the basics of Theravada Buddhism down. Buddhists put their faith in the \"Triple Gem\"—the Buddha, his teachings (the Dhamma), and the community of Buddhists (the Sangha). The Dhamma is like a big library of Buddhist writings called the \"Tripitaka.\"  There's the Sutta Pitaka with all the Buddha's teachings, the Vinaya Pitaka with the rules for monks, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka with the deep, philosophical stuff about Buddhism.\n\nThey talk about things like Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (suffering), and Anicca (everything changes).  They think that by understanding these things, you can escape Sansara, which is like a big wheel of life, death, and being reborn over and over.  And when you get out of that wheel, you get rid of Lobha (desire), Dosa (hatred), and Moha (delusion). That's when you become enlightened.",
            "Listen, you ever hear about how the US and Mexico used to be like cat and dog, fightin' over everything?  They were at odds for like 57 years straight!  Back in the 1840s, we even went to war with 'em over Texas and parts of the Southwest.  It was a real mess, folks.  They call it the Mexican-American War, and we kicked their butts good.  But it weren't just that one fight, see?  They kept buttin' heads over things like religion, their way of life, and all sorts of stuff.  Kinda like how neighbors might argue over a fence or somethin'. \n\nThis ain't nothin' new, though.  Countries that live next to each other, they tend to get into it sometimes.  Look at us and Cuba, or even with Canada sometimes.  It's just how things go.  You got some folks sayin' that we've had more trouble with Mexico and Cuba than any other country.  Maybe they got a point.\n\nNow, religion played a big part in all this.  Back then, Americans didn't like Catholics much, and Mexicans, well, they were Catholic as can be.  Just like the Cold War, where we were against Russia 'cause of their communism, it was kinda like that, but with religion instead.  It ain't easy when you got different beliefs, you know?\n\nThese two countries, they had a lot of spats back then.  Mostly about land, and bandits crossin' the border and causin' trouble.  It took both sides sendin' in the troops to finally put a stop to it.  Eventually, though, things cooled down.  Mexico started dependin' on us more and more, and we weren't so interested in takin' their land anymore.",
            "Fifteen years ago, bam! I got hit with this sickness, outta nowhere.  Didn't even know it existed!  I was a nurse back then, ya know, figured I'd always have a job, 'cause people always get sick.  That's what everyone kept sayin' growing up.  Truth is, I always wanted to be a scientist or a writer, maybe both, but  nursing seemed like the safe bet.  Well, here I am, 46, single, broke as a joke, and can't work.  Still can't, after 15 years on disability.  Got nothin' left,  barely gettin' by.  Every day is a fight,  feelin' like I'm losin' everything I got.  Nothing's certain anymore, except I couldn't have made it this long without my family and a few good friends.  'Cause when life throws you a real curveball,  strong don't mean a darn thing.\n\nMy point is,  life throws ya curveballs, big and small.  No use tryin' to predict 'em,  and sometimes,  no matter how prepared you are,  you just need a hand.  \n\nNow, I get it, we gotta stop relyin' so much on the government.  It's a mess, that much is clear. But wouldn't it be better if folks started lookin' out for each other again?  Help when they can, ask for help when they need it.  Rather than everyone buildin' their own little bunkers.\n\nThose folks talkin' 'bout rugged individualism,  they forget what really built this country.  It wasn't just grit, it was folks lookin' out for each other, sharin' what they had.  Those pioneers crossing the Rockies,  they didn't make it alone.\n\nSo yeah, be prepared!  I am.  Got my disaster kit, first aid, water filters,  even plastic sheeting for the windows,  just in case. Flashlights, batteries, candles, the whole shebang.

            "Alright, so you wanna know how critters change over time, right? Like, why they get all different lookin'?  Well, it ain't simple, ya know?  It's kinda like tryin' to figure out how to build a house just by lookin' at a picture of it. We've got some smart folks tryin' to figure this out with math, like tryin' to write down the rules of how a shell grows up, ya know? They're lookin' at these ancient seashells called Prunum and tryin' to see how they changed over time.\n\nThey're usin' fancy pictures and computer programs to make models of these shells, kinda like buildin' a 3D puzzle. They wanna see what shapes are possible, like what kinda twists and turns a shell can take. Then they're gonna compare that to real shells and see how close they get.\n\nThink of a shell like a spiral staircase windin' around. Each step is a whorl, and the center pole is the columella. Some shells get bigger faster than others, and the line between each whorl is called a suture. The biggest whorl is the one at the bottom, and all the rest are called the spire.  \n\nAnyways, they're tryin' to figure out the rules of the game, how these shells change shape over time.

Like, really fallin' behind.\n\nNow, they're braggin' about makin' sure more babies are born with a doctor or somethin' around,  but let me tell ya, sometimes those \"doctors\" are just old ladies who don't know nothin' 'bout real medicine.  And that's why so many moms end up dyin' from bleedin' out after childbirth.  It's a mess, plain and simple.\n\nOn top of that, fewer kids are gettin' help for their belly aches, and nobody seems to be lookin' after 'em after they're born.

Should they just keep throwin' money at this problem with a bunch of different programs, or should they fix the whole darn healthcare system?  It's a tough call.  Programmatic approaches are easier to manage, but they can suck up all the resources and leave other parts of the system starved.

            "Victorian novels are known for their super detailed descriptions and their focus on the rich and fancy folks back then. But there are a couple of books from that time, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, that don't quite fit that mold. They're kinda spooky and a little weird, which is different from most novels from that era. This weirdness actually makes the characters more interesting, giving us a better understanding of what makes them tick.\n\nTake this passage from Oliver Twist:\n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\nThese books often use mystery and dream-like scenes to do this, but they do it in different ways. In Oliver Twist, these strange happenings show us what's going on inside Oliver's head, his pain, and how he sees the world around him. When Oliver gets shot, he relives it all over again in a dream-like state as he tries to find help. \n\nThis passage shows how out of control Oliver feels.  He's overwhelmed, and his pain is constant and linked with fear, not just shock.  It makes you wonder who's really in charge of his fate, because it's definitely not him.  He doesn't even try to fight back, even when his life is on the line.  This makes you think that maybe he's starting to give up hope, like Fagin has broken him and made him accept this miserable fate.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.\"",
            "A couple years back, I was workin' in this after-school program, helpin' out little kids with their schoolwork. I was pretty good at English and readin', so I'd help out with whatever those kids were strugglin' with. One time, they asked me to help this little fella named Adrian, maybe in third or fourth grade. He was havin' a real tough time readin'. I mean, it was just plain weird. Some letters he'd get right, but others, he'd butcher 'em somethin' fierce.\n\nYou see, Adrian was Latino, spoke perfect English, but his readin' was all messed up. We were hittin' a wall, I mean, I didn't know what to do! Then one day, Adrian's momma came to pick him up. Now, she didn't speak a lick of English. Just Spanish. I could barely spit out a few words myself, but we managed to get by. And that's when it hit me like a ton of bricks: Adrian could read just fine, he just didn't know the English alphabet that well. \n\nI ain't sure if that helped him much, but I sure do hope he's doin' better now. \n\nI tell that story 'cause it shows ya, there's this big ol' language barrier in schools, especially here in California. It ain't always as obvious as ya think. Even if a kid speaks English good, readin' it can be a real headache.\n\nWe all know this problem exists, so what can we do about it? In Adrian's case, it was easy: tutor him in English readin', teach him the alphabet and how to pronounce things right. But for kids who barely speak English, it's a whole different ball game. There ain't just one answer, ya know? Dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes, nothin' works all on its own. We gotta throw everything at it!\n\nDual language programs are a good start. Not just for Spanish speakers, but for everyone.  It's like, kids in these programs do better in school than the rest. Some folks are scared of it, think it wastes money and ain't good for everyone. That's hogwash! If we made these programs the norm, not the exception, everyone would benefit. \n\nBut how do we do it? Make every teacher bilingual? Nah, that's crazy talk. But we could have bilingual assistants, tutors, whatever ya wanna call 'em, to help out.",
            "Man, ever since we were little kids, folks told us there's somethin' bigger out there, somethin' we can't even wrap our heads around. Some go to church, some go to temple, some just try to figure it out on their own. A lot of us just go with what our folks taught us, but some folks, they say \"heck no!\", they don't believe in nothin' but what they can see right in front of 'em.  We might believe in one thing one day, then change our minds the next.  No matter what, we're all lookin' for somethin' to give our lives meaning, somethin' to light the way when things get dark.\n\nMy dad, he loved cardinals. I asked him once, sittin' on the porch, rain comin' down like crazy. We were smokin' cigarettes, my dad lookin' thin and tired, his hair gettin' sparser by the day. He just stared out at the rain, thinkin' about somethin', I guess.  I felt kinda lost, scared, and couldn't bring myself to say nothin' 'bout how much I was gonna miss him, 'cause talkin' about it would just make it all too real. So I hugged him, sat closer, and just watched the rain with him.\n\n\nMy dad passed away that December, just a few days after I turned 22.  They tried to help him with chemo and radiation, but it just kept him alive longer, even though he was sufferin'. I couldn't figure out what good that was doin'. What kind of God would let somethin' like that happen, I thought.  I didn't pray, 'cause I figured God had stopped listenin' to me a long time ago.\n\nI didn't wanna watch him die. I couldn't. I wanted to remember him how he was, not how he died. Besides, I knew him better than anyone else, better than his family even. I knew he wouldn't want me standin' there watchin' him go.  So I just curled up in bed for three days, waitin' for the news. \n\nNo one even called me.",
            "So, this whole \"Gothic Novel\" thing, it's kinda like a head-scratcher.  You got this fancy name, \"Gothic,\" but it's like sayin' somethin' that's both old and new at the same time.  This fella, Ian Watt, he says it best in his book about how Gothic novels came to be.  Folks have been talkin' smack about 'em, praisin' 'em to the heavens, sayin' they ain't got nothin' goin' on, then turnin' around and sayin' they're pure genius.  It's a real mixed bag, this Gothic stuff. \n\nIt all started with this guy, Horace Walpole, and his book, \"The Castle of Otranto.\"  He mixed up these old-timey stories with the newfangled novels folks were writin' back then.  He called it \"A Gothic Story,\" and it was somethin' new, somethin' different.  Gothic novels, they got all this stuff from those old medieval plays and castles, and all those fancy traditions.  Back when Walpole wrote his book, people were already throwin' around the word \"Gothic\" for all sorts of things, but it usually meant somethin' old-fashioned or kinda dumb compared to all the newfangled stuff everyone thought was so much better.  But by puttin' these old Gothic ideas into a new kind of story, somethin' where you got right inside the characters' heads, somethin' new and powerful happened.  Gothic stuck around for a long time, even though it felt both old and brand new at the same time.\n\nOne big thing about Gothic is this idea of chivalry.  You know, knights and all that.  In those old days, they trained these knights to be brave, honorable, all that jazz.  Gothic writers, well, they liked that idea a lot, 'cause they felt like folks weren't so chivalrous anymore.  So they used those old knightly ideas to make the past seem better than the present.  It's like sayin', \"Hey, back in the day, folks were awesome, but now everyone's messed up!\"\n\nWalpole, he wrote \"The Castle of Otranto\" when things were kinda crazy politically.  He was worried about the future, and maybe felt like folks had lost their way.  In his book, he shows this character, Frederic, who's supposed to be this perfect knight.  He's got all the fancy words and descriptions, like he's straight outta a medieval fairytale.  Walpole's tryin' to make you think, \"Wow, back in the day, these guys were somethin' special!\"",

Managers gotta use all these parts to make the customers happy.\n\nFirst up is makin' the stuff, that's the heart of the whole thing.  Gotta figure out what to make, how much, where, and how to do it.  Look at what folks are buyin', that's your clue what they want.  Lots of talk about the market, fancy word for what people are buyin'.  Once you know what to make, gotta decide where to make it, gotta be the right place for makin' that kinda stuff good and right.  Then it's schedulin' who does what, and keepin' the machines workin'.  Don't mess this part up, it'll cost ya in the long run!\n\nUsed to work at Walmart and Target, both got all sorts of rules and booklets for everything, from how an employee's uniform should look to how to unload trucks.  Gotta have it all figured out so everyone knows what they're doin'.\n\nThen comes gettin' the stuff, see, gotta figure out where to get all the parts and stuff to make the product.  You might have different places makin' different parts, gotta figure out who's best for what.  Sometimes you gotta hire other companies to help, that's callin' it \"outsourcing\".  Doin' this makes things faster and cheaper, but do it right, or you'll end up payin' more.",

They got this bunch of tough guys runnin' things, callin' themselves the junta, and they ain't afraid to use force if folks start gettin' uppity.  \n\nA few years back, these monks, they started protestin', wearin' their saffron robes, lookin' all peaceful and stuff. But the junta, they didn't like it. They started crackin' down hard, beatin' folks up, even killin' some. It was a real mess. They even locked up some fellas just for tryin' to take pictures of what was goin' on. \n\nNow, this ain't the first time somethin' like this has happened.  Governments, they always want to be in charge, ain't they?   Like those Roman emperors, thinkin' they were gods.  And don't even get me started on those Japanese emperors, thinkin' they're gods too! And let's not forget ol' George W.

And who can forget ol' Hitler, with his whole \"Final Solution\" thing?\n\nIt's enough to make a fella want to move to Mars, ain't it?",
            "Duke Ellington was a jazz legend, and one reason why is he stuck around so long and kept making new music. He really knew how to shape his band, making 'em sound like a real family. \n\nNow, you might not hear Ellington playing the piano a whole lot in some of his songs, but he was a whiz at writing music that was both fancy and deep. He'd give his guys room to show off their skills, letting 'em improvise, but he also knew how to write tight sections where everyone had to play just right.  He was like a conductor, makin' sure every instrument sounded good together,  creating somethin' fresh and new every time. Because of this, he wrote some of the best jazz music ever.\n\nThis one music book says he was always tryin' new things, like using voices as instruments. Check out \"Creole Love Call\", where he uses a voice to add some texture to the music without actually singin' any words.  He was always findin' ways to make his musicians shine, and this song shows it. It's a slow blues song where the voice and the woodwinds take turns talkin' to each other. The trumpet player does some fancy stuff, the clarinet player soars high, and the whole band comes together in the end. It's a real showstopper, and you can hear how much Ellington cared about makin' each part sound perfect.\n\nHe did the same thing in another song called \"Hot and Bothered\". He had a trumpet player named \"Bubber\" and a singer named Baby Cox, and they'd go back and forth, makin' their voices and instruments sound like one. It was like a conversation, kinda funny and kinda soulful. Then there's \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\", where he uses a trombone player named \"Tricky Sam\" to start the song.

This need started when she was about 14, just a young'un, and it was still there three years later, at 17. By then, she figured out she wanted someone, not some material thing.  But she just wasn't interested in any fellas. Some tried to court her, makin' all them awkward moves, but nobody really caught her eye. She wondered about herself a lot, tryin' to figure out why this was happenin' to her.  She thought about it for a few years, tryin' to come up with answers, but nothin' really stuck. So she just kept on livin', always wonderin' about what she really wanted.\n\nHer days at home were usually pretty peaceful.  Her folks were good, quiet folks.  They never fought, and strangely enough, they hardly ever argued with her either. The only time they ever clashed was when she tried to show 'em she was her own person. She was the daughter of two calm souls, but she sure did bring the energy with her big, fun personality. She was a likeable gal, and that personality sure didn't hurt.\n\nBut today wasn't a calm day.  She was wanderin' around the house, lookin' for somethin' to inspire her, when she heard a little scream from the kitchen. It was her mama's voice, and it sounded scared. She ran in, panic settin' in, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\"  \n\nHer mama was on the floor, holdin' herself, lettin' out little \"Ow\"s every time she breathed. Her daughter rushed to her side, puttin' a hand on her. \"Ouch... sweety, I... need you to take me to... the hospital.\" Her words were rushed and strained. Her daughter knew right then, her mama was hurt bad.  \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" \n\nHer mama pointed her hand, and her daughter, grateful she'd taken those strength trainin' classes, scooped her mama up and carried her to the car. She laid her down in the back, and they drove off.\n\nThe hospital smelled like medicine and sickness, kinda scary, but she wasn't feelin' that. She was too busy worryin' about her mama. She rushed her inside and shouted for help.  A few worried faces gathered around, someone grabbed a gurney and laid mama down on it.

They wanted to see if the nurses who ate more like folks in the Mediterranean had fewer heart attacks and strokes.\n\nTurns out, they did!  The nurses who ate the healthiest, they had less heart problems and strokes compared to the others. It's like a magic shield against those nasty heart attacks and strokes.",
            "You know, back in 2007, America took a real nosedive. Jobs went poof, houses weren't worth nothin', and even the big ol' companies were goin' belly up. This mess, it's still hangin' around like a bad smell, so we gotta figure out what went wrong, right? Well, lemme tell ya, it all started with some real dumb decisions made by folks in these fancy suits in Washington. They were pressurin' banks and businesses to hand out loans to folks who couldn't afford 'em, like givin' candy to a bunch of sugar-crazed kids. Meanwhile, these government fellas, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, they were gettin' pressured to bundle up all these bad loans and sell 'em off like hotcakes. When folks started missin' their payments, the whole thing went kablooey. Banks were broke, folks lost their homes, and the whole darn economy went south faster than a greased pig at a county fair.\n\nSee, this whole mess started back in 1999, when Bill Clinton was still in the White House. He was lookin' to get re-elected, so he loosened up the rules on loans, thinkin' he could buy himself another term. Well, bless his heart, he didn't see the trouble comin'.  A fella named Steven Holmes over at the New York Times, he saw right through it. He was sayin' back then that Fannie Mae, the big mortgage bank, was gettin' pushed too hard to make loans to folks who couldn't afford 'em. He even said it might lead to another financial disaster like what happened in the 80s with the savings and loans.  Boy, was he right!\n\nThey started makin' these fancy new mortgages, with adjustable rates and all sorts of bells and whistles.  Folks were buyin' houses faster than you can say \"open house,\" and nobody thought nothin' of it.  But it was all a big ol' bubble, just waitin' to burst. And burst it did! When the housing market crashed, all those fancy mortgages went south, and the whole financial system went with 'em.  Big banks were in trouble, folks were losin' their homes, and the economy was tankin' faster than a greased pig at a county fair.",

Instead of sayin' \"This fella was a real heartbreaker, he had a whole bunch of girlfriends,\" show 'em!  Let 'em see him charm the socks off some dame or make a gal blush with a wink. \n\nSame goes for that gal who lost her man.  Instead of just sayin' she was heartbroken, show her cryin' her eyes out, or maybe picturing him in her mind, or even gettin' back into the swing of things with a new hobby.\n\nIt's all about makin' 'em feel somethin', ya know?

            "Well, lemme tell ya 'bout these newscasts I watched from Columbus, Ohio. I caught the NBC 4 one this mornin', August 13th, 2011.  Their big story was 'bout this fella in Ashley, Ohio, named Shad Hostettler who stabbed his wife - didn't say her name though. They showed his picture, and lemme tell ya, the guy looked like pure evil! They only spent a couple minutes on it, 'cause it was still unfoldin', but they said he stabbed her a whole bunch and got busted. Seems like they covered it just right.\n\nThen they had a story 'bout a young fella, Travis Buyers, 18 years old, shot in the Sharon Woods area.  He was real bad off, no arrests yet, SWAT team lookin' into it. Seemed kinda rushed, and it made me think, ya know, maybe it's 'cause he was a black man or livin' in a black neighborhood. I've noticed for years, the media don't give minorities the same attention when they're hurt. If it's a white kid or grown-up, they go crazy, but a minority, they're lucky to even get a mention.\n\nNext up was a story about a .22 bullet hittin' a Med-Flight chopper. They figured out where it happened and everything. Crime Stoppers was offerin' five grand for any info leadin' to the shooter.\n\nThen they threw in a quick one 'bout rain and thunderstorms comin' on Saturday. They said it'd be in the eighties all weekend.  They kept it short, probably to get ya hooked for more.\n\nThey also had a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road. Said the guy was black, wearin' a hoodie, about six foot tall and one hundred and fifty pounds.  They kept hammerin' on 'bout him bein' black and how dark he was. Seemed kinda strange to me.\n\nFinally, they talked 'bout this Rene Rodriguez, some drug kingpin from Texas.  Convicted of sendin' tons of weed to Ohio.  Instead of sayin' he got twenty-five years, they said \"300 months.\"  Maybe they thought that sounded scarier or somethin'.  They also mentioned he was Hispanic, but that didn't really seem important to the story.",
            "Brothers, man, they're somethin' else.  Ya know, there's this crazy bond between 'em, like nothin' else. It's filled with all kinds of stuff: love, pride, jealousy, even anger sometimes.  Brothers get each other, more than anyone else, like lookin' in a mirror. You see yourself in 'em, the good and the bad. And when things get tough, that bond really shows its true colors, for better or worse.  It's a heavy thing, that bond, and it comes with a price.  \n\nYa gotta understand, when you look at your brother, you see yourself, not how folks see you, but the real you.  What you do, and what happens because of it, that's your true character. This story, \"The Scarlet Ibis\", it's all about that, about these two brothers and all the crazy stuff they feel for each other.\n\nThis story takes place in a beautiful, lush place, but these boys, they're on a trip that ain't gonna end well. There's this big clash between disappointment and pride, and in the end, only one brother makes it out alive. The story shows you the brother's feelings through the main character, Doodle, and how he acts.  It's like lookin' into his head, seein' how he feels about everything, and how that shapes his actions.\n\nThis brother, he's all about pride, from the moment he and Doodle first head out together, right up to that last, bad trip. He wanted a brother he could teach all sorts of things to, like how to hold his breath, run, jump, climb trees, all that.  He wanted someone to race with, someone to hang out with. But Doodle, he was born different, with a weak heart.  It was like his dreams were crushed right there. The poor kid was never gonna be able to do any of that stuff. This brother, he even thought about smotherin' Doodle, can you believe it? That's some dark stuff. But then Doodle smiles at him, and his heart melts.  See, deep down, he loved his brother, even if he didn't always show it.",
            "Now listen up, cuz the brain is a right tricky thing, kinda like tryin' to figure out how a dang tractor works. Back in the day, folks thought it was like a wax tablet, then a scroll, then a book. Nowadays, they say it's like a computer. But just remember, these ol' sayings ain't always right, kinda like sayin' a 2x4 is gonna solve all your problems.\n\nSo here's the deal: you got all these senses, right? They're like little spies, tellin' your brain about the world - touchin' stuff, hearin' noises, seein' colors. Your brain takes all that info and shuffles it around, makin' sense of it all. It's like buildin' a picture outta jigsaw pieces, startin' with the little bits and then puttin' 'em together to see the whole thing. Sometimes it's like, \"Hey, that's a box!\" and other times it's like, \"Hold on, is that a box or a hole?\"  Your brain's always guessin' and chewin' on things.\n\nNow your brain's got this filter, kinda like a bouncer at a club. It decides what's important and what can be tossed aside. You see a whole bunch of blades of grass, but your brain's like, \"Nah, ain't worth payin' attention to those.\" But if someone says your name, bam! Your brain's all ears.\n\nTo remember stuff, your brain's got these storerooms: short-term memory, where things hang out for a bit, and long-term memory, where things stick around for good. It's like puttin' stuff in a filing cabinet, but your brain does it all with electricity and chemicals, which is way more complicated than me tryin' to organize my toolshed.\n\nNow, folks try to figure out how all this knowledge is organized in your brain, kinda like tryin' to map out a big ol' maze. Some say it's like a web, where ideas are connected to each other. And that makes sense, cuz think about it - \"chair\" is connected to \"table,\" \"table\" is connected to \"wood,\" and so on.  It's all tangled up, just like life itself!",
            "Now listen, this Huxley fella, he's got somethin' to say about all this fancy tech and the whole money-grubbin' system we got goin' on.  He wrote this book, \"Brave New World,\" and it's a real downer. These people, they ain't got no individuality. They're all about bein' part of the crowd and gettin' their kicks right now, no matter what. They're just pawns in a game played by this big-shot World Controller. \n\nSee, this book, it makes ya think about all that Marxist stuff, ya know, the class struggle and all that. Huxley was suspicious about all this progress and how it messes with regular folks.  He's talkin' about how the rich folks keep the poor folks dumb and happy,  makin' 'em think they're doin' alright when they ain't.  It's like they're hypnotized into just buyin' and buyin', never questionin' nothin'.\n\nThe World Controller, he's like the big boss man, pullin' all the strings. He makes sure the folks are happy, but only in a shallow way.  They got all this stuff, but no real connection to each other.  It's all about appearances and instant gratification.\n\nAnd the people, they're just puppets. They don't even know they're bein' controlled. They just go along with it, thinkin' they're livin' the good life.  \n\nIt's kinda like what Marx said about the rich guys exploitin' the poor guys.  They keep 'em busy with distractions, makin' 'em think they're better off than they really are.  \n\nHuxley's book is a warning, y'know? He's sayin' that if we keep goin' down this path, we're gonna lose our freedom and our humanity. We gotta wake up and see what's really goin' on before it's too late.",
            "Well, I've been slummin' it here at University Park for about two and a half years now, four and a half semesters if you wanna get technical. Let me tell ya, gettin' around this campus is a real pain in the neck, and I ain't talkin' about the dang squirrels! My freshman year, they stuck me in one of those East Halls dorms,  like way out east, past the football stadium and that big ol' Bryce Jordan Center.  To get to my classes, man, you'd think I was crossin' the Sahara Desert!  Willard building, right smack in the middle of campus, felt like it was a hundred miles away. Walkin' there in the rain, which happens more often than not in State College,  could take you 25 minutes, easy. I talked to this old grad, not much older than me, and he told me those East Halls used to be way out in the boonies, surrounded by nothin' but empty land. Now it's all fancy sports fields, new buildings like that new Creamery and the health center, and apartments everywhere.  Seems like they're buildin' somethin' new every day, but nothin' to help us get around!\n\nNow, what's the answer to this transportation mess?  A bicycle, that's what!  But it ain't just about havin' a bike, ya know?  Students gotta use 'em, and the campus needs to be built with bikes in mind.\n\nI was talkin' to my buddy, he got back into ridin' after takin' a break for a few years. He said, \"Forget about it, bikes are the only way to go!  It ain't cool to ride bikes anymore, but it's the dang fastest way to get around.\" Besides bein' good for ya, it's the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little peddlin' and you can go 30 miles, easy.  I live off campus now, just as far from the center of campus as some dorms, and the best decision I made all year was buyin' a bike.  I take classes in Thomas building, a good 25-minute walk from my house.  On a bike, I can get there in 5 minutes flat if I pedal like a madman.\n\nThe only problem is, Pollock Road, the shortcut to Thomas, ain't always the easiest ride, bike or not.  Walkin' ain't bad, but I'm too busy for that. Without my bike, walkin' is my only option, and that's a whole lotta time wasted."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Well lemme tell ya, I'm thinkin' about gettin' into this social work thing. I wanna help out kids who've been treated bad or ain't got nothin' goin' for 'em, and try to mend those messed up families.\n\nNow, I ain't just talkin' about doin' the job, I'm talkin' 'bout livin' it.  I believe in treatin' folks right, doin' the honest thing, and always tryin' to make things better, both for folks and for myself.  I wanna learn all I can so I can be the best darn social worker I can be.\n\n Truth is, I've always felt kinda pulled towards helpin' folks. High school and college, I saw a lot of folks runnin' from their problems, tryin' to deal with 'em in ways that ain't right.  I even got my degree in Psychology, thinkin' that'd lead me somewhere. But I wasn't sure what path to take.  \n\nThen one time, my friend introduced me to this young fella, just sixteen, lookin' all scared and nervous. Turns out, he was runnin' from his folks 'cause they were treatin' him awful. I told the police what I knew, and they asked me to talk to his parents.  Well, let me tell ya, they weren't too happy about it. They tried to make excuses, sayin' he was just bein' manipulative.  That's when I knew, this is what I gotta do. Help these kids, help these families, even when folks don't wanna see it.\n\nAnd it ain't just about the kids, it's about doin' what's right.  Society talks a big game about lookin' out for each other, but sometimes it feels like we're more worried about fittin' in than standin' up for what's right.  I ain't afraid to be different, to speak my mind, to stand up for those who can't stand up for themselves.  That's what social justice is all about,  and that's what I'm gonna fight for.",
            "Now, lemme tell ya 'bout this here sleep stuff. There's two main ways to look at why folks can't get a good night's rest: the science stuff and the folksy stuff. \n\nThe science folks, they say it's all in your genes, passed down from your momma and daddy. They look at your body, see if there's anything screwy with your insides, makin' it hard to sleep. \n\nThe other folks, they say it's all about where you come from, who you hang with, and what kinda life you lead. They say things like your race, how much money you got, and even what kinda neighborhood you live in can mess with your sleep. \n\nThis here paper, it takes a look at both these ways of thinkin' about sleep problems. It talks 'bout all sorts of studies, seein' if they back up these ideas. And it ain't afraid to call 'em out if they're full of baloney, too!\n\nNow, sleep problems come in all shapes and sizes. Some folks just can't fall asleep, some folks can't stay asleep, and some folks have weird dreams or act all goofy in their sleep.  Some folks get these sleep problems 'cause of other stuff goin' on in their heads, like worry or sadness. \n\nThis paper, though, mostly focuses on sleep problems called insomnia, where folks just can't seem to get a good night's rest. It looks at how both the science folks and the folksy folks explain this problem.\n\nOne study, for example, looked at mice and their little sleep brains. They found that some tiny parts in the mice's brains that control sleepin' and wakin' had something called GABAB receptors.  Turns out, if these receptors are messed up, it can make the mice sleepy all the time! The scientists think this might be true for humans, too.  So, maybe some folks have sleepy genes!  \n\nThis study shows us that sleep problems can be caused by both our genes and our environment. What we eat, how much we exercise, and even the stress we feel can all affect how well we sleep.",
            "Alright, so listen up!  This here's about this thing called CAPD, which is like when your brain has trouble makin' sense of what you hear.  It ain't that you can't hear nothin', it's just that your brain's gettin' all mixed up tryin' to figure out what folks are sayin'. Kinda like tryin' to understand someone talkin' real fast, or when there's a bunch of noise goin' on around 'em.\n\nNow, how do ya know if someone's got this CAPD thing? Well, there's a few telltale signs, kinda like red flags.  They might have trouble followin' conversations, especially if there's a lot goin' on. Or maybe they struggle to tell where a sound is comin' from. Sometimes they can't tell the difference between two sounds that are real close together, like tryin' to pick out one voice in a crowd.\n\nSo, what can ya do if you're a teacher and one of your students has CAPD?  Well, ya gotta be patient, see? And maybe try speakin' a little slower and clearer.  And make sure they're sittin' in a spot where they can hear ya good, away from all the distractions.  Maybe even use some visual aids, like pictures or gestures, to help 'em understand.",
            "Now listen, this play, Twelfth Night, it's kinda sayin' that while wearin' a mask, pretendin' to be someone you ain't, can work for a while,  it can mess you up real bad if ya keep it up. You start to lose yourself in all that pretendin', and that ain't good.  The problem is, when you gotta drop the act, folks might get mad. You might even lose the friendships you made while wearin' the mask. It's like, do you stay true to yourself, or keep up the charade to keep everyone happy?  Some folks might not care if you've been pullin' the wool over their eyes, but others, well, they might take it real hard.\n\nThis whole pretendin' thing gets really tricky when it comes to gender, see? It makes ya wonder, why'd you start wearin' the mask in the first place? Like, what's drivin' ya to be someone you ain't? In this play, Viola, she's gotta pretend to be a man to stay safe. She's in a new place, all alone, and it's a rough world out there for a woman. So she puts on the disguise, and it works, but it also cuts her off from the other women. She's all alone, even though she's surrounded by folks.  \n\nThen there's this whole mess with Olivia, who falls head over heels for \"Cesario\", thinking he's a man.  And to top it off, Viola's got feelings for Orsino, but she can't act on 'em because she's playin' the part of a man.  It's a whole tangled web, ain't it?\n\nMaybe the whole thing is supposed to show us that pretendin' can bring out feelings we don't even know we got, like with Olivia and Orsino. Maybe they're  strugglin' with stuff they ain't even aware of, and Viola just makes 'em face it head-on.  Or maybe Olivia's just a bit shallow, fallin' for whoever looks good, regardless of who they really are. She kinda ditches Cesario the second Sebastian shows up, and then suddenly Cesario's just family.  Kind of makes ya think about who we really love and why.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya, them Germans, they weren't all sunshine and rainbows when it came to runnin' their colonies. They got a real nasty reputation, especially for what they did to the Ovaherero and Nama folks in South West Africa, back when it was called that. But you can't just paint the whole darn empire with one brush, you know? Just like a pack of hounds, they acted different in different parts of the world. Same goes for their schools. Sometimes they built their own schools and taught the natives, other times they just let the fellas in funny hats do it.\n\nNow, in East Africa, where the Brits took over later, they found a bunch of folks who could read and write. The Germans had done some good there, some folks even said so back then. But down in South West Africa, it was a whole different story. They didn't care much for teachin' the locals. They mostly left that to the missionaries, who weren't exactly rolling in dough. \n\nThey were real keen on teachin' the white folks though, buildin' fancy schools and makin' sure the missionaries were doin' it right.  This messed things up real bad for South West Africa, even after the Germans were gone.  While other places had lots of smart folks, South West Africa was stuck in the dark ages. Nobody knew nothin' but their own language and traditions. \n\nWhy was it so different? That's what this paper's gonna try to figure out. We're gonna look at the folks who lived there, the folks who ran the show, and see what made them tick.  There's been a lotta books written about this, mostly in German, back when the Germans were still runnin' things. They mostly just described how the schools worked. But later, some folks wrote in English, comparing all the different parts of the German empire and lookin' closer at what made each place tick.",
            "Ya know, music these days, it's gotten crazy! There's so many different kinds of it, like rock, country, jazz, rap, even folk. And each one of them has got its own little offshoots, like branches on a tree. But heavy metal, that's something else. It's like the whole forest exploded, with all these different kinds of trees growing everywhere.\n\nIt all started about forty years ago, and people started realizing they could make this music really loud and intense, kinda like a dark storm cloud. They weren't afraid to sing about the tough stuff, the things that make you think, the bad times, ya know? And the music, man, it's got this power to it, all those guitars and drums, it just grabs you.\n\nNow, there are so many different kinds of heavy metal, it's hard to say what it really is anymore. It's like a melting pot, with bits and pieces of all these other genres mixed in. But you gotta remember, it all started somewhere.\n\nHeavy metal is more than just music, it's a whole attitude. It's about pushing the limits, being loud and proud, and not being afraid to be different. It's about the darkness, the raw emotion, the things that most people try to hide. Back in the seventies, there were all these drugs around, and they made people wanna express themselves in new and crazy ways. That's where a lot of the heavy metal sound came from. \n\nAnd you know what?  It's still going strong today. People still love that dark energy, that feeling of being alive.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya, this here Henri Rousseau fella, he was a dreamer, just like those fancy Surrealists, but he was doin' it way back before they came along. See, he painted this picture called \"The Dream\" back in 1910. Now, it ain't just some lady lookin' at pretty stuff in her dream, it's Rousseau himself dreamin' big dreams about bein' a famous painter. He wanted folks to like his work, ya know, to be recognized and all that jazz. But here's the thing, he was stuck in this pickle. He wanted to be accepted by the art snobs, but he also wanted to paint his own way, not just copy what everyone else was doin'.  It was a real head-scratcher for him.\n\nNow, lemme tell ya a little about this Rousseau guy. He wasn't born with a silver spoon in his mouth, not like those fancy art kids. He was a simple man, worked for the government collectin' tolls, nothin' fancy. He lost his wife and kids, so he turned to paintin' to make himself feel better. But he really wanted to be taken seriously as an artist.\n\nProblem was, he was up against some real tough competition. These other artists, they were already famous and makin' a name for themselves.  He was like a late bloomer, tryin' to catch up.  Some folks say he just wanted to paint somethin' so plain and simple that those fancy art folks would finally say, \"Hey, that ain't bad!\" But wouldn't ya know it, that's what made him different.",
            "Lotsa smart folks have said that good stuff and pretty stuff go together, same as truth and beauty. I reckon there's a reason for that. Like that fella Keats, he said, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty— That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" We learn a lot in life from books and doin' things, but we just seem to know when somethin' is right or pretty, without havin' to be taught. Both good stuff and pretty stuff are about describin' things, not tellin' ya how to do it. When we talk about what makes somethin' good art or right, we're mostly just tryin' to figure out why it is that way, not makin' rules for makin' it.\n\nHere's the thing, though: ya can't ever really put yer finger on what makes somethin' good or pretty.  Talkin' 'bout da Vinci's Mona Lisa, ya might say things like the way the front and back are done, or the colors, or even what kinda time it was made in. But that don't really tell ya why it's so darn good. When folks talk 'bout their favorite art or story, they'll often say somethin' like, \"There's just somethin' about it,\" before they can even begin to explain it. \n\nI reckon art and good stuff can't be fully explained, just like Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how much ya describe somethin', there's always somethin' more, somethin' special that ya just can't put into words. I think that's what makes art and good stuff so powerful.  It's that somethin' special, that je ne sais quoi, that connects 'em.\n\nI think art and good stuff are so close because we feel 'em deep down, in a way that's hard to explain.  Like when ya read a good book, it gets ya right in the gut. Literature especially, because it's all about values, just like life.  We love literature because it shows us what matters.",
            "Germany today is a real powerhouse, a united country with its own unique culture. You can feel it everywhere, from the fancy city of München in the mountains to the coastal town of Kiel by the Baltic Sea. It's the same in Köln on the Rhine River, all the way through to Dresden, a cool old city on the Elbe River. With a culture this unique, it shouldn't surprise anyone that modern Germany is made up of lots of different groups and tribes.\n\nNow, Germania is where the Germans came from way back in the day.  Folks can't agree on how the name came about, even the smart historians!  One guy named Tacitus said it came from a German tribe called the Tungrians, who were called Germans before they crossed the Rhine and fought with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98).  Julius Caesar, famous for his wars with the Gauls, was the first to use the word \"Germanus\" in his writings. He used it to separate the Gauls he conquered from the Germans who kept crossing the Rhine and causing trouble (Caesar, 50-40 BC). Some think Caesar got the word from the Gauls themselves, who used it to talk about their neighbors.  In his first book about the Gallic Wars, Caesar says, \"Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others say \"German\" comes from their fighting spears, called \"ger\" (O.E.D, 2010), or maybe from an old Irish word meaning \"to shout,\" which means the Germans were loud and noisy (Names of Germany).\n\nA Roman writer named Tacitus, back in 98 AD, wrote a book called \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" about where the Germans came from. He thought they were completely original, not mixed with other people from other places. He said, “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?” (Tacitus, 98)\n\nAnd who'd want to leave Rome for Germania?  Not the Romans, not at first anyway! They went into Germania to get things they wanted and fought battles sometimes, but mostly they went home to their big empire. So, while the Germanic tribes were around in the first century, they lived on the edge of the Roman Empire. They traded the stuff they got from the land and even fought in the Roman army (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "I looked down, my mind kinda blank, just taking in what was in front of me.  I wasn't feelin' nothin' much, just kinda watchin' it all go down. My brain was workin', but it wasn't makin' no real sense of it, just like, seein' stuff and lettin' it go.  Thoughts were poppin' in and out like fireflies, real quick and easy. It was like my mind was a river, just flowin' on by.  \n\nRemember that art book I got, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\"?  Ever since I was a kid, I wanted to learn how to draw, and this book was supposed to teach ya everything, right down to how your brain sees lines. One trick they show you is to put a square around somethin' you wanna draw, like a bowl of fruit on a table, and that turns it into just the bowl of fruit, simple like that.\n\nBut lookin' at this thing, I couldn't do that. It was too much, you know? Picasso had his blue period, Monet loved all them greens, and the old Italian guys, they used every color under the sun.  If I was gonna call myself an artist, then this was my start, my story, my \"Work in Brown\".  \n\nSo, I grabbed my tool, my hand moved, my mind tryin' to make somethin' outta nothin'. The water was calm, clean, and clear.  Stuff was breakin' off and floatin' away.  Then my hand got all tight, like I was nervous, and I slammed the handle of the toilet.  That brown thing wouldn't budge, stuck like glue.\n\nMop in my hand, standin' there with my tie chokin' me, I just stared at this thing someone left behind.  A few more flushes, a few more moments of thinkin' about nothin', then I grabbed the toilet paper and wrapped myself up like a glove.  Standin' up, then bendin' over, I reached into the bowl, like a mama checkin' on her turkey in the oven...",
            "Teenagers, dang, they're killin' themselves out there on the road! It's a real mess, y'all.  The brainiacs at the National Institutes of Health say our young'uns ain't quite got the noggin' for drivin' yet.  It's like givin' a 2x4 to a chihuahua - ain't gonna end well! They're just inexperienced, plain and simple. That means more wrecks, more roll-overs, more speedin', more cars endin' up in ditches than ya can shake a stick at.  \n\nAnd don't even get me started on havin' their buddies in the car!  Somebody smarter than me down in California did a study and figured out that the more little buckaroos in the car, the more likely somethin's gonna go sideways. \n\nNow, they're tryin' to fix it with these fancy \"provisional\" licenses, limitin' the hours they can drive and who they can haul around.  But that ain't gonna cut it!  The problem is, they're just not ready.  \n\nThis fella Zuckerman, a real smart cookie, says even 18 is too young! Says kids under 20 just gotta have that need for speed, like they're lookin' for trouble. \n\nSo, we gotta wait 'til they grow up a bit, ya know?  My momma always said, \"Patience is a virtue,\" and she was right!  Otherwise, we're gonna have more wrecks than a demolition derby, especially with all those baby boomers' kids gettin' their licenses soon. \n\nWe gotta do somethin', y'all.  Schools can teach 'em about drivin', but nobody under 18 should be behind the wheel.  Maybe a permit first, then some extra practice time with a responsible adult.  Just like the other states, we gotta make it a national thing, ya know?  Keepin' those young'uns safe is what matters most!",
            "So I was looking through these old movies from way back when Edison was makin' 'em.  Found fifteen of these \"trick\" movies from 1895 to 1901. These things are all about makin' stuff look like magic, ya know? I basically tried to figure out how they made 'em work and see if any of the later ones were doin' somethin' different. Most of these old movies, they're stuck in one spot, just like a stage play. No fancy mov'in' around the camera, just straight-on shots, nothin' fancy like you see now.  But some of 'em, they started to break the rules a little bit, doin' things like havin' more than one shot, which was pretty daring back then.\n\nOne thing all these trick movies got in common is they're filmed like a stage play. Picture a curtain, that's what these movies are like. The camera sits right there, like it's in the front row of the audience, and it don't move.  That's how they did it back then, just like those vaudeville shows, you know? The actors can only walk back and forth, never comin' right at ya or walkin' away. Like in this one movie, \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel,\" the fellas come in from one side and just move back and forth. The camera don't follow 'em anywhere.\n\nBecause they're stuck in this one spot, the shots are all long and sometimes medium.  They never get up close to anyone's face, not even once.  That's how they did it in those old theaters, too, you had to see the whole scene at once.\n\nAnd most of these trick movies, they're just one big shot, start to finish. Like one idea, one whole movie. That's why they're so short, maybe a minute or less. They're more like those little tricks you see in vaudeville, magic and stuff.\n\nBut here's the thing, what they call one shot ain't always one real shot. Sometimes they put a bunch of 'em together to make it look like somethin' is disappearin' or comin' back.  Take \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots,\" that one's from way back.  If you look real close, you can see where they cut together a bunch of shots to make it look like her head is comin' off.",
            "Listen up, folks! This John Taylor fella, he was a real firebrand back in the day, a true-blue Republican. Now, he was a farmer, through and through, but that didn't stop him from talkin' his mind on politics. He was all about freedom, you know, for himself and everyone else. And let me tell ya, he believed that a farmer's way of life was the best way to live. That's what shaped his whole outlook on government, from how it should be run to what it should be allowed to do.\n\nHe thought America had a real chance to get things right, see? No old traditions to hold us back, so we could build our own government, one where folks could rule themselves. He was a big believer in folks' natural rights, that everyone's equally important and deserve to be treated right. He thought those rights should be protected from the government, because if one guy gets trampled, it messes up everything for everyone.\n\nTaylor, he was a firm believer in good and evil, black and white. He said, \"Government's run by people, so it's gonna have all the good and bad that comes with people.\"  He wanted a government that protected your stuff, helped farmers out, and kept big businesses in check. He figured a good government, even if run by selfish folks, would still do right by everyone. He just wanted those in charge to remember that their job was to help the common man, not line their own pockets.\n\nNow, Taylor, he was a stickler for the Constitution. He wanted the government to stick to what it said in there, plain and simple. He knew a big government would be expensive and likely get out of control. But he also knew just reading the words wasn't enough. You gotta understand what the guys who wrote it meant! And he thought the Declaration of Independence was even more important, because it showed that America was made up of separate states, not just one big country.",
            "Listen up, 'cause I gotta tell ya 'bout this project we had. Figure 17 shows us folks weren't fillin' out them commuter logs like they used to. Kinda bummed me out, to be honest, 'cause I couldn't figure out why.  See, it was winter in New England, ya know, and folks ain't ridin' bikes or walkin' much when it's freezin' their butts off. December also means everyone's swamped with schoolwork and grades, so forgettin' about a log ain't exactly unheard of. Plus, December's when the holidays hit, and everyone's off vacationin' or visitin' family, so why'd they need to come to campus anyway?  Classes start back up in January, but that doesn't explain why folks weren't fillin' out them logs in February either. Maybe folks just got excited at the start, and then the spark died down.  \n\nWe tried to shake things up with the \"Carpool Challenge Week\" in March, kinda like a pep rally for carpoolin'.  Got folks submittin' logs again, but it was a real struggle to keep 'em goin'.  See, college life is all about breaks and holidays, and it's tough to get folks pumped about carpoolin' when they're busy havin' fun or just needin' a break.\n\nAnother thing is, folks love their cars. It's just how we are, ya know? So, to get 'em carpoolin', we had to bribe 'em with goodies. Gift cards to restaurants, coffee shops, and even a massage!  We even had some bigger stores throwin' in some goodies.  Think about it, though:  what if we had a shiny new bike, a fancy hybrid car, or even an electric car up for grabs? Maybe that'd get folks more excited.  We kinda stuck with the same ol' prizes, though.  If we'd upped the ante, maybe folks would have kept carpoolin' longer.",
            "Well lemme tell ya 'bout these fancy ETF things. They're like a basket of investments, kinda like them index funds, but you can buy 'em and sell 'em like regular stocks. You get the spread out risk of a whole bunch of stuff, but you can also do some fancy tricks like borrowing money to buy more or even betting against 'em. And the best part? They cost less to run than them mutual funds.\n\nNow, there's a catch, ya gotta pay a fee every time you buy or sell one, just like a stock.  And even though they sound great, you gotta make sure you're really getting that spread out risk they promise.  So I was lookin' at this ETF called IHF, and I figured I'd see if it was really worth it compared to just buyin' the biggest ten stocks inside it. \n\nIt turns out, IHF has ten biggies that make up most of what's inside. I figured, why not just buy those ten straight up?  So I did the math, and guess what? Buying just those ten stocks actually gives ya a better return and less risk than buyin' the whole IHF thing!\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' that's always gonna be the case, but it sure looks like it in this situation. It's like gettin' a bigger bang for your buck by just pickin' the best ten.",
            "This Edgar Allan Poe poem, \"Dream-Land,\" is one of his favorites. Poe uses the word \"Thulé\" a couple of times, and folks like Mabbott say he got it from Virgil. Virgil used it to talk about an island way up north, beyond Britain, that folks back then thought was the edge of the known world. Now, Virgil probably did use the word, but there's another writer Poe liked a lot, a German fella named Goethe, and some folks think Poe might have gotten the word from him too.\n\nThis is important because it shows Poe knew all about Goethe's writing. This guy, Karl J. Arndt, wrote a book comparing Poe's \"Politian\" to Goethe's \"Mignon\" and thinks Poe was really copying Goethe.\n\nYou see, Oxford says Goethe was a big deal, famous for writing a play called \"Faust.\" It's a long one, in two parts, with the first part coming out in 1808 and the second one right when Goethe died, in 1832.  Inside the second part of \"Faust\" is a little poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" It's about this king whose wife dies after giving him a special cup. He starts drinking a lot and crying over her. Eventually, he decides he wants to die too, gives his stuff to his kids, keeps the cup, walks to a cliff, throws the cup in the ocean, closes his eyes, and kicks the bucket.  The King of Thulé and the guy in Poe's poem are kinda similar, maybe like a dark twin of Poe's own sadness and how he used to drink too much.  \"Faust\" was also turned into a play by this guy, H P Grattan, in 1842, just a year before Poe used \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe uses \"Thulé\" twice in his writing. He uses \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" but in \"Dream-Land,\" he uses \"Thulé\" at the beginning and end of the poem, like bookends. You can almost think of \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" as going together. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker talks about this dark, lonely place called Thulé, where he's haunted by dead friends and everything is gray and lifeless.  You can see the same feelings in \"The King of Thulé,\" where Goethe's king is also lonely, lost, and doesn't want to live anymore. It's like Poe stepped right into Goethe's poem.\n\nGoethe was a big deal, and Poe would have known about him, especially since Poe loved Tennyson. When someone asked Poe if he admired Tennyson, he said, \"Yes, and Goethe!\" Aside from that connection to Tennyson, Poe would have read a lot of Goethe's stuff because it was being reprinted a lot after it first came out.",
            "So, this lady, Jennifer Palmer, took a spill in a grocery store 'cause some applesauce was left sittin' on the floor.  Now, she's sayin' the store manager, this Martin fella, knew about the spill,  heard about it twice, but didn't do nothin' about it for half an hour 'cause he was eatin' dinner.  She wants to sue him for damages, not just for her hurt, but 'cause she says he acted real mean and reckless.\n\nNow, the judge ain't gonna toss her case out right away. To get those extra damages, she's gotta prove Martin knew he was doin' somethin' dangerous, that he was basically messin' with folks' safety on purpose. She's gonna say, see, other folks had slipped and fallen there before, so Martin shoulda known better.  \n\nWhether he acted real bad, that's a bit harder to say. The judge might think it was just plain dumb, not necessarily mean, but it ain't lookin' good for Martin. \n\nHere's the deal: \n\nThis Rich Wayne, he works at the store, tells Martin about the applesauce spill around 5:00. Martin says he's on a break and doesn't wanna deal with it. Then, Mary Haddigan, another worker, tells Martin about the spill again at 5:15, same story from Martin.\n\nFinally, at 5:30, Palmer comes along, slips on that applesauce, and bam! Bad back.\n\nIt turns out, this ain't the first time folks have fallen in this store. Five times already that year, folks had gone down.  Palmer's sayin' Martin knew or shoulda known things were dangerous and didn't do nothin'.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya somethin'.  A few years back, I took this class on Islam, and we got into a real hollerin' match about whether it was a religion that wanted to bash yer head in or not.  Now, more than ever, that question's got me scratchin' my head.  Look at how things've changed since 9/11.  The media, they went from slammin' Islam and them extremists to coddlin' it like a baby.  I'll bet you a dang dollar we couldn't have had a fella like Barack Obama runnin' for president back then, what with his Muslim roots and all. \n\nNow, I gotta say, this story 'bout Muhammad, the prophet fella, it got me thinkin'.  See, I figured Muhammad was a real tough hombre, the kinda guy who'd take over tribes and force 'em to turn Muslim.  But this here biography, it paints him as some kind of martyr, misunderstood and humble.  Like folks just kinda wandered in, saw the light, and joined up.  Seems fishy to me, like they're tryin' to make him out to be somethin' he ain't.\n\nAnd get this, there's some real spooky similarities between Muhammad and Jesus.  Like when he turned some mutton and milk into enough for forty guys.  It's like they're tryin' to steal Jesus' thunder, makin' Muhammad look all holy and miraculous too.  Ain't that a kick in the pants?\n\nThen there's all these stories about folks convertin' on their own, but they're all secondhand accounts, hear-say, somethin' like \"So-and-so told me that So-and-so said...\"  Gives me the creeps, makes it all sound like a bunch of baloney.\n\nBut the thing that really gets my goat is how they try to make Muhammad out to be this sweet talkin', wise guy.  But history says somethin' different, and I just can't help but wonder if Muslims today know the real deal about how Muhammad came to power.",
            "Well, let me tell you somethin'.  After Jesus kicked the bucket, folks started preachin' about him in ways he probably wouldn't have liked.  Seems like Christianity got further and further from its roots over the years.  Nowadays, folks are gettin' more open-minded and wantin' things to change.  Some old-timers, though, they cling to the old ways and don't want nothin' new.  But they ain't gonna be the ones callin' the shots.  In time, more and more Christians are gonna want to go back to the basics, the stuff Jesus actually taught.  It might take a while, maybe even a hundred years or more, but it's gonna happen.  \n\nThink of it like rewindin' a tape.  We're gonna strip away all the extra stuff that got added over the years and get back to what Jesus was all about.  It's gonna start slow, but then it'll pick up steam.  Folks are gonna start thinkin' more like they did back when Jesus was around.  And guess what?  The churches, they'll be right there leadin' the way!  But instead of everyone bein' different, we'll all start thinkin' alike.  Like when different teams all join together to win a game.  \n\nHistory's full of these big turnarounds.  Remember when Christians were bein' persecuted by the Romans?  Well, look what happened!  The Romans became Christians themselves!  And in our own country, we went from slaves to leaders.   \n\nThis time, it's gonna be the same thing, only with religion.  We're gonna go back to the start, back to Jesus, and everybody's gonna be on the same page.   One thing that'll help this happen is folks startin' to see Jesus' words as somethin' more like a story, not just plain facts.   \n\nSo, what happened after Jesus?  Well, if you go way back, you see that it all started with Judaism.   They believed in one God, and they had these special books called the scriptures that they thought came from God.   The Jewish people weren't all on the same page, though.  There were different groups, like the Sadducees, the Pharisees, and the Essenes.  But they all shared some basic beliefs.",
            "You see, this book, \"The Jungle,\" it shows us that folks deep down, they're just out for themselves. They wanna make their lives as good as they can be, but they don't give a hoot about anyone less fortunate. It's all about lookin' out number one. Take those factory bosses, for example. They just wanna make their factories bigger and richer,  not a darn bit of care about who gets hurt in the process.  The book says it plain as day, these factories are like monsters, belchin' out smoke like it's nobody's business. They don't care about the people or the animals, just their bottom line. They're like those guys who drive their big trucks and don't even look when they pull out, runnin' over anything in their way. \n\nAnd those factory bosses, they don't care about their workers neither. They're just lookin' to squeeze every last penny they can out of 'em. They work 'em 'til they drop, then fire 'em without a second thought.  The whole place is just a mess of jealousy and hatred, everyone's lookin' out for themselves, 'cause nobody's lookin' out for 'em. These workers, they're like slaves, trapped in this system where they ain't got no rights. Unions are supposed to help, but they're just another bunch of guys lookin' to make a buck off the backs of the poor. You got folks workin' themselves to death, and nobody even cares. It's a real shame, a real travesty.",
            "So, this book writer, Fitzgerald, he's got tricks up his sleeve to make you feel a certain way about stuff.  He's like a magician with words, ya know? Sometimes he'll pair words together that don't usually go together, just to give ya a vibe. Other times, he picks a thing, like a color, and makes it mean somethin' special, then he uses that special meanin' to make ya feel somethin' about somethin' else.\n\nHe does this a lot with colors in his book *The Great Gatsby*. He's got these colors, like gold, green, white, gray, and red, and he gives 'em all these deep meanings. Then he uses 'em to make ya remember how somethin' makes ya feel.\n\nTake white and gray, for example. He makes 'em mean somethin' like sameness, like everything's the same. White's a bit nicer, fancier, while gray's more old and faded, ya know?\n\nHe shows ya this right from the start, with everyone wearin' white. Daisy and Jordan, they're always in white. Heck, even Nick's wearin' white to Gatsby's party! And Tom's got on a white shirt when he meets Myrtle.  The only time folks ain't wearin' white is when Nick's at Gatsby's party, and then it's all these loud, bright colors.\n\nFitzgerald uses these colors everywhere, like when Nick goes to work, he goes down these \"white chasms\" in New York.  And the names at Gatsby's party? They're all just \"gray names.\"  Even Catherine's apartment building looks like a big white cake, all the same.\n\nHe even uses white and gray for regular folks and places. Jordan and Daisy had a \"white girlhood.\" There are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in that depressing valley of ashes.  \n\nFitzgerald keeps us thinkin' about these colors, buildin' up this whole feelin' for 'em. Then, when he wants ya to think somethin' ain't important, or it's just part of the crowd, he uses white or gray.\n\nTake Daisy, for example. After he's been using these colors everywhere, he describes Daisy all in white, in her white car. Suddenly, she doesn't seem so special anymore, just like somethin' Gatsby wants, somethin' uniform, like a pretty package. \n\nHe does this with Daisy a few more times, makin' her seem more like a pretty picture than a real person. She's got a \"gray haze\" around her neck, and she's wearin' white again before that big showdown with Tom and Gatsby.",
            "Well, let me tell ya, San Diego's a pretty darn good place to grow stuff. That sunshine and mild weather? Makes for some mighty fine tomatoes, citrus, and all sorts of veggies. You got your squash, your broccoli, herbs galore, even peaches and lemons. And don't forget the berries and peppers!\n\nSeems like folks around here are real keen on their organic eats too. There's a whole heap of folks signed up for community-supported agriculture, waiting for their share of that fresh-picked goodness. And eggs and milk? Organic all the way, folks!\n\nA lot of these farms, they ain't just about the crops. They let you take a gander at how they do things, even go for a hike or watch the birds. Seems like a good way to make a livin' while helpin' out the environment, ya know?\n\nNow, organic farming ain't always easy. It takes a lot more elbow grease to keep those pests and weeds at bay without all the fancy chemicals. Plus, crops sometimes don't do as well as with the regular stuff. But, it sure does do wonders for the critters and plants around here. More biodiversity, that's what they call it.\n\nBut hold on, there's more to it!  These folks makin' a go of it with wildlife in mind, they gotta do all sorts of extra work. Plantin' special cover crops, makin' sure the animals have a good place to graze, even gettin' rid of those pesky invasives.  \n\nSo, this landowner I was talkin' about, he's got a real pickle on his hands. He wants to make a decent livin' and help the critters out too. That takes some know-how and a little help, ya see.\n\nThis land he's lookin' at, it's out near Potrero, a real beautiful spot.  It's got chaparral, grassland, and oak trees, all right next to that Cleveland National Forest.  They're sayin' there's all sorts of critters livin' there, some endangered, some just hangin' on.\n\nBeen sayin' this land's been around for ages, first the Native Americans, then some ranchers and folks sellin' firewood. Back in the day, this was a homestead, so it was probably used for grazin' or choppin' wood.\n\nNow, I found this piece of property online and figured out what kind of help this farmer might be able to get. I even found a real organic farm nearby, doin' pretty much what I'm talkin' about.",
            "Listen, everybody knows culture matters when you're tryin' to get somethin' done.  It ain't just about what a culture is, but what it ain't, you know?  It's not like everyone in a place is the same, like sayin' all Rednecks are stubborn or all them fancy Japanese are always playin' it nice.  That's just plain dumb talk.  \n\nWhat you gotta do is figure out how that culture's gonna play out in the deal you're makin'.  You see the world through your own eyes, and it's natural to compare, but you gotta go deeper than that.\n\nThink about it like this:  when you're dealin' with folks from a different place, you gotta learn their history, their hang-ups, the things they think are important.  Don't go tryin' to change 'em, just gotta respect it.  It's like when you're on someone else's turf - you gotta play by their rules, especially if you're the one with less to offer.  Treat 'em right, show 'em respect for their ways, and you'll get further.\n\nAnd it ain't just countries, you know.  Inside any big company, there's a whole culture goin' on.  Some places are all about workin' 'til you drop, others are laid back.  How they dress, how they talk, who they hire - it all tells ya somethin' about their culture.  Some companies encourage helpin' others, others are all about makin' money.  Just look around you - there's all kinds of different ways to do business.\n\nValues are the real key though.  They're the heart of a culture, the reason everything else is the way it is.  If a culture cares about lookin' good or gettin' along, they ain't gonna embarrass their boss to win a deal.  If they're all about makin' a tough bargain, they ain't gonna cave easy.  \n\nSo, before you walk into any kinda negotiation, do your homework.  Figure out the culture, what they stand for, what makes 'em tick.  And don't forget, get to know the folks you're dealin' with on a personal level too.  That's how you really make a deal.",
            "Dang ol' psalm talkin' about how folks say there ain't no God, right?  Well, that's what Anselm and Aquinas are tryin' to prove wrong.  They both believe in the same God, the one from the Bible.  Now, we gotta figure out whose argument makes more sense, so we're gonna pretend they're both right about God existin'. \n\nAnselm, he thinks we gotta look inside ourselves to find God.  He says since we can think about God, He must be real.  Kinda like, if you can picture a dang ol' redneck in a pickup truck, that means there's gotta be rednecks in pickup trucks out there, right?  Anselm's sayin' that God's gotta be real 'cause we can think about Him.  He calls it faith, I reckon.\n\nAquinas, he's a different kinda fella.  He thinks we can prove God exists with logic and stuff, like lookin' at the world and sayin', \"Hey, this ain't just happenin' by itself, there's gotta be a reason!\"  He's got five different reasons, but they all boil down to sayin' that God makes sense, ya know?\n\nBoth of 'em got some good points, but neither one of 'em really convinces me that God's gotta be real.",
            "Alright, so there was this dude, right? Way back in the day, like 5 or 600 BC, he was born a prince. But this dude, the one they'd later call Buddha, he decided to ditch the fancy life and go all spiritual. He figured out some stuff about how the world works, and his ideas started this whole religion called Buddhism. Now, the most straight-up kind of Buddhism is called Theravada, and it's been around for about 2,500 years. Things have changed a bit since Buddha was around, you know?\n\nLike, in Sri Lanka, these guys still do this big water-cutting ceremony every year. Monks and regular folks, they all join in, and it's kinda important to them, even though Buddha never mentioned anything about it. It's like that with a lot of stuff in Theravada Buddhism—some stuff's changed from the old days, both the little stuff and the big stuff.  The monks and the regular folks who follow Buddhism, they've had to tweak their ideas a bit over time. It's like, life changes things, ya know?\n\nWe gotta talk about some words a lot in this here story. We're gonna say things like \"internal\" and \"external,\" and \"hostile\" and \"benign.\" Think of it this way: \"internal\" means something coming from inside the Buddhist group, whether you're a monk or not. \"External\" means something coming from folks outside of Buddhism. \"Hostile\" means something bad for Buddhism, like someone trying to mess it up. \"Benign\" means something that's not trying to help or hurt Buddhism, but might end up doing one or the other by accident.\n\nFirst things first, let's get the basics of Theravada Buddhism down. Buddhists put their faith in the \"Triple Gem\"—the Buddha, his teachings (the Dhamma), and the community of Buddhists (the Sangha). The Dhamma is like a big library of Buddhist writings called the \"Tripitaka.\"  There's the Sutta Pitaka with all the Buddha's teachings, the Vinaya Pitaka with the rules for monks, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka with the deep, philosophical stuff about Buddhism.\n\nThey talk about things like Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (suffering), and Anicca (everything changes).  They think that by understanding these things, you can escape Sansara, which is like a big wheel of life, death, and being reborn over and over.  And when you get out of that wheel, you get rid of Lobha (desire), Dosa (hatred), and Moha (delusion). That's when you become enlightened.",
            "Listen, you ever hear about how the US and Mexico used to be like cat and dog, fightin' over everything?  They were at odds for like 57 years straight!  Back in the 1840s, we even went to war with 'em over Texas and parts of the Southwest.  It was a real mess, folks.  They call it the Mexican-American War, and we kicked their butts good.  But it weren't just that one fight, see?  They kept buttin' heads over things like religion, their way of life, and all sorts of stuff.  Kinda like how neighbors might argue over a fence or somethin'. \n\nThis ain't nothin' new, though.  Countries that live next to each other, they tend to get into it sometimes.  Look at us and Cuba, or even with Canada sometimes.  It's just how things go.  You got some folks sayin' that we've had more trouble with Mexico and Cuba than any other country.  Maybe they got a point.\n\nNow, religion played a big part in all this.  Back then, Americans didn't like Catholics much, and Mexicans, well, they were Catholic as can be.  Just like the Cold War, where we were against Russia 'cause of their communism, it was kinda like that, but with religion instead.  It ain't easy when you got different beliefs, you know?\n\nThese two countries, they had a lot of spats back then.  Mostly about land, and bandits crossin' the border and causin' trouble.  It took both sides sendin' in the troops to finally put a stop to it.  Eventually, though, things cooled down.  Mexico started dependin' on us more and more, and we weren't so interested in takin' their land anymore.",

            "Victorian novels are known for their super detailed descriptions and their focus on the rich and fancy folks back then. But there are a couple of books from that time, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, that don't quite fit that mold. They're kinda spooky and a little weird, which is different from most novels from that era. This weirdness actually makes the characters more interesting, giving us a better understanding of what makes them tick.\n\nTake this passage from Oliver Twist:\n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\nThese books often use mystery and dream-like scenes to do this, but they do it in different ways. In Oliver Twist, these strange happenings show us what's going on inside Oliver's head, his pain, and how he sees the world around him. When Oliver gets shot, he relives it all over again in a dream-like state as he tries to find help. \n\nThis passage shows how out of control Oliver feels.  He's overwhelmed, and his pain is constant and linked with fear, not just shock.  It makes you wonder who's really in charge of his fate, because it's definitely not him.  He doesn't even try to fight back, even when his life is on the line.  This makes you think that maybe he's starting to give up hope, like Fagin has broken him and made him accept this miserable fate.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.\"",
            "A couple years back, I was workin' in this after-school program, helpin' out little kids with their schoolwork. I was pretty good at English and readin', so I'd help out with whatever those kids were strugglin' with. One time, they asked me to help this little fella named Adrian, maybe in third or fourth grade. He was havin' a real tough time readin'. I mean, it was just plain weird. Some letters he'd get right, but others, he'd butcher 'em somethin' fierce.\n\nYou see, Adrian was Latino, spoke perfect English, but his readin' was all messed up. We were hittin' a wall, I mean, I didn't know what to do! Then one day, Adrian's momma came to pick him up. Now, she didn't speak a lick of English. Just Spanish. I could barely spit out a few words myself, but we managed to get by. And that's when it hit me like a ton of bricks: Adrian could read just fine, he just didn't know the English alphabet that well. \n\nI ain't sure if that helped him much, but I sure do hope he's doin' better now. \n\nI tell that story 'cause it shows ya, there's this big ol' language barrier in schools, especially here in California. It ain't always as obvious as ya think. Even if a kid speaks English good, readin' it can be a real headache.\n\nWe all know this problem exists, so what can we do about it? In Adrian's case, it was easy: tutor him in English readin', teach him the alphabet and how to pronounce things right. But for kids who barely speak English, it's a whole different ball game. There ain't just one answer, ya know? Dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes, nothin' works all on its own. We gotta throw everything at it!\n\nDual language programs are a good start. Not just for Spanish speakers, but for everyone.  It's like, kids in these programs do better in school than the rest. Some folks are scared of it, think it wastes money and ain't good for everyone. That's hogwash! If we made these programs the norm, not the exception, everyone would benefit. \n\nBut how do we do it? Make every teacher bilingual? Nah, that's crazy talk. But we could have bilingual assistants, tutors, whatever ya wanna call 'em, to help out.",
            "Man, ever since we were little kids, folks told us there's somethin' bigger out there, somethin' we can't even wrap our heads around. Some go to church, some go to temple, some just try to figure it out on their own. A lot of us just go with what our folks taught us, but some folks, they say \"heck no!\", they don't believe in nothin' but what they can see right in front of 'em.  We might believe in one thing one day, then change our minds the next.  No matter what, we're all lookin' for somethin' to give our lives meaning, somethin' to light the way when things get dark.\n\nMy dad, he loved cardinals. I asked him once, sittin' on the porch, rain comin' down like crazy. We were smokin' cigarettes, my dad lookin' thin and tired, his hair gettin' sparser by the day. He just stared out at the rain, thinkin' about somethin', I guess.  I felt kinda lost, scared, and couldn't bring myself to say nothin' 'bout how much I was gonna miss him, 'cause talkin' about it would just make it all too real. So I hugged him, sat closer, and just watched the rain with him.\n\n\nMy dad passed away that December, just a few days after I turned 22.  They tried to help him with chemo and radiation, but it just kept him alive longer, even though he was sufferin'. I couldn't figure out what good that was doin'. What kind of God would let somethin' like that happen, I thought.  I didn't pray, 'cause I figured God had stopped listenin' to me a long time ago.\n\nI didn't wanna watch him die. I couldn't. I wanted to remember him how he was, not how he died. Besides, I knew him better than anyone else, better than his family even. I knew he wouldn't want me standin' there watchin' him go.  So I just curled up in bed for three days, waitin' for the news. \n\nNo one even called me.",
            "So, this whole \"Gothic Novel\" thing, it's kinda like a head-scratcher.  You got this fancy name, \"Gothic,\" but it's like sayin' somethin' that's both old and new at the same time.  This fella, Ian Watt, he says it best in his book about how Gothic novels came to be.  Folks have been talkin' smack about 'em, praisin' 'em to the heavens, sayin' they ain't got nothin' goin' on, then turnin' around and sayin' they're pure genius.  It's a real mixed bag, this Gothic stuff. \n\nIt all started with this guy, Horace Walpole, and his book, \"The Castle of Otranto.\"  He mixed up these old-timey stories with the newfangled novels folks were writin' back then.  He called it \"A Gothic Story,\" and it was somethin' new, somethin' different.  Gothic novels, they got all this stuff from those old medieval plays and castles, and all those fancy traditions.  Back when Walpole wrote his book, people were already throwin' around the word \"Gothic\" for all sorts of things, but it usually meant somethin' old-fashioned or kinda dumb compared to all the newfangled stuff everyone thought was so much better.  But by puttin' these old Gothic ideas into a new kind of story, somethin' where you got right inside the characters' heads, somethin' new and powerful happened.  Gothic stuck around for a long time, even though it felt both old and brand new at the same time.\n\nOne big thing about Gothic is this idea of chivalry.  You know, knights and all that.  In those old days, they trained these knights to be brave, honorable, all that jazz.  Gothic writers, well, they liked that idea a lot, 'cause they felt like folks weren't so chivalrous anymore.  So they used those old knightly ideas to make the past seem better than the present.  It's like sayin', \"Hey, back in the day, folks were awesome, but now everyone's messed up!\"\n\nWalpole, he wrote \"The Castle of Otranto\" when things were kinda crazy politically.  He was worried about the future, and maybe felt like folks had lost their way.  In his book, he shows this character, Frederic, who's supposed to be this perfect knight.  He's got all the fancy words and descriptions, like he's straight outta a medieval fairytale.  Walpole's tryin' to make you think, \"Wow, back in the day, these guys were somethin' special!\"",
            "Well, lemme tell ya 'bout this here supply chain thingy.  It's like a big ol' chain, see? Starts with the customer, when they want somethin'.  Gotta get them raw materials, make the stuff, then ship it right back to the customer.  A fella named Keith Oliver, back in '82, came up with the name, said it's all about plannin', doin', and keepin' track of everything so the customer gets what they want, fast and cheap.  \n\nThere's six main parts to this chain, see: makin' it, gettin' it, keepin' track of it, where it's at, how it gets moved, and all the info about it.  Managers gotta use all these parts to make the customers happy.\n\nFirst up is makin' the stuff, that's the heart of the whole thing.  Gotta figure out what to make, how much, where, and how to do it.  Look at what folks are buyin', that's your clue what they want.  Lots of talk about the market, fancy word for what people are buyin'.  Once you know what to make, gotta decide where to make it, gotta be the right place for makin' that kinda stuff good and right.  Then it's schedulin' who does what, and keepin' the machines workin'.  Don't mess this part up, it'll cost ya in the long run!\n\nUsed to work at Walmart and Target, both got all sorts of rules and booklets for everything, from how an employee's uniform should look to how to unload trucks.  Gotta have it all figured out so everyone knows what they're doin'.\n\nThen comes gettin' the stuff, see, gotta figure out where to get all the parts and stuff to make the product.  You might have different places makin' different parts, gotta figure out who's best for what.  Sometimes you gotta hire other companies to help, that's callin' it \"outsourcing\".  Doin' this makes things faster and cheaper, but do it right, or you'll end up payin' more.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya somethin'. This here Ellen Page, she's a pretty little thing, ain't she?  She was standin' on a street corner, holidin' up this sign, right? And it said somethin' real messed up: \"Hitler is alive in Burma!\"  Now, Burma, that's a place way over yonder, kinda like the wild west, but with more temples and less tumbleweeds. They got this bunch of tough guys runnin' things, callin' themselves the junta, and they ain't afraid to use force if folks start gettin' uppity.  \n\nA few years back, these monks, they started protestin', wearin' their saffron robes, lookin' all peaceful and stuff. But the junta, they didn't like it. They started crackin' down hard, beatin' folks up, even killin' some. It was a real mess. They even locked up some fellas just for tryin' to take pictures of what was goin' on. \n\nNow, this ain't the first time somethin' like this has happened.  Governments, they always want to be in charge, ain't they?   Like those Roman emperors, thinkin' they were gods.  And don't even get me started on those Japanese emperors, thinkin' they're gods too! And let's not forget ol' George W. Bush, talkin' to that Ted Haggard fella, leader of the Dumb Folks Club.  \n\nWe had that Tiananmen Square thing back in the day, where a bunch of folks got together, and the Chinese government, well, let's just say they didn't handle it real well. And then there was that Rwanda mess, where they went and killed a whole bunch of people just 'cause they were different. And who can forget ol' Hitler, with his whole \"Final Solution\" thing?\n\nIt's enough to make a fella want to move to Mars, ain't it?",
            "Duke Ellington was a jazz legend, and one reason why is he stuck around so long and kept making new music. He really knew how to shape his band, making 'em sound like a real family. \n\nNow, you might not hear Ellington playing the piano a whole lot in some of his songs, but he was a whiz at writing music that was both fancy and deep. He'd give his guys room to show off their skills, letting 'em improvise, but he also knew how to write tight sections where everyone had to play just right.  He was like a conductor, makin' sure every instrument sounded good together,  creating somethin' fresh and new every time. Because of this, he wrote some of the best jazz music ever.\n\nThis one music book says he was always tryin' new things, like using voices as instruments. Check out \"Creole Love Call\", where he uses a voice to add some texture to the music without actually singin' any words.  He was always findin' ways to make his musicians shine, and this song shows it. It's a slow blues song where the voice and the woodwinds take turns talkin' to each other. The trumpet player does some fancy stuff, the clarinet player soars high, and the whole band comes together in the end. It's a real showstopper, and you can hear how much Ellington cared about makin' each part sound perfect.\n\nHe did the same thing in another song called \"Hot and Bothered\". He had a trumpet player named \"Bubber\" and a singer named Baby Cox, and they'd go back and forth, makin' their voices and instruments sound like one. It was like a conversation, kinda funny and kinda soulful. Then there's \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\", where he uses a trombone player named \"Tricky Sam\" to start the song. This guy was a regular in Ellington's band, and he played that trombone like nobody's business.",
            "She'd always felt like somethin' was missin', like there was a hole in her life that nothin' seemed to fill. This need started when she was about 14, just a young'un, and it was still there three years later, at 17. By then, she figured out she wanted someone, not some material thing.  But she just wasn't interested in any fellas. Some tried to court her, makin' all them awkward moves, but nobody really caught her eye. She wondered about herself a lot, tryin' to figure out why this was happenin' to her.  She thought about it for a few years, tryin' to come up with answers, but nothin' really stuck. So she just kept on livin', always wonderin' about what she really wanted.\n\nHer days at home were usually pretty peaceful.  Her folks were good, quiet folks.  They never fought, and strangely enough, they hardly ever argued with her either. The only time they ever clashed was when she tried to show 'em she was her own person. She was the daughter of two calm souls, but she sure did bring the energy with her big, fun personality. She was a likeable gal, and that personality sure didn't hurt.\n\nBut today wasn't a calm day.  She was wanderin' around the house, lookin' for somethin' to inspire her, when she heard a little scream from the kitchen. It was her mama's voice, and it sounded scared. She ran in, panic settin' in, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\"  \n\nHer mama was on the floor, holdin' herself, lettin' out little \"Ow\"s every time she breathed. Her daughter rushed to her side, puttin' a hand on her. \"Ouch... sweety, I... need you to take me to... the hospital.\" Her words were rushed and strained. Her daughter knew right then, her mama was hurt bad.  \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" \n\nHer mama pointed her hand, and her daughter, grateful she'd taken those strength trainin' classes, scooped her mama up and carried her to the car. She laid her down in the back, and they drove off.\n\nThe hospital smelled like medicine and sickness, kinda scary, but she wasn't feelin' that. She was too busy worryin' about her mama. She rushed her inside and shouted for help.  A few worried faces gathered around, someone grabbed a gurney and laid mama down on it. They took her away, and her daughter sat there, waitin' and worryin'.\n\nTurns out, her mama had fallen off a step stool while tryin' to reach a vase from the top shelf.",
            "Y'all know how they talk about that \"Mediterranean Diet\"?  Well, this study wanted to see if eatin' like folks in the Mediterranean really keeps your ticker tickin' strong.  \n\nThey call it the \"aMed diet\" - it's like the Mediterranean Diet's cousin, but with more plants, good fats, and fish.  Less of that red meat and greasy stuff, ya know?  And a little wine ain't gonna hurt ya, neither.\n\nNow, folks have been sayin' for a while that eatin' this way keeps ya outta the hospital, but nobody really looked at strokes before.  This study followed a bunch of nurses for 20 years -  over 70,000 of 'em! -  and they asked 'em about what they ate every few years.  They wanted to see if the nurses who ate more like folks in the Mediterranean had fewer heart attacks and strokes.\n\nTurns out, they did!  The nurses who ate the healthiest, they had less heart problems and strokes compared to the others. It's like a magic shield against those nasty heart attacks and strokes.",
            "You know, back in 2007, America took a real nosedive. Jobs went poof, houses weren't worth nothin', and even the big ol' companies were goin' belly up. This mess, it's still hangin' around like a bad smell, so we gotta figure out what went wrong, right? Well, lemme tell ya, it all started with some real dumb decisions made by folks in these fancy suits in Washington. They were pressurin' banks and businesses to hand out loans to folks who couldn't afford 'em, like givin' candy to a bunch of sugar-crazed kids. Meanwhile, these government fellas, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, they were gettin' pressured to bundle up all these bad loans and sell 'em off like hotcakes. When folks started missin' their payments, the whole thing went kablooey. Banks were broke, folks lost their homes, and the whole darn economy went south faster than a greased pig at a county fair.\n\nSee, this whole mess started back in 1999, when Bill Clinton was still in the White House. He was lookin' to get re-elected, so he loosened up the rules on loans, thinkin' he could buy himself another term. Well, bless his heart, he didn't see the trouble comin'.  A fella named Steven Holmes over at the New York Times, he saw right through it. He was sayin' back then that Fannie Mae, the big mortgage bank, was gettin' pushed too hard to make loans to folks who couldn't afford 'em. He even said it might lead to another financial disaster like what happened in the 80s with the savings and loans.  Boy, was he right!\n\nThey started makin' these fancy new mortgages, with adjustable rates and all sorts of bells and whistles.  Folks were buyin' houses faster than you can say \"open house,\" and nobody thought nothin' of it.  But it was all a big ol' bubble, just waitin' to burst. And burst it did! When the housing market crashed, all those fancy mortgages went south, and the whole financial system went with 'em.  Big banks were in trouble, folks were losin' their homes, and the economy was tankin' faster than a greased pig at a county fair.",
            "Ok, so you're writin' a story, right? And you gotta get all the backstory out there, the kinda stuff that tells folks who these characters are and what's goin' on.  That's what folks call exposition, I reckon. But lemme tell ya, too much exposition can make your story about as exciting as a bowl of dry cereal. \n\nIt's like when you're talkin' to your buddy and just keepin' on blabbin' about your day, and he's just lookin' at you like, \"Can we get to the good part already?\"  \n\nYou see, folks like to see things happen, not just hear about 'em. Instead of sayin' \"This fella was a real heartbreaker, he had a whole bunch of girlfriends,\" show 'em!  Let 'em see him charm the socks off some dame or make a gal blush with a wink. \n\nSame goes for that gal who lost her man.  Instead of just sayin' she was heartbroken, show her cryin' her eyes out, or maybe picturing him in her mind, or even gettin' back into the swing of things with a new hobby.\n\nIt's all about makin' 'em feel somethin', ya know?  You gotta give 'em somethin' to sink their teeth into.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya 'bout these newscasts I watched from Columbus, Ohio. I caught the NBC 4 one this mornin', August 13th, 2011.  Their big story was 'bout this fella in Ashley, Ohio, named Shad Hostettler who stabbed his wife - didn't say her name though. They showed his picture, and lemme tell ya, the guy looked like pure evil! They only spent a couple minutes on it, 'cause it was still unfoldin', but they said he stabbed her a whole bunch and got busted. Seems like they covered it just right.\n\nThen they had a story 'bout a young fella, Travis Buyers, 18 years old, shot in the Sharon Woods area.  He was real bad off, no arrests yet, SWAT team lookin' into it. Seemed kinda rushed, and it made me think, ya know, maybe it's 'cause he was a black man or livin' in a black neighborhood. I've noticed for years, the media don't give minorities the same attention when they're hurt. If it's a white kid or grown-up, they go crazy, but a minority, they're lucky to even get a mention.\n\nNext up was a story about a .22 bullet hittin' a Med-Flight chopper. They figured out where it happened and everything. Crime Stoppers was offerin' five grand for any info leadin' to the shooter.\n\nThen they threw in a quick one 'bout rain and thunderstorms comin' on Saturday. They said it'd be in the eighties all weekend.  They kept it short, probably to get ya hooked for more.\n\nThey also had a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road. Said the guy was black, wearin' a hoodie, about six foot tall and one hundred and fifty pounds.  They kept hammerin' on 'bout him bein' black and how dark he was. Seemed kinda strange to me.\n\nFinally, they talked 'bout this Rene Rodriguez, some drug kingpin from Texas.  Convicted of sendin' tons of weed to Ohio.  Instead of sayin' he got twenty-five years, they said \"300 months.\"  Maybe they thought that sounded scarier or somethin'.  They also mentioned he was Hispanic, but that didn't really seem important to the story.",
            "Brothers, man, they're somethin' else.  Ya know, there's this crazy bond between 'em, like nothin' else. It's filled with all kinds of stuff: love, pride, jealousy, even anger sometimes.  Brothers get each other, more than anyone else, like lookin' in a mirror. You see yourself in 'em, the good and the bad. And when things get tough, that bond really shows its true colors, for better or worse.  It's a heavy thing, that bond, and it comes with a price.  \n\nYa gotta understand, when you look at your brother, you see yourself, not how folks see you, but the real you.  What you do, and what happens because of it, that's your true character. This story, \"The Scarlet Ibis\", it's all about that, about these two brothers and all the crazy stuff they feel for each other.\n\nThis story takes place in a beautiful, lush place, but these boys, they're on a trip that ain't gonna end well. There's this big clash between disappointment and pride, and in the end, only one brother makes it out alive. The story shows you the brother's feelings through the main character, Doodle, and how he acts.  It's like lookin' into his head, seein' how he feels about everything, and how that shapes his actions.\n\nThis brother, he's all about pride, from the moment he and Doodle first head out together, right up to that last, bad trip. He wanted a brother he could teach all sorts of things to, like how to hold his breath, run, jump, climb trees, all that.  He wanted someone to race with, someone to hang out with. But Doodle, he was born different, with a weak heart.  It was like his dreams were crushed right there. The poor kid was never gonna be able to do any of that stuff. This brother, he even thought about smotherin' Doodle, can you believe it? That's some dark stuff. But then Doodle smiles at him, and his heart melts.  See, deep down, he loved his brother, even if he didn't always show it.",
            "Now listen up, cuz the brain is a right tricky thing, kinda like tryin' to figure out how a dang tractor works. Back in the day, folks thought it was like a wax tablet, then a scroll, then a book. Nowadays, they say it's like a computer. But just remember, these ol' sayings ain't always right, kinda like sayin' a 2x4 is gonna solve all your problems.\n\nSo here's the deal: you got all these senses, right? They're like little spies, tellin' your brain about the world - touchin' stuff, hearin' noises, seein' colors. Your brain takes all that info and shuffles it around, makin' sense of it all. It's like buildin' a picture outta jigsaw pieces, startin' with the little bits and then puttin' 'em together to see the whole thing. Sometimes it's like, \"Hey, that's a box!\" and other times it's like, \"Hold on, is that a box or a hole?\"  Your brain's always guessin' and chewin' on things.\n\nNow your brain's got this filter, kinda like a bouncer at a club. It decides what's important and what can be tossed aside. You see a whole bunch of blades of grass, but your brain's like, \"Nah, ain't worth payin' attention to those.\" But if someone says your name, bam! Your brain's all ears.\n\nTo remember stuff, your brain's got these storerooms: short-term memory, where things hang out for a bit, and long-term memory, where things stick around for good. It's like puttin' stuff in a filing cabinet, but your brain does it all with electricity and chemicals, which is way more complicated than me tryin' to organize my toolshed.\n\nNow, folks try to figure out how all this knowledge is organized in your brain, kinda like tryin' to map out a big ol' maze. Some say it's like a web, where ideas are connected to each other. And that makes sense, cuz think about it - \"chair\" is connected to \"table,\" \"table\" is connected to \"wood,\" and so on.  It's all tangled up, just like life itself!",
            "Now listen, this Huxley fella, he's got somethin' to say about all this fancy tech and the whole money-grubbin' system we got goin' on.  He wrote this book, \"Brave New World,\" and it's a real downer. These people, they ain't got no individuality. They're all about bein' part of the crowd and gettin' their kicks right now, no matter what. They're just pawns in a game played by this big-shot World Controller. \n\nSee, this book, it makes ya think about all that Marxist stuff, ya know, the class struggle and all that. Huxley was suspicious about all this progress and how it messes with regular folks.  He's talkin' about how the rich folks keep the poor folks dumb and happy,  makin' 'em think they're doin' alright when they ain't.  It's like they're hypnotized into just buyin' and buyin', never questionin' nothin'.\n\nThe World Controller, he's like the big boss man, pullin' all the strings. He makes sure the folks are happy, but only in a shallow way.  They got all this stuff, but no real connection to each other.  It's all about appearances and instant gratification.\n\nAnd the people, they're just puppets. They don't even know they're bein' controlled. They just go along with it, thinkin' they're livin' the good life.  \n\nIt's kinda like what Marx said about the rich guys exploitin' the poor guys.  They keep 'em busy with distractions, makin' 'em think they're better off than they really are.  \n\nHuxley's book is a warning, y'know? He's sayin' that if we keep goin' down this path, we're gonna lose our freedom and our humanity. We gotta wake up and see what's really goin' on before it's too late.",
            "Well, I've been slummin' it here at University Park for about two and a half years now, four and a half semesters if you wanna get technical. Let me tell ya, gettin' around this campus is a real pain in the neck, and I ain't talkin' about the dang squirrels! My freshman year, they stuck me in one of those East Halls dorms,  like way out east, past the football stadium and that big ol' Bryce Jordan Center.  To get to my classes, man, you'd think I was crossin' the Sahara Desert!  Willard building, right smack in the middle of campus, felt like it was a hundred miles away. Walkin' there in the rain, which happens more often than not in State College,  could take you 25 minutes, easy. I talked to this old grad, not much older than me, and he told me those East Halls used to be way out in the boonies, surrounded by nothin' but empty land. Now it's all fancy sports fields, new buildings like that new Creamery and the health center, and apartments everywhere.  Seems like they're buildin' somethin' new every day, but nothin' to help us get around!\n\nNow, what's the answer to this transportation mess?  A bicycle, that's what!  But it ain't just about havin' a bike, ya know?  Students gotta use 'em, and the campus needs to be built with bikes in mind.\n\nI was talkin' to my buddy, he got back into ridin' after takin' a break for a few years. He said, \"Forget about it, bikes are the only way to go!  It ain't cool to ride bikes anymore, but it's the dang fastest way to get around.\" Besides bein' good for ya, it's the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little peddlin' and you can go 30 miles, easy.  I live off campus now, just as far from the center of campus as some dorms, and the best decision I made all year was buyin' a bike.  I take classes in Thomas building, a good 25-minute walk from my house.  On a bike, I can get there in 5 minutes flat if I pedal like a madman.\n\nThe only problem is, Pollock Road, the shortcut to Thomas, ain't always the easiest ride, bike or not.  Walkin' ain't bad, but I'm too busy for that. Without my bike, walkin' is my only option, and that's a whole lotta time wasted."
