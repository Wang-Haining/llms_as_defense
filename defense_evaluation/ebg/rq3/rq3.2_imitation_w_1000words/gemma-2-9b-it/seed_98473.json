            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "Well, lemme tell ya, I'm gonna be a social worker, helpin' out them poor kids who got mistreated, ya know? And I'll be workin' with families who are havin' a hard time.  I reckon I got a few things to offer this social work gig, like bein' helpful, treatin' folks right, doin' things the right way, and tryin' to make things better between people. And I'm talkin' 'bout makin' myself better too, so I can do my job real good.\n\nTruth be told, I always wanted to help folks out, but I wasn't sure how.  In high school and college, I saw folks runnin' from their problems, avoidin' 'em like the plague. Some tried to cope, but not real good, if ya catch my drift. I even got a degree in psychology from Piedmont College back in '09, just tryin' to figure things out.\n\nThen one summer, I met this sixteen-year-old kid, nervous as a cat in a room full of rocking chairs. My friend told me he was runnin' from his abusive parents. The next day, I found out he called the cops on 'em. So, I figured I'd see what I could do, so I went over to their house. I talked to the cops, told 'em I was a psychology grad from Piedmont. They asked me to talk to the parents 'cause there wasn't much they could do for the kid. When I questioned 'em, they were all jumpy and makin' excuses about their son bein' manipulative for gettin' the cops involved. That's when I knew, I gotta be a social worker, helpin' kids caught in these family messes.\n\nAnother thing that's important to me is social justice.  We say we value each person, but sometimes it feels like we just want everyone to be the same. I'm me, and I ain't afraid to be different.  Back in school, I protested against injustice whenever I could.  Colored my hair crazy colors, wore what I wanted, pierced my ears, joined that GSBA group, stood up against racism and discrimination. I believe in social justice, and I'll keep fightin' for it.",
            "Alright, so this here paper's gonna talk about two ways of lookin' at insomnia - the \"sciencey\" way and the \"people and their surroundings\" way.\n\nThe sciencey way, they call it the biological model, focuses on stuff like your genes and your overall health. It's all about how your body's wired to sleep and what happens when things go wrong. \n\nThen there's the \"people and their surroundings\" way, which is called the sociocultural model. This one looks at how your environment, your family, your neighborhood, and even your job can affect your sleep. \n\nThis paper's gonna go through both these models and talk about some studies that tried to figure out how they work.  We'll also talk about the good and bad parts of each study, ya know, like what they got right and where they might have missed the mark.\n\nNow, sleep problems can come in all shapes and sizes. Sometimes they're just about sleep itself - like trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. Other times, they're connected to other stuff going on in your head, like stress or anxiety. And sometimes they're caused by medical conditions or things you're taking.\n\nThe paper's gonna focus mainly on insomnia, which is that trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. It'll also touch on other sleep problems that are similar.\n\nOne study looked at something called the GABAB receptor. Turns out, this little fella in your brain is important for sleep.  They did some experiments on mice, and found that messing with this receptor can mess with their sleep.  It's kinda like a light switch for sleep. \n\nSo what does this mean for us humans?

What was that?\" \n\nNow, back in the day, folks called it \"auditory imperception,\" like it was some kinda secret code. But these smart folks started figuring out that it wasn't just kids not paying attention, it was their brains messing up the sound signals. They started doing tests to see how people's brains handled sounds, like trying to tell apart two words said at the same time. \n\nSo, what happens when someone's got CAPD? Well, they might have a hard time telling where a sound is coming from, or they might mix up similar sounds. It's like trying to follow a conversation when there's a lot of noise around. They might even miss cues in someone's voice, like sarcasm or jokes. \n\nNow, how do you know if someone's got CAPD? Well, you gotta watch how they listen and do some tests. It's kind of like a detective trying to solve a mystery. They'll ask questions, play sounds, and see how the person reacts.

She switches her affections from Viola to Sebastian real quick, like it's nothin'.  She even starts seein' Viola as family, not a lover.  So maybe it ain't so much about hidden feelings, but more about pointin' out how folks can be shallow.",
            "Alman, y'all know how the Germans were real meanies back in the day, especially to them folks in South West Africa. They went and did some real messed up stuff there, like wiping out whole groups of people. But you gotta remember, not every part of the German empire was like that. Some places were good, some were bad, just like everywhere else. \n\nNow, when it came to schoolin' folks, it was the same way. Some places, like East Africa, the Germans built schools and taught the local folks to read and write.  People back then even said how great the Germans were doin' with education in places like Kamerun. \n\nBut down in South West Africa, things were different. They didn't have much interest in teachin' the local people. Mostly, it was left up to the churches to do that, and they didn't get much help from the government. The Germans, though, they were all about schoolin' their own folks. They built schools for them and helped the churches run their schools too.\n\nThis messed things up for South West Africa for a long time, even after the Germans left. While other places had lots of folks who could read and write, in South West Africa, most people couldn't even read a lick. \n\nThere are lots of books written about how the Germans ran their colonies, mostly back when they were still in charge.  Some folks even compared how things worked in different places, like East Africa and South West Africa. They found that the Germans treated folks differently in each place, and that's what this paper wants to talk about.",
            "Listen,  music's changed a whole bunch in the last hundred years. There's so many dang types now, like rock, country, rap, jazz, and even folk.  And each of those has got a bunch of little types too, like little pups in a litter. Heavy metal's one of those that really went wild, man. It's like a big ol' family reunion, but instead of cousins, you got  sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, all rippin' and roarin'. \n\nIt's got all these different emotions, mostly the dark ones, like anger, sadness, and a whole lotta angst. But it's also really good at showin' off how talented these musicians are. \n\nIt's hard to say what metal even is anymore, 'cause it's borrowed from so many other things. But we gotta go back to the start, y'know? To see where this whole thing came from. Metal ain't just some genre, it's a whole movement, like a wildfire sweepin' through the music world. \n\nMetal's all about bein' loud, man. More bass, more volume, more everything! It's raw, it's real, and it's not afraid to get dark. Back in the 70s, folks were takin' a lot of drugs, and that messed with their heads in a good way. They started makin' music that sounded like it came from another planet. It was heavy, it was weird, and it was different.  \n\nMetal's got this darkness to it, somethin' that wasn't really around much in popular music before. Like, even the Beatles got in on it - that song \"Helter Skelter\" is pretty darn dark. It was like they were tryin' to prove they could be just as heavy as the Rolling Stones.  That's the heart of metal, man. It's about bein' raw, bein' real, and not shyin' away from the darkness.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya 'bout this fella, Henri Rousseau. Before them fancy Surrealists got all weird with their paintin', this guy was dreamin' up his own kinda dreams, you know?  He was a Post-Impressionist, real good, did a picture called \"The Dream\" way back in 1910. It ain't just some lady lookin' at pretty stuff in her sleep, it's Rousseau pourin' his heart and soul into it. He wanted everyone to like his art, ya know, the critics, the fancy folks. But he was stuck in a pickle.  Should he paint like everyone else to get ahead, or just be himself and hope for the best? That's what this \"Dream\" picture is all about, his big ol' struggle. \n\nNow, this Rousseau fella, he wasn't born with a silver spoon, that's for sure.  Grew up in France, his daddy sold stuff, but nothing fancy.  Never went to art school, worked for the government collectin' tolls, even got called a customs inspector though he wasn't. Lost his wife and kids, poor fella, so he picked up a paintbrush to escape his troubles. He wanted to paint like the common folk, tell their stories, ya know?  But the art world was tough, full of fancy artists who knew all the tricks.  He was older than most, and trying to catch up.\n\nHe wanted to be one of the big shots, just like Matisse, another famous painter, but they were different. Matisse was all about bein' unique,  Rousseau just wanted to fit in, paint what everyone expected and get accepted.",
            "Dang, folks, ya know how some smart guys say bein' good and lookin' pretty is like twins?  I reckon they're right.  Like that fella Keats said, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - That's all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" We learn a lot from schoolin' and livin', but knowin' right from wrong and what's beautiful, well, that just kinda hits ya. \n\nSee, we ain't taught how to appreciate art or good deeds, we just know it when we see it.  It's like tryin' to explain what makes a good song - you can talk about the chords and rhythm, but that ain't the whole story.  It's somethin' more, somethin' you feel deep down.\n\nNow, take that fancy Mona Lisa everyone's always goin' on about. You can talk about the paintin' all day long, but it's that somethin' else, that je ne sais quoi, that makes it tick. \n\nFigured that's how it is with good things, whether it's art or bein' a decent human. There's more to it than just the words or actions, there's somethin' deeper, somethin' that moves ya.\n\nThat's why art and morals are so darn close, 'cause they both touch us in that special way, deep down inside. You can't explain it, but you sure feel it.\n\nAnd when it comes to stories, well, that's somethin' else entirely.  Stories are like lookin' into the soul, they tell ya things you can't say out loud.",
            "Germany today is a strong country with a unique culture all its own. You can feel it everywhere, from the mountains of München to the city of Kiel by the Baltic Sea. Whether you're in Köln on the Rhine River, in the heart of the country, or in Dresden on the Elbe, the German culture is unmistakable.\n\nIt shouldn't surprise us that Germany, as we know it today, came from many different tribes and groups.  \n\n\"Germania\" is the old name for the land where the Germans came from.  \n\nScholars and historians still debate where the name \"German\" came from.  Some say it comes from a group called the Tungrians, who fought the Gauls a long time ago.  Others say Julius Caesar used the word \"Germanus\" to describe the tribes he fought across the Rhine River. He was trying to tell the difference between the Gauls, who he had conquered, and the Germans, who he hadn't. Some people think \"German\" came from a word the Gauls used to describe their neighbors.  Caesar himself wrote about the Germans in his writings about the Gallic Wars, saying they were constantly fighting with the Gauls.\n\nThere are other ideas too. Some think it comes from the spear they used in battle, called a \"ger.\" Others think it comes from an old Irish word meaning \"to shout,\" because the Germans were known for being loud. \n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote a book about the Germans called \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" and in it, he said he thought the Germans were the original people of the land and hadn't mixed with other races. He thought people wouldn't have chosen to move to Germany, with its wild land and harsh weather, unless it was their home. \n\nThe Romans did send troops to Germania for goods and to fight, but they didn't want to live there. \n\nThe Germanic tribes began appearing near the Roman Empire in the first century. They lived on the borders and traded goods and even served in the Roman army.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya, I was lookin' at this here mess, and my brain just wasn't catchin' on.  I was starin' at it, but it was like my mind was on vacation, ya know?  Just takin' it all in, but not really gettin' nothin' outta it.  Thoughts were poppin' in and out faster than a jackrabbit, never stickin' around long enough to make any sense.  It was like watchin' a movie on fast forward, seein' all the action but missin' the story.\n\nOnce, this artist buddy of mine, he told me to check out this book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\"  I always wanted to learn how to draw, ever since I was a little whippersnapper, and this book was supposed to teach ya everything, from how to hold a pencil right to how your brain sees lines and stuff.  One trick they teach is to put a square around whatever ya want to draw, like a frame, and that way, even if somethin's super complicated, ya can just focus on the basics.\n\nWell, lookin' at this thing in front of me, I couldn't picture that frame, couldn't break it down like that.  I was just floored, man, overwhelmed.  Like, Picasso had his blue phase, Monet loved them green things, and all them fancy Renaissance painters, they used every color under the sun.  If I was gonna call myself an artist, this here was my start, my own masterpiece, \"Work in Brown.\"  \n\nSo I picked up my tool of the trade, ya know, got my hand all ready, and I'm thinkin' this is gonna be the most creative moment of my life.  The water was swirlin' around, nice and smooth, clear as day.  Little bits of stuff were breakin' off, floatin' away.  But then, my hand gets all tense, shakin' a little, and BAM!  I slam the toilet handle again.  That brown package wouldn't budge, stuck like glue to the bottom.\n\nI got my mop, standin' there with my tie feelin' like it was chokin' me, just starin' at this thing someone left behind.  A message for the poor saps who clean bathrooms at Rite Aid, I guess.  Flushed a couple more times, tried to get my mind back in the game, but then I just reached for the toilet paper, wrapped myself up like a goddamn mummy.  Standing up straight, bendin' over, I reach into the bowl, like a mama bird checkin' on her nest…",
            "Now listen up, folks. Those young whippersnappers, they're gettin' killed behind the wheel somethin' fierce! Why? Well, their brains ain't fully cooked yet, ya know? It's like tryin' to run a marathon with a cold. They got no experience, nothin' but a learner's permit and a whole lotta bravado. \n\nI'm tellin' ya, those kids, they're like a bunch of chickens runnin' around a henhouse. They can't handle the pressure, especially when they got their buddies in the car.  Got a study done in California, shows the more passengers, the more accidents. Makes sense, right? \n\nThey tryin' to fix things with these temporary licenses, but it's like puttin' a bandaid on a broken leg. We gotta go deeper, see? These kids, they crave that thrill, that rush. Like, they ain't even 18 yet and they're thinkin' they're invincible. This psychologist, Zuckerman, he says even 18 is too young.  \n\nListen, we gotta wait 'til they grow up a bit, ya know? Let 'em have their fun, but not behind the wheel. By the time the baby boomers' kids are old enough to drive, we'll be lookin' at a real mess. \n\nWe need to make a law, a real law, not just some flimsy rule. Let 'em learn in school, but no drivin' 'til they're older. Maybe 19 or 20, when they've calmed down a little. Then, they can get their driver's permit, take some lessons, and show they're ready. \n\nIt ain't rocket science. We gotta protect these kids. This ain't no joke.",
            "So I was lookin' at all these old Edison movies, the Library of Congress has a bunch of 'em. I figured I'd check out the trick films, you know, the ones that play with your eyes.  There were fifteen of 'em, made between 1895 and 1901.  Mostly they just use cuttin' and pastin' together to make things look spooky or funny.  I kinda wanted to figure out how they did it, ya know, the tricks of the trade.\n\nMost of these old trick films stick to the same kinda thing. They're filmed in a little stage-like set, with the camera just sittin' there, not movin' around. Like they're watchin' a play or somethin'.  They don't use any fancy camera tricks, just long shots where you can see the whole thing at once.  And they never get real close up on nothin'.   It's like they're tryin' to show you the whole picture, like you're in the front row of a theater.\n\nNow, there are a few films, later on, that get a little wild and start usin' more than one shot.  But for the most part, they stick to this one-shot, one-movie deal.  So these films aren't real long, maybe a minute or two, just enough time for a quick trick or gag.  It's like a vaudeville act, y'know, quick and flashy.\n\nBut even though they only use one shot, sometimes they'll splice together a bunch of 'em to make it look like somethin' is apparin' or disappearin'.  Take that old film about Mary, Queen of Scots, for example. Looks like one shot, but if you really pay attention, you can see where they cut it together.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya 'bout this fella, John Taylor. He was a real firecracker when it came to this whole Republican thing, especially back in the day. You could tell he was a farmer, rough around the edges, but he knew his stuff.  This guy believed in freedom, plain and simple.  He thought the government shouldn't stick its nose in folks' business, especially when it came to how they made a livin'.  \n\nSee, John, he thought the United States had a real chance to do things right, build something special.  He figured we didn't have all that old-world baggage to hold us back, so we could make a system that worked for the people.  He was all about folks having the right to do their own thing, and he thought the government should stay outta the way.  \n\nNow, this John, he believed in this whole \"good and bad\" thing, like everybody's got a little bit of both in 'em.  He thought the government needed to keep an eye on that bad stuff, make sure it didn't get outta control. But, he didn't want the government to be too powerful, ya know? He wanted to keep it small and simple, just like he liked his farm.  \n\nJohn was a stickler for the Constitution, too.  He thought the government should only do what the Constitution said it could, and no more.  He didn't want some big, fancy government runnin' things, spendin' all our money and tellin' us what to do.  He thought the Founding Fathers had it right, and that's how we should keep it.",
            "Listen, we had this thing goin' on, tryin' to get folks to use less cars and walk or bike more. Figured it'd be a hoot, right? But lemme tell ya, it was a real struggle.  We saw these numbers droppin' fast around December, like folks just forgot all about it. Makes sense, I guess. Winter's comin' on, folks are busy with school and Christmas, and then everyone's gone on break. Even I get lazy when it's cold and snowy! We tried to get folks back on track with a \"Carpool Challenge\" in March, and that helped a bit. But it's tough, you know? People just love their cars. It's kinda like what I said about my pool, doin' it yourself is cheaper, but it takes a lot more work.  Give folks a free hybrid car, now that's somethin' that might get them movin'! We gave out gift cards and stuff, but maybe we shoulda gone bigger, ya know?  We coulda had a raffle, a big ol' prize draw! Might've kept folks more interested.",
            "You know how there's these things called ETFs, like investment clubs but fancier? They're supposed to be like a basket of stocks all rolled into one, kinda like a shortcut to owning a bunch of stuff at once. \n\nYou get the good parts of owning a bunch of different stocks, but with less fuss.  It's cheaper than some other ways of investing, but you still gotta pay a little somethin' somethin' every time you buy or sell. \n\nThe trick is, sometimes the \"shortcut\" ain't always the best shortcut.  Like, if you buy this ETF,  IHF, it's got a bunch of different stocks inside it, ten of 'em make up most of the deal.  So, I'm thinkin', maybe it's smarter to just buy those ten stocks straight up instead of through the ETF.  \n\nWe gotta figure out if buying the whole ETF is really better than buyin' those top ten stocks yourself.  It might sound complicated, but we're gonna look at how much money each stock in the ETF makes, and how risky it is. \n\nWe'll see if buying the whole ETF is really worth it, or if you'd be better off picking the top ten stocks yourself.",
            "So, this Poe fella, he wrote this poem called \"Dream-Land\", and he thinks it's pretty darn good.  In it, he uses this word \"Thulé\" a couple of times, and some smart guy named Mabbott says Poe probably got it from this old dude Virgil. Virgil wrote about an island called Thulé way up north, like beyond the edge of the world back then. Now, Virgil did use the word, but I bet Poe got it from a German writer named Goethe too.\n\nSee, Poe loved reading German stuff. And this Goethe guy, he wrote a famous play called \"Faust\",  about this guy who makes a deal with the devil.  There's this little poem inside \"Faust\" called \"The King of Thulé\", and it's about a king who loses his wife and goes totally bonkers. He drinks a whole lot, cries his eyes out, and finally decides to end it all. Kinda sounds like Poe's character in \"Dream-Land\",  don't it?  Maybe Poe was just channeling his own heartache through that poem.\n\nNow, this \"Faust\" thing was also made into a play around the time Poe was writing \"Dream-Land\".  So there's that connection too.  Poe used \"Thulé\" two times in his other writings, and he booksends \"Dream-Land\" with it. It's almost like he's putting those poems together, like puzzle pieces. In \"Dream-Land\", the speaker talks about this dark, lonely place, haunted by dead friends, kinda like that king in \"The King of Thulé\" after he loses his wife.\n\nSo, you gotta remember, Goethe was a big deal back then, and Poe knew his work. Even if it was just because Poe liked this other guy, Tennyson, who also liked Goethe.  Poe probably saw a lot of Goethe's stuff floating around.",
            "So there's this lady, Jennifer Palmer, who fell in a grocery store 'cause some applesauce was spilled.  She's sayin' the manager, this guy Martin, knew about the spill 'cause his employees told him about it twice, but he just ignored it 'cause he was eatin' dinner.  Palmer got hurt pretty bad, and now she wants the store to pay her some extra money called \"punitive damages\" 'cause she says Martin acted mean and reckless. \n\nNow, the judge ain't gonna just throw out her case right away.  To get those extra damages, Palmer gotta prove Martin knew his actions could hurt someone - like, he knew it was dangerous to leave that applesauce there.  She can say that Martin shoulda known 'cause people had been slipping and falling in the store all year.   \n\nWhether or not Martin was bein' straight up mean is a bit harder to prove. But, if six folks already fell and he still didn't clean up, it ain't lookin' good for him. \n\nIt all went down back in '09. A worker named Rich told Martin about the spill, but Martin said he didn't have time 'cause he was eatin'.  Another worker, Mary, told him again, and Martin said the same thing. Then, an hour later, Palmer went and slipped and hurt her back. \n\nNow, Palmer's sayin' she wants money for her hurt and for Martin bein' a real jerk. California law kinda says if someone acts mean or reckless, they can pay extra damages.  It ain't easy to prove, but Palmer thinks she can show that Martin knew what he was doin' was wrong.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya somethin'. Back when I took that Islam class at CBC, almost four years ago, we were always talkin' about whether Islam was a bad religion or not.  Seems like that question's even more important now than it was back then. You see, since 9/11, the news folks went from thinkin' Islam was the devil to thinkin' it was all sunshine and roses.  I bet you wouldn't have seen a guy like Barack Obama, with his Muslim family, runnin' for president back in 2001.\n\nNow, this book about Muhammad, well, it's somethin' else. See, back in the day, I thought Muhammad was a real tough guy, conquerin' tribes and makin' 'em turn Muslim or else. But this book, it paints him like some kinda martyr, misunderstood and humble.  Folks came to him all on their own, seein' the light, like they were drawn to him.\n\nAnd wouldn't ya know it, there's some similarities between how Muhammad did things and what Jesus did. Like that time he turned some mutton and milk into enough for forty guys?  Sounds like somethin' Jesus woulda done, don't it?  It makes me think they're tryin' to make Muhammad look like some kinda holy man, like he didn't need to prove nothin'.  It's kinda sneaky, ya know, makin' him seem like he's stealin' Jesus' thunder.\n\nPlus, they got all these stories about folks convertin' on their own, like they were just seein' the truth.  But a lot of these stories are second-hand, like they heard it from someone who heard it from someone else.  That makes it all kinda fishy to me.  It's like they're tryin' to make it sound more official, but it just makes me wonder.\n\nWhat really ticks me off is how they try to make Muhammad out to be this gentle, wise, and kinda lovable guy. But history tells a different story.  Was Muhammad really that nice?  I wonder if Muslims today even know the real story about how he came to power.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya somethin'.  Ever since Jesus hung up his sandals, folks been puttin' their own spin on what he taught.  Like, it's gone way off track, ya know?  The world's gettin' all fancy and progressive, but those stuck in their ways, they ain't gonna like it.  But those folks ain't gonna be the ones callin' the shots.  \n\nMark my words, folks are gonna start lookin' back, tryin' to figure out what Jesus really meant, ya know, cuttin' through all the fluff that's been piled on over the years.  It might take a while, maybe decades, maybe even longer, but it's gonna happen.  We're gonna see Christianity go back to its roots, like we're rewindin' a tape.  It's gonna be a whole lotta \"unlearnin'\" goin' on.\n\nAnd this ain't just some hippie dream.  The churches will still be there, leadin' the way, but things are gonna be different.  Folks are gonna start thinkin' alike more, like a big ol' family reunion.  Forget all this different denominations and whatnot,  we're all gonna be singin' from the same hymn book.\n\nHistory's full of these kinda turnarounds, ya know?  Just like the Romans used to hate Christians, then turned around and became Christians themselves.  And look at us, used to have slaves, now we got black folks runnin' the show.  This time, it's gonna be the churches, goin' back to basics, forgettin' all the extra stuff.\n\nNow, this ain't gonna happen overnight. It'll take some doin',  especially with all those folks who take everythin' about the Bible literally.  But we gotta understand what Jesus was really tryin' to say.\n\nSee, way back when, before Jesus came along, there was Judaism.  They believed in one God, and they had their holy books, just like Christians do now.  Back then, they weren't all on the same page though, had all sorts of different groups, just like today.",
            "Listen, folks, this whole \"The Jungle\" thing, it just shows how greedy folks can be. They only care about themselves and makin' a buck, ain't nothin' else that matters.  See, those factory owners, they're all about gettin' bigger and richer, don't give a hoot about the folks workin' for 'em or the mess they're makin'.  Sinclair, he paints a picture of this smoke-filled town, all dirty and nasty, and the bosses, they don't care a lick. They just keep pumpin' out the goods, makin' money, and forgettin' about the people and the planet. \n\nIt's the same with the workers. These bosses, they treat 'em like dirt. They work 'em to the bone, don't pay 'em right, and when they ain't needin' 'em no more, they just toss 'em out on the street.  Back then, there weren't no rules to protect folks, so these factory bosses could do whatever they wanted.\n\nIt's like sayin' these workers were slaves, only they weren't chained up. They had no say in nothin', nothin' but to do as they were told. This whole system, it's just plain wrong. It ain't right to treat people like that.",
            "This here writer guy, he's got a way of makin' ya feel somethin' about what he's talkin' about. Some ways work better than others, ya know?  Like that F. Scott fella, he wrote this book called \"The Great Gatsby\" and he uses all sorts of tricks to get ya feelin' a certain way. Sometimes he'll put words together that don't usually go together, just to make somethin' feel a certain way. Other times, he'll pick an object, like a color, and give it a special meaning, then use that meaning later on to make ya think about somethin' else. This fella, he really liked to use colors, like gold, green, white, gray, and red and pink. In his book \"The Great Gatsby,\" he's got all these special meanings for these colors, especially white and gray and red and pink. Then, he uses those meanings later on to give ya a certain feelin' about important stuff in the story.\n\nSee, he makes white and gray mean kinda like sameness, like everything's the same. White is a bit fancier, more high-class, and gray is more like old and worn out. He starts showin' ya this right at the beginning of the book, with lots of white and gray. Daisy and Jordan, they're always wearin' white, like, all the time. Everyone's wearin' white: Nick's in \"white flannels\" at Gatsby's party, Tom wears a \"white shirt\" when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine's all \"powdered milky white.\" The only time folks aren't wearin' white is when Nick's gettin' his first look at Gatsby's party, and everything's all \"gaudy with primary colors.\" He keeps usin' these colors for everyday stuff too, like when Nick goes to work, he goes down \"the white chasms of lower New York.\"  People's names at Gatsby's party are all \"gray names\" on Nick's list. Catherine's apartment is just one slice in a big \"white cake\" of buildings—it's all the same. He even calls plain people and places white or gray, like Jordan and Daisy had a \"white girlhood\" together, and there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the Valley of Ashes. Even the \"Italian child\" on the railroad is \"gray,\" and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man.\"\n\nAfter he's used white and gray enough, he starts usin' them to show that somethin' ain't that important, or that it's all the same. He does this with Daisy, for instance. After a long time without seein' much white or gray, he writes about Daisy bein' \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster.\" Now, Daisy starts feelin' less like a real person and more like somethin' Gatsby just wants, somethin' that's kinda uniform. He keeps usin' white and gray around Daisy to make ya feel that way. Like, there's a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar,\" and she's wearin' white again before Tom and Gatsby have that big fight.",
            "Well, down in San Diego, the weather's so nice and sunny, they grow all sorts of good stuff. Tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, peppers - you name it! Seems like everyone's going crazy for organic food down there, with folks waitin' forever to get their hands on it. Organic eggs and milk are real popular too. And get this, a lot of those organic farms let you come visit, take a hike, go birdwatching - kinda like a mini-vacation.\n\nYou know, it'd be a good deal for the landowner, makin' money but also helpin' out the environment. They could get some help from the government for makin' things better for the wildlife, while they teach folks about farms and sell some organic goodies. \n\n Now, growin' organic ain't all sunshine and roses, though. It takes a lot more work to keep those bugs and weeds away without chemicals, and sometimes you lose more crops. But on the bright side, it makes things better for all the plants and animals around. They're sayin' you can have more bees and butterflies and all sorts of critters when you don't use all those nasty chemicals.\n\nSo, this landowner's got a real opportunity. They've got this 160-acre piece of land near Potrero, California, with chaparral, grassland, and oak trees. It's right next to the Cleveland National Forest, which is full of all sorts of critters, some of 'em endangered, like the kangaroo rat and the mountain yellow-legged frog. This land's been used for farms and ranches for ages, so it's got a history too.\n\nSeems like this landowner's lookin' for ways to make money while keepin' things natural. They're lookin' into government programs to help them out and seein' what other organic farms in the area are doin'. It's a tough job, but it sounds like they're up for the challenge!",
            "Listen, culture, it's a real big deal when you're tryin' to talk business, ya know? It ain't just some one-size-fits-all thing, like sayin' all folks from one place are the same.  It's more like, understandin' how people from different places tick, what makes 'em tick. You can't just go in there thinkin' everyone's gonna play by the same rules, 'cause they ain't. If you're from Texas and talkin' to folks from, say, New York, well, you gotta remember you're speakin' different languages, kinda.  It ain't just the words, but the whole way you think about things, what's important, what you consider right or wrong.\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' you gotta be best buddies with everyone, but a little respect goes a long way. Learnin' about their customs, their history, even their prejudices, it all helps. Don't go in there tryin' to change 'em, just try to understand 'em. Especially if you're the one who needs somethin' from 'em.  If you're in their neck of the woods, show 'em you respect their way of doin' things.\n\nAnd listen, culture ain't just about countries, it's about companies too. Some companies are all about workin' hard, long hours, others are more laid back.  Pay attention to how they dress, how they talk, who they hire.  It all tells you somethin' about their culture.  Even in America, different companies are different.  You gotta figure out who you're dealin' with and play their game.\n\nBut the most important thing is understandin' their values, what they believe in. If they value savin' face or keepin' things peaceful, you ain't gonna wanna embarrass them in a negotiation. If they're all about gettin' the best deal, you gotta be ready to play tough.\n\nSo, before you sit down at the table, do your homework. Learn about your opponent, their culture, their values. It'll make all the difference in the world.",
            "Well now, these two fellas, Anselm and Aquinas, both want to prove there's a God, right?  They both think there's a God, just like that fella in the Bible said, \"The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’\"   See, they both agree on this God thing, so we gotta figure out who's got the better argument. Now, I'm gonna be honest, neither one of 'em really convinces me completely. \n\nAnselm, he figures God's already in our heads, y'know? Like, we gotta know He's there 'cause we can think about Him.  It's like, if you can think about somethin', it's gotta exist, right?  That's kinda how he sees it. Kinda like how you know your momma's always gonna nag you, even if you ain't see her in a while. You just know she's there, even if she ain't. Anselm's sayin' God's like that.\n\nNow, Aquinas, he's a different kind of bird. He's all about logic and facts, y'know, like a good businessman. He says we can prove God exists by lookin' at the world around us, seein' how things work and figuring out there gotta be a big guy behind it all. He's got five different reasons, all based on somethin' he calls \"logical necessity.\" Like, if you got a puzzle with a bunch of pieces, and you know there's one missin', you can figure out what that piece looks like just by lookin' at the rest, right? Aquinas is sayin' it's the same with God. We can see how things work, and we know He's gotta be there.",
            "Listen up, folks! Way back in the day, a long time ago, this dude was born.  He grew up to be a prince, but he wasn't your typical prince. See, this guy, who everyone calls Buddha, decided to ditch all the fancy stuff and figure out life.  He got really smart, you know, enlightened, and started teaching folks how to be better people. That's how Buddhism started, and the most hardcore version of it is called Theravada.  \n\nThis religion's been around for like 2,500 years, and it's changed a bit since Buddha was alive.  Like, in Sri Lanka, these monks and regular folks have this water-cutting ceremony every year. Buddha never talked about that, but it's a big deal for them. That's just one example, see?  From the little stuff to the big ideas, things have shifted over time.\n\nThe monks and the regular folks who follow Buddhism have had to tweak their beliefs a little.  Sometimes it's because of outside stuff, sometimes it's because of stuff inside the religion itself. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad, like a two-sided coin.\n\nNow, let me break down some words we'll be using a lot. We got \"inside\" and \"outside\" forces. Inside comes from people who are already Buddhists, whether they're monks or not. Outside comes from people who aren't Buddhists. We also got \"hostile\" and \"benign.\" Hostile means something bad, something that wants to hurt Buddhism. Benign means it doesn't care about hurting or helping, but it might end up doing one or the other by accident.\n\nFirst things first, let's talk about what Buddhists believe. They find peace in the \"triple gem\" – Buddha himself, his teachings (the Dhamma), and the community of Buddhists (the Sangha). The Dhamma is like a big library of Buddhist texts, divided into three parts.  There's the Sutta Pitaka, which is like the main stories. Then there's the Vinaya Pitaka, which has all the rules for monks and nuns. And finally, there's the Abhidhamma Pitaka, which gets all philosophical and talks about things like \"no self,\" \"suffering,\" and \"everything changes.\"  \n\nThe Buddhists say that understanding these things is the key to stopping the cycle of death and rebirth (that's called Sansara).  By letting go of greed, anger, and delusion, you can become enlightened and free from suffering.\n\nThey also have these rules called the \"five precepts\" for regular folks. They're basically: don't kill, don't lie, don't steal, don't cheat, and don't get drunk. Monks and nuns have way more rules, of course.\n\nThe most important idea in Buddhism is the \"four noble truths.\"  First, life is full of suffering. Second, we suffer because we cling to things. Third, we can stop suffering. And fourth, there's a way to stop suffering. It's all about understanding these truths and living your life accordingly.",
            "Listen up, folks!  America and Mexico, they had a right ol' grudge match goin' on for a good long while, near 'bout 57 years, from back in 1836 all the way to 1893.  These two were like cats and dogs, always at each other's throats.  The biggest blow up was that Mexican-American War back in the 1840s.  America went in there, kicked some Mexican tail, and took Texas and all that fancy Southwest land for itself.  And they weren't just brawlin' over land, neither.  They butted heads 'bout religion, culture, and all sorts of other stuff.  It's like when your neighbor is always stealin' your lawn ornaments and talkin' smack about your grillin' skills.\n\nYou see this kinda rivalry pop up all the time between neighbors.  They're right there, sniffin' each other out, always lookin' for a reason to squabble.  America and Mexico, they're like that.  Some folks say America's always got problems with Mexico and Cuba, more'n any other country down south.  Maybe it's 'cause they're so close, always rubbin' elbows.\n\nReligion, that's another thing that got 'em riled up.  Back in the day, America didn't much like Catholicism.  Sound familiar?  It's like the Cold War, but instead of communism, it was religion.  You had Americans and Mexicans, both holdin' onto their beliefs tight, like a dog with a bone. \n\nThey went at it somethin' fierce, these two.  Border skirmishes, bandits runnin' amok, it was a mess.  But eventually, things cooled down.  Mexico got real reliant on America for stuff, and America's focus shifted from takin' land to makin' money.   They found a way to get along, after all that ruckus.",
            "Fifteen years ago, somethin' hit me outta nowhere, like a ton of bricks. I got this sickness, one I never even knew existed. Back then I was a nurse, ya know? I'd always figured that'd be my gig - everyone's gotta get sick sometime, right?  Always thought I'd be a scientist or a writer, maybe both, but I went with the safe bet. \"Nursing's a sure thing,\" folks kept sayin', \"you'll always have work.\" So, here I was, 46, single, and nothin' in the bank, suddenly unable to work. This illness, it messed me up good.  Fifteen years on disability, and I'm down to nothin'.  Barely gettin' by, every day's a fight, like I'm right back in that insecure childhood.  Life ain't solid anymore, not one bit. But there's one thing I know for sure: I couldn't have made it this far without my family and a few good friends.  Trust me, when life throws ya a curveball, you don't feel so tough.\n\nSee, life throws you curveballs, big and small. You can plan all ya want, but some things, you just can't handle alone.  \n\nFolks on the right, they talk about \"rugged individualism,\" how that built this country. But back in the day, it wasn't just grit that got 'em through. It was lookin' out for each other, sharin' what you had. Those pioneers who crossed the Rockies, they didn't make it by go'in it alone. They stuck together.\n\n\nSo, yeah, be prepared.  I am. I got a disaster kit, first aid, water purifier, even plastic sheeting for the windows if somethin' nasty ever happens. Flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, canned goods – the whole shebang.  If you got the land, grow your own food, learn to can it. Good idea, especially if you got a wood stove.  But here's the thing, don't forget about your neighbors. Get to know 'em.",
            "Alright, so ya see these fancy scientists, they're tryin' to figure out how critters change over time, right?  It's like, why do they look the way they do?  Is there some kinda rulebook for how evolution works?  Back in 1917, this fella D'Arcy Thompson said we're barely scratchin' the surface of understandin' how to talk about this stuff with numbers.  And ya know what?  He's still right!\n\nBut now, folks are usin' math to try and figure out how shells on these squirmy sea critters called mollusks grow.  It's like, take a picture of the shell at different stages, then use a computer program to see what might happen if it grew in different ways.  Kinda like buildin' a model, ya know?  They're callin' it \"mathematical modeling,\" which sounds fancy, but it's just tryin' to make sense of how things change.\n\nImagine a shell like a snail's house, but instead of brick, it's made of this hard stuff.  It spirals around and around, like a ramp windin' up.  Each turn is called a whorl, and the center is called the columella.  Some shells grow faster in some parts than others, and you can see the lines where the whorls join up.  The biggest part is the last one, called the body whorl.\n\nNow, picture a whole bunch of these shells, like a family history of snails.  Scientists look at how they're all different, how they grew, and try to figure out what made them change.  They're usin' math to help 'em see the patterns and make predictions.  It's like a big puzzle, but instead of pieces, it's shells!",
            "Listen, Indonesia's been doin' alright for the last ten years, y'know? They're gettin' closer to meetin' those fancy Millennium Development Goals, like makin' sure folks have clean water and bathrooms. But when it comes to takin' care of babies and moms, they're fallin' behind.  We gotta do better, ya hear? \n\nNow, they're braggin' about more folks havin' babies with a healthcare worker around. But lemme tell ya, a lot of 'em are just midwives, not real doctors. So what good is that when somethin' goes wrong?  And the thing about kids gettin' sick with the trots, well, they're not seein' doctors much anymore. It's sad, really. And don't even get me started on how they're treatin' moms after they give birth. Ain't right.\n\nC-sections are too low, especially in the sticks. It's like they're forgettin' folks out there in the country.  Those folks in the cities, they got it good. But the poor? They ain't got a chance. They can't afford healthcare, you see?\n\nSo what do we do? Should we just throw money at specific problems, or should we fix the whole darn healthcare system? \n\nProgrammatic stuff sounds good, like targetin' just newborn care. It's easier to manage and you see results faster. But here's the rub: if you focus too much on one thing, you forget about everything else. And everyone wants to work on the hot topic, so the rest gets neglected.  It's like a tug-of-war, ya know?",
            "Victorian books are all about the little details and they really love to talk about fancy rich people. But there are a couple of books from that time, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, that don't really follow those rules. They've got this mystery going on and some weird stuff happens, which is different from most books back then.  This mystery stuff helps us understand the characters better, like what they're really thinking and feeling.  \n\nHere's a little bit from Oliver Twist that shows what I mean:\n\n“'He felt like he was stuck between Sikes and Crackit, who were arguing and yelling.  He could even hear them talking, even though he wasn't really there. Then suddenly, he heard a gunshot, and everything around him exploded into chaos. Lights were flashing, people were screaming, and someone grabbed him and started dragging him away.  Through it all, he felt this awful, nagging pain that wouldn't go away.” (Dickens, 220)\n\nThese books use mystery and strange stuff, like dreams, to show you what's going on inside the characters' heads.  In Oliver Twist, these weird dreams tell us about Oliver's pain and how confused he is about what's happening around him. When Oliver gets shot, he has a dream about it again in Chapter 28, and it's like he's reliving the whole thing.  It shows how much pain he's in and how helpless he feels.  He can't even see who's dragging him away because he's so overwhelmed.  Oliver doesn't feel in control of anything, and it makes you wonder if someone is making bad things happen to him on purpose. This shooting shows how much control Oliver has lost.  He doesn't even try to fight back, like maybe someone has broken his spirit and made him give up.\n\n\n“Time just flew by.  One minute it was day, the next it was night again. Night felt long and scary because it was so quiet, but it also felt short because it went by so quickly.”",
            "So, lemme tell ya 'bout this kid, Adrian. Couple years back, I was workin' at this after-school thing, helpin' out little kids with their schoolwork. Now, I was pretty good with English and readin', but this kid Adrian, he was givin' me fits.  He was in third or fourth grade, somethin' like that.  Seemed like he understood some words fine, but others, he'd butcher 'em somethin' fierce. It was like he were speakin' a different language, but he talked perfect English! I was scratchin' my head, wonderin' what was goin' on.  He was Latino,  that much I knew, but his English was spot on. We went round and round, but nothin' seemed to click. Then one day, Adrian's mama came to pick him up. Now, she didn't speak a lick of English, only Spanish.  I was just learnin' a few words myself, but we managed to get by.  That's when it hit me like a ton of bricks – the kid could read fine, he just didn't know his ABCs!  Maybe it wasn't so much a problem with readin', but more like a language problem, you know? I dunno if it helped him much in the long run, but I sure hope he's doin' alright now.\n\nThis whole thing got me thinkin' 'bout how tough it can be for kids who don't speak English well.  We gotta do somethin' about it, right here in California, where there are so many different languages.  It ain't always as clear-cut as you think. Even if a kid speaks English good, readin' it can still be a real pain. \n\nSo, what's the answer? Well, Adrian's case was kinda simple – he just needed help with learnin' the alphabet and how to pronounce the letters. But for kids who barely speak English, it's a whole different ball game. There ain't just one magic bullet. We gotta try different things,  like dual language programs,  where kids learn in both English and their own language.  We gotta have more ESL classes, and maybe even some private tutors. It takes a whole lotta effort, but we gotta do it. \n\nFirst things first, let's talk about these dual language programs. They're great for all kids, not just those who speak Spanish. Lots of folks are scared of 'em, thinkin' they waste money and don't help most kids. But that's just plain wrong. If we used these programs more often, every kid would benefit.\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' every teacher has to be bilingual. That'd be crazy! But we could have special helpers, tutors, whatever ya call 'em, who speak both languages. That'd make a big difference, I tell ya!",
            "Well, lemme tell ya, from the time we're little whippersnappers, folks are always talkin' 'bout somethin' bigger than us, somethin' we can't even wrap our heads around. Some go to church, some go to temple, some just try to figure it out on their own.  Lotta folks just go with what their parents taught 'em, but some folks, they say \"Nah, ain't nothin' out there but what we can see right here.\"  Might change their minds later, but that's life, ain't it?  We all lookin' for somethin', somethin' to make sense of it all, a light in the darkness, you know what I mean?\n\nMy old man, he was a simple fella. One time, I asked him what his favorite bird was and he said a cardinal.  We were sittin' on the porch, rain beatin' down like a drum, smokin' cigarettes.  He looked out at the rain, kinda lost in thought, like he was seein' somethin' only he could see.  He'd gotten real thin, clothes hangin' off him like a sack of potatoes.  His hair was thin too, lettin' the light shine through.  He wouldn't look at me, kept his eyes on the rain.  I felt kinda lost, scared even, 'cause I didn't know how to tell him I was gonna miss him somethin' fierce. Sayin' it out loud would make it real, and that was somethin' neither of us wanted. So I just wrapped my arms around him, sat back down, scooted my chair closer, and joined him in starin' at the rain.\n\nThat was June. My dad passed away in December, just five days after my 22nd birthday. The chemo and radiation, it didn't stop the pain, just dragged it on a little longer. Doctors said he wouldn't make it past a certain point, but he hung on.  I couldn't figure out what good it did, just made things harder.  I thought, \"What kinda God lets this happen?\"  In the dead of night, I didn't even pray.  If there was a God out there, I figured he'd stopped listenin' a long time ago.\n\nI didn't wanna watch him go, so I didn't.  Couldn't stand to see the life that gave me life slip away.  I wanted to remember him for the good times, not the last days.  Besides, I knew him better than anyone else, better than his own family.  I knew he wouldn't want me there, watchin' him die.  So I curled up in bed for three days, waitin' for the news.",
            "Alright, so this \"Gothic Novel\" thing, it's kinda like a mix-up, y'know?  Like, it's old and new at the same time. This writer, Ian Watt, he called it an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New'\".  Some folks say Gothic stories ain't got no depth, while others think they're somethin' special, like they make ya feel somethin' real deep down. \n\nThis first Gothic story, \"The Castle of Otranto\" by Horace Walpole, it took bits and pieces from old stories and new ones to make somethin' brand new.  Walpole, he used stuff from old plays and then mixed it up with how folks were writin' stories back then, and called it a \"Gothic Story\".  He liked usin' stuff from the days of castles and knights, even though back then, folks thought all that was just old hat. They were all about bein' \"modern\" and fancy.\n\nBut here's the thing - Gothic stories got this mix of old and new that made 'em stick around for a long time. They're like a time capsule, y'know?  You read 'em now, and they feel old, but they also feel kinda fresh, like somethin' new.\n\nOne of the big ideas in Gothic stories is this thing called \"Chivalry\". Back in the olden days, folks were all about knights and how they were supposed to be brave and good.  Walpole, he wrote \"The Castle of Otranto\" when things were kinda messed up politically, and he thought maybe folks weren't so chivalrous anymore. So, he wrote about these knights, like this guy Frederic, to show what a real knight should be like.",
            "Let me tell ya, this supply chain thing, it's like a big ol' recipe for gettin' stuff from point A to point B. You got your customer orderin' somethin', and then it's a whole chain reaction, ya know? Raw materials gotta get gathered, stuff gets made, then shipped out to the customer.  This fella, Keith Oliver, back in '82, he came up with the name \"Supply Chain Management.\"  He figured out it's all about plannin' this whole shebang, makin' sure it runs smooth, and gettin' what folks want, quick and easy.\n\nThere's six main parts to this whole thing, kinda like the ingredients in that recipe.  You got production, supply, inventory, where to put things, how to move 'em, and information - gotta keep track of it all!\n\nProduction's the first step, the foundation, like the flour in a cake.  You gotta figure out what folks want,  what they're buyin', like lookin' at the whole market, seein' what's hot.  Then, you decide what to make, how much, where to make it, and make sure the stuff comes out right, like bakin' that cake just right.  Got to be careful, 'cause if somethin's off, it can cost ya big time. Remember when I worked at Walmart and Target? They had all these rules, like a recipe book, for everything! Made sure things ran smooth, no confusion.\n\nThen you got supply, figuring out where you're gonna get your ingredients from.  You might have different parts of your business doin' different things, like makin' the cake batter and the frosting.  You gotta decide who does what best, maybe even gettin' help from other folks, like outsourcing the frosting.  That way, you can get it done faster, cheaper, and still make a darn good cake!",

Now, Burma, that's a rough place, ruled by a bunch of tough guys who took over back in '62. See, they don't like folks speakin' up, kinda like my old man when I was a kid. \n\nA few years back, some monks decided they'd had enough, so they started marchin', wearin' their yellow robes, and callin' it the \"Saffron Revolution.\"  It's like when I get mad about the price of beans, but instead of yellin', they're marchin' and stuff.\n\nWell, the government didn't like it much. They started crackin' down, hurtin' folks, even killin' a few.  They don't want anyone messin' with their power, just like those guys back in the day with big hats and fancy words, tryin' to tell everyone what to think.  \n\nThis ain't nothin' new, though. Seems like folks in power always wanna be in charge, no matter what. They act like they're gods, like that emperor in Rome or that fella in Japan who thought he was a phone company CEO. Even our own president, he hangs out with those guys who think they know everything.\n\nYou remember what happened in China, back in '89?  Students and folks like that, they got together, and the government, well, let's just say they didn't like it much. And then there was Rwanda, where they went after folks just 'cause they were different.\n\nListen, it all boils down to this: folks in power don't like it when you challenge 'em. They wanna be the boss, call all the shots.  It's like tryin' to tell my dog what to do, only a lot more serious.",
            "Now listen, this Duke Ellington fella, he was a real deal jazz cat. He stuck around for a long time, and that means he got real good at making his band sound good. He might not have played the piano loud in all his songs, but boy, could he write some fancy tunes!  He made music where each guy in the band could show off their skills, but he also knew how to get everyone playing together like a well-oiled machine. He could make the whole band sound like one big, amazing voice.  \n\nThis one book about music says Ellington was real good at using voices in jazz, like makin' 'em sound like instruments. He had this song called \"Creole Love Call\" where the voice ain't singin' words, it's just makin' sounds, like a real instrument.  He was all about givin' each musician a chance to shine, and this song shows that. It's slow and bluesy, and it goes through these different parts where different guys get to show off.  You got the voice talkin' back and forth with the wind instruments, then the trumpet plays a solo, all smooth and bluesy. Then the clarinet takes over, all high and fancy. It's like a conversation between all these different sounds. And then the whole band jumps in, makin' it all come together.\n\nHe did the same thing in other songs, too, like \"Hot and Bothered\" and \"It Don't Mean a Thing.\" He'd use a trumpet player and a singer, makin' their voices sound like instruments, and then he'd have a trombone player start a melody, makin' it all sound real special.  Duke Ellington, he knew how to make jazz sound good, and he did it for a long, long time.",
            "She'd always felt like somethin' was missin'. Like there was a hole inside her that nothin' could fill. This feelin' started when she was about fourteen, just gettin' into all that teenage stuff. And it was still there three years later, when she turned seventeen. By then, she'd figured out she wanted some kinda person in her life, not just some shiny thing. But she just couldn't find a boy who caught her eye. A few guys tried to court her, all awkward and clumsy, but none of 'em did nothin' for her. She spent a lot of time wonderin' why this was happenin' to her, tryin' to figure out what was makin' her so different from other girls her age. She had some ideas, but nothin' that really made sense. So she just kept livin' her life, always wonderin' about this empty space inside her.\n\nLife at home was usually pretty peaceful. Her folks were good, calm people. They never fought with each other, and rarely argued with her either. The only time they'd butt heads was when she tried to act more independent, showin' off her own spunky personality. She was the daughter of two mellow folks, but she sure brought the energy, always up for somethin' fun. Everyone liked her 'cause she was sweet and fun-lovin'.\n\nBut today wasn't a peaceful day. She was moseying from room to room, tryin' to find some inspiration, when she heard a little scream from the kitchen. It was her mom's voice, and she sounded scared.  She bolted into the kitchen, worryin' somethin' awful. \"Mom! Mom, what's wrong?\" She saw her mom on the floor, lookin' pale and in pain, whimperin', \"Ow,\" with every breath. She rushed to her mom's side and touched her gently. \"Ouch... sweety, I... need you to take me to... the hospital.\" She was speakin' in short bursts, and it was clear she was hurt bad. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where I need to pick you up.\" Her mom pointed, and her daughter, strong from all those self-defense classes, knew just what to do. She carried her mom to the car, set her down gently in the back seat, and drove like a bat outta hell.\n\nThe hospital smelled like antiseptic and sickness, but all she could think about was helpin' her mom. She rushed her inside, yellin' for a doctor. A bunch of worried faces gathered around, and someone quickly got a gurney and laid her mom down. They took her away for treatment, leavin' her daughter sittin' there, worry gnawin' at her insides.\n\nTurns out, her mom had fallen off a step stool while reachin' for a vase high up on a shelf.",
            "This here study's tryin' to show that eatin' like folks in the Mediterranean, you know, that \"Mediterranean Diet\" stuff, keeps your ticker tickin' good and helps you avoid strokes. They got this fancy name for it, \"alternate Mediterranean diet\" or somethin', but it's all about eatin' your veggies, fruits, nuts, and fish, and cuttin' back on the meat and greasy stuff. A little vino ain't gonna hurt neither.\n\nSee, folks have been sayin' for a while now that this Mediterranean eatin' helps keep you healthy, but nobody really focused on strokes before. This study followed a bunch of nurses for 20 years, ask'em what they ate every few years, and low and behold, the ones who ate the most Mediterranean, they had less heart problems and strokes. \n\nThey measured all sorts of things too, like how much they weighed, if they smoked, if they took vitamins, and if they were hoppin' around or sittin' on their duffs. Then they crunched the numbers and found that the more Mediterranean you ate, the less likely you were to have a heart attack or stroke. Pretty simple, really.",

Jobs disappeared faster than a shot of whiskey, the housing market crashed harder than a drunk at a rodeo, and all them big fancy companies were left lookin' like a dog that ate a whole watermelon.  This mess ain't gone away yet, so we gotta ask ourselves, what in tarnation happened and how do we fix it?\n\nSee, this whole financial crisis was like a bad case of the clap, caught by them politicians makin' decisions that were about as smart as a possum in a headlock. They pushed banks and folks to give out loans like candy at Halloween, even to folks who couldn't afford a bag of chips. And these fancy folks at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, they took these loans and bundled them up into these complicated things called CDO's and CDS'. When folks started missin' their payments, the banks were left holdin' the bag, and the whole dang economy went kablooey!\n\nThis whole mess started back in '99, when President Clinton was tryin' to get re-elected. He wanted folks to like him, so he loosened up the rules on givin' out loans. It was like lettin' a bunch of toddlers loose with a whole candy store, only instead of candy, it was loans. And just like a toddler with a candy store, it all ended in a sticky mess.\n\nThen they started creatin' these newfangled mortgages, like adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and these things called CDO's. They were all fancy words for makin' things even more complicated, and it was like tangled fishing line, just makin' the whole mess worse. Folks were borrowin' money they didn't have, and the housing market got all inflated like a hot air balloon.  \n\nAnd then, just like a balloon with a hole in it, the bubble burst. All them banks that bought these fancy mortgage packages were left holdin' the bag, and the whole country went into a tailspin.",
            "Alright, listen up, ya'll. This here's about exposition, that part of a story where you gotta show off your fancy writer's skills, or else your readers might just fall asleep faster'n a catfish in a mud puddle.  I'm talkin' 'bout the stuff that makes 'em wanna slam that \"Back\" button harder'n a slammed truck door.  Even ol' Dr. Merlin, she gets frustrated with Too Much Information. Not the fun kind, mind you, the kinda info that makes ya wanna scream, \"Get to the point, ya dang story!\"\n\nNow, you folks know the golden rule, \"Show, don't tell,\" right? But even I stumble sometimes, spillin' out pages and pages of nothin' happenin', or worse, too darn much happenin'. That's exposition, my friends. It's like that little devil whisperin' in your ear, tellin' ya to get all the backstory outta the way so you can get to the good stuff.  But hold your horses! Don't go tellin' your readers every darn thing about every character's childhood, got it?\n\nExposition is like that character in a movie who just lays it all out, spoutin' info like a broken record.  Or, in a story, it's the author doin' the talkin', layin' it all on thick.\n\nLet me give ya an example. Imagine a story where the heroine met her hubby in a fancy place, got hitched in a big ol' ceremony, and then BAM! He's murdered right in front of her. You wouldn't wanna read two pages of nothin' but tellin' about that, would ya?  You'd expect somethin' more, somethin' with heart.  Show me the husband's love for his wife through his words and actions. Show me how he changed her life.  Make me feel somethin'!\n\nDon't just tell me they met, got married, and he died. Give me the juicy details!  \n\nSee, that's what exposition is all about. You gotta give your readers somethin' to sink their teeth into. Don't be stingy with the details, folks!",
            "Man, I watched a couple of news things from Columbus, Ohio the other day. \n\nFirst up was NBC 4, live this mornin' (August 13th, 2011). They had this story 'bout a fella in Ashley, Ohio who stabbed his wife real bad. Didn't say her name, but the guy's name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot, and lemme tell ya, the dude looked like a snake in a Sunday suit! They only talked about it for, like, two minutes, sayin' he stabbed her a bunch of times and got hauled off. Seemed about right to me, givin' it a couple of minutes while they figured things out.\n\nNext, they talked about this Travis Buyers, 18 years old, got shot real bad in the Sharon Woods area. No one knew who did it, SWAT was on the case. I gotta say, they didn't spend much time on this one. You know why? I bet it's 'cause this fella was black, or maybe he lived in a black neighborhood. It's like the news forgets folks like that got problems too. If a white kid got hurt, they'd be all over it, but if it's a black person, they barely even mention it. \n\nThen they talked about a bullet hole in one of them Med-Flight helicopters. Said it was a .22 from a rifle. They were offerin' five grand for any tips that led to the jerk who shot it.\n\nThey threw in a quickie about the rain comin' this weekend, said it'd be in the eighties, yadda yadda. Just teasin' ya to keep watchin', I guess.\n\nThey also had this story about a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road. They said the robber was a dark-skinned black man, wearin' a hoodie, about six feet tall and 150 pounds. Seemed kinda weird to me how much they hammered on about him bein' black.\n\nAnd finally, they talked about this Rene Rodriguez, a drug dealer from Texas who got caught slingin' weed to Ohio. He got 300 months, which is 25 years, right?  They kept sayin' 300 months, like it was supposed to sound scarier.  And they mentioned he was Hispanic, but what does that have to do with anything?",
            "Brothers, man, they got this bond, you know? Like, it's unbreakable, like somethin' you can't explain. It's got all kinds of stuff in it, love, yeah, but also pride, jealousy, even mean stuff sometimes. You know, brothers, they get each other, more than anybody else. It's like lookin' in a mirror, seein' yourself but somehow different, you know? And when things get tough, that bond, it really shows its true colors, good or bad.  It ain't always pretty, but it's real.  This story, \"The Scarlet Ibis\", it's all about that, about these two brothers and all the crazy feelings they got for each other.\n\nThey're runnin' around this beautiful place, but they're on a trip that ain't gonna end well. There's this bitter disappointment, like, they're both tryin' so hard but it ain't workin' out. Then there's this pride, this big ol' mess of pride, and it all comes to a head. In the end, only one brother makes it out alive.  \n\nThe story tells you about these emotions through the main guy, Doodle, and how he acts.  And it also tells you about how he sees the world, which is important 'cause that shapes how he acts.  It's all tied together, see?\n\n\nThe main guy, he's all about that pride, from the start. He wants a brother who can keep up with him, you know, someone to do all these cool things with. But Doodle, he's weak, he can't do any of that.  The main guy, he gets mad, even thinks about smotherin' the little kid. Can you believe that? But then Doodle smiles at him, and bam! All the anger melts away.  See, deep down, he loves his brother.",
            "Ya know, the brain, it's a heck of a thing.  Folks used to say it was like a wax tablet, then a piece of paper, then a book. Now they say it's like a computer. But, lemme tell ya, those are just fancy words for somethin' complicated. \n\nSee, information comes in through your senses - touch, sound, sight, all that jazz. Your brain takes that stuff and messes with it, like a recipe.  First, it breaks it down, little by little, like lookin' at a box.  Then, it puts it all back together, faster than you can say \"jack rabbit.\"  It's like, if you see a box, your brain says, \"Hey, that's a box!\"  But it's not just seein' the box, it's knowin' it's a box, not a hole.\n\nNow, your brain ain't just a sponge soakin' up everything. It's got a filter, like a bouncer at a club.  It says, \"Hey, this is important, pay attention!\" and \"Nah, this ain't worth your time.\"  Like, you see a bunch of grass, but you don't notice each blade. But if your name gets called out in a crowd, boom, you hear it! \n\nThe brain also got this memory thing goin' on. It stores stuff, like a big ol' warehouse.  It's got different rooms for different kinds of stuff - short-term, long-term, all that.  And it remembers by makin' connections, like a spider web.  So when you remember somethin', it's like followin' a thread through the web.",
            "Alright, so this Huxley fella, he's givin' us the lowdown on how technology and big ol' corporations are gonna mess us all up someday. He writes this book, \"Brave New World,\" and it's a real downer.  Everyone in this world is all about being part of the crowd and gettin' their instant gratification fix.  They don't care about bein' individuals, 'cause the big boss man, the World Controller, tells 'em what to think and do. \n\nHuxley's kinda like a Marxist, see? He sees how these rich folks are usin' this system to keep the rest of us dumb and happy, just workin' and spendin' all the time. He calls it \"false consciousness.\"  It's like they're puttin' a blindfold on us so we don't see how the real world works.  We're all just pawns in their game, chasin' after the next shiny thing, and they're siphonin' off all the dough.\n\nThese folks in the book, they got these different classes, like the Deltas, Gammas, and all that.  They're all conditioned from birth to be happy with their lot in life,  even if it means they're bein' used.  They don't even know they're bein' used!\n\nAnd the worst part is, the people at the top, the Alphas and Betas, they know what's goin' on, but they don't care. They just keep on enjoyin' their fancy lives, leavin' the rest of us to rot.\n\nHuxley even shows how this system crushes real human connection. Nobody in this world has any real feelings, no deep thoughts, nothin'.  They're just talkin' about how good lookin' the chicks are or how many times they slept with 'em. It's all just surface stuff.  \n\nIt's like Huxley's sayin', if we keep lettin' technology and big corporations run our lives, we're gonna lose our humanity. We'll become nothin' more than robots, followin' orders and spendin' all our time on empty pleasures.",
            "Been at this University Park place for a couple years now, almost three.  Gotta say, getting around this campus is a real pain in the neck. Back when I was livin' in  East Halls, which is like, way outta the way,  getting to classes down near Willard building felt like a cross-country trek. Sometimes, especially when the weather was crappier than a week-old burger, it took me a good 25 minutes just to walk there. Talked to an old-timer who graduated not too long ago, and he told me how they used to have all this empty space between East Halls and the rest of campus. Now, they've crammed in all these new buildings, sports fields, and apartments. With all the changes, it's getting harder and harder to get around.  What's the solution? Bikes, man!  \n\nHad a buddy tell me the other day how he'd gotten back into ridin' bikes. Said it was the only way to get around, and he was glad he'd started again.  You know, bikes are good for ya, plus they're the fastest way to get from here to there. You can ride a bike with just some oatmeal in your belly and cover 30 miles without breaking a sweat. I live off campus now, just as far from the center of campus as some of those dorms.  Best thing I did this year was buy myself a bike.  \n\nMy classes are in Thomas building, which is a good 25-minute walk from my place. But on my bike? Five minutes, tops!  The only problem is  Pollock Road ain't always the safest route. It's a straight shot, but there are times when it's a real pain to ride.  Walkin' ain't bad, but I ain't got the time. If I didn't have my bike, I'd be walkin'  to Thomas every day, which would be a good 30-40 minutes each way. That's over two and a half hours a week just walkin' to class! Add to that all the other places I gotta go, and it'd be a real time suck."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "Well, lemme tell ya, I'm gonna be a social worker, helpin' out them poor kids who got mistreated, ya know? And I'll be workin' with families who are havin' a hard time.  I reckon I got a few things to offer this social work gig, like bein' helpful, treatin' folks right, doin' things the right way, and tryin' to make things better between people. And I'm talkin' 'bout makin' myself better too, so I can do my job real good.\n\nTruth be told, I always wanted to help folks out, but I wasn't sure how.  In high school and college, I saw folks runnin' from their problems, avoidin' 'em like the plague. Some tried to cope, but not real good, if ya catch my drift. I even got a degree in psychology from Piedmont College back in '09, just tryin' to figure things out.\n\nThen one summer, I met this sixteen-year-old kid, nervous as a cat in a room full of rocking chairs. My friend told me he was runnin' from his abusive parents. The next day, I found out he called the cops on 'em. So, I figured I'd see what I could do, so I went over to their house. I talked to the cops, told 'em I was a psychology grad from Piedmont. They asked me to talk to the parents 'cause there wasn't much they could do for the kid. When I questioned 'em, they were all jumpy and makin' excuses about their son bein' manipulative for gettin' the cops involved. That's when I knew, I gotta be a social worker, helpin' kids caught in these family messes.\n\nAnother thing that's important to me is social justice.  We say we value each person, but sometimes it feels like we just want everyone to be the same. I'm me, and I ain't afraid to be different.  Back in school, I protested against injustice whenever I could.  Colored my hair crazy colors, wore what I wanted, pierced my ears, joined that GSBA group, stood up against racism and discrimination. I believe in social justice, and I'll keep fightin' for it.",
            "Alright, so this here paper's gonna talk about two ways of lookin' at insomnia - the \"sciencey\" way and the \"people and their surroundings\" way.\n\nThe sciencey way, they call it the biological model, focuses on stuff like your genes and your overall health. It's all about how your body's wired to sleep and what happens when things go wrong. \n\nThen there's the \"people and their surroundings\" way, which is called the sociocultural model. This one looks at how your environment, your family, your neighborhood, and even your job can affect your sleep. \n\nThis paper's gonna go through both these models and talk about some studies that tried to figure out how they work.  We'll also talk about the good and bad parts of each study, ya know, like what they got right and where they might have missed the mark.\n\nNow, sleep problems can come in all shapes and sizes. Sometimes they're just about sleep itself - like trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. Other times, they're connected to other stuff going on in your head, like stress or anxiety. And sometimes they're caused by medical conditions or things you're taking.\n\nThe paper's gonna focus mainly on insomnia, which is that trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. It'll also touch on other sleep problems that are similar.\n\nOne study looked at something called the GABAB receptor. Turns out, this little fella in your brain is important for sleep.  They did some experiments on mice, and found that messing with this receptor can mess with their sleep.  It's kinda like a light switch for sleep. \n\nSo what does this mean for us humans? Well, it means that our genes might play a role in how well we sleep. And if something's wrong with that GABAB receptor, it could make it harder to get a good night's rest.",

Think of it like this: you can hear perfectly fine, but your brain's like, \"Huh? What was that?\" \n\nNow, back in the day, folks called it \"auditory imperception,\" like it was some kinda secret code. But these smart folks started figuring out that it wasn't just kids not paying attention, it was their brains messing up the sound signals. They started doing tests to see how people's brains handled sounds, like trying to tell apart two words said at the same time. \n\nSo, what happens when someone's got CAPD? Well, they might have a hard time telling where a sound is coming from, or they might mix up similar sounds. It's like trying to follow a conversation when there's a lot of noise around. They might even miss cues in someone's voice, like sarcasm or jokes. \n\nNow, how do you know if someone's got CAPD? Well, you gotta watch how they listen and do some tests. It's kind of like a detective trying to solve a mystery. They'll ask questions, play sounds, and see how the person reacts. There ain't no magic bullet test, but they'll look for patterns and clues.",
            "So this play, Twelfth Night, it's sayin' somethin' about pretendin'. See, it can work for a while, keepin' up a fake face, but eventually, you gotta drop the act.  Otherwise, you might just lose yourself, ya know? The problem is, when you do let the truth out, things can get messy.  Folks might get mad, feel betrayed. It's a tough choice, like pickin' between yourself and your friends. Some folks might not care if you've been tellin' fibs, but others, well, they get their feelings hurt easy.\n\nNow, this whole pretendin' thing gets even trickier when it comes to switchin' up your gender. Why'd ya wanna pretend to be someone you ain't? \n\nTake Viola, for example. She's gotta put on a guy's clothes to stay safe in a foreign land.  It's a way to protect herself, see? But guess what? It pushes her away from other women, the folks she coulda relied on.  And then things get even weirder when Olivia, this woman, falls head over heels for her, thinkin' she's a dude!  And don't forget, Viola's got feelings for Orsino, but she can't let on, 'cause she's playin' the part.  It's a tangled web!\n\nThis play, it kinda shows how fakin' it can bring out hidden stuff, like feelings you ain't even aware of.  Maybe Olivia's drawn to Viola 'cause she's disguised as a man, or maybe, just maybe, Olivia's got some feelings for women she's keepin' under wraps.  \n\nBut here's the thing, this Olivia, she's probably just makin' fun of folks who judge others by their looks.  She switches her affections from Viola to Sebastian real quick, like it's nothin'.  She even starts seein' Viola as family, not a lover.  So maybe it ain't so much about hidden feelings, but more about pointin' out how folks can be shallow.",
            "Alman, y'all know how the Germans were real meanies back in the day, especially to them folks in South West Africa. They went and did some real messed up stuff there, like wiping out whole groups of people. But you gotta remember, not every part of the German empire was like that. Some places were good, some were bad, just like everywhere else. \n\nNow, when it came to schoolin' folks, it was the same way. Some places, like East Africa, the Germans built schools and taught the local folks to read and write.  People back then even said how great the Germans were doin' with education in places like Kamerun. \n\nBut down in South West Africa, things were different. They didn't have much interest in teachin' the local people. Mostly, it was left up to the churches to do that, and they didn't get much help from the government. The Germans, though, they were all about schoolin' their own folks. They built schools for them and helped the churches run their schools too.\n\nThis messed things up for South West Africa for a long time, even after the Germans left. While other places had lots of folks who could read and write, in South West Africa, most people couldn't even read a lick. \n\nThere are lots of books written about how the Germans ran their colonies, mostly back when they were still in charge.  Some folks even compared how things worked in different places, like East Africa and South West Africa. They found that the Germans treated folks differently in each place, and that's what this paper wants to talk about.",
            "Listen,  music's changed a whole bunch in the last hundred years. There's so many dang types now, like rock, country, rap, jazz, and even folk.  And each of those has got a bunch of little types too, like little pups in a litter. Heavy metal's one of those that really went wild, man. It's like a big ol' family reunion, but instead of cousins, you got  sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, all rippin' and roarin'. \n\nIt's got all these different emotions, mostly the dark ones, like anger, sadness, and a whole lotta angst. But it's also really good at showin' off how talented these musicians are. \n\nIt's hard to say what metal even is anymore, 'cause it's borrowed from so many other things. But we gotta go back to the start, y'know? To see where this whole thing came from. Metal ain't just some genre, it's a whole movement, like a wildfire sweepin' through the music world. \n\nMetal's all about bein' loud, man. More bass, more volume, more everything! It's raw, it's real, and it's not afraid to get dark. Back in the 70s, folks were takin' a lot of drugs, and that messed with their heads in a good way. They started makin' music that sounded like it came from another planet. It was heavy, it was weird, and it was different.  \n\nMetal's got this darkness to it, somethin' that wasn't really around much in popular music before. Like, even the Beatles got in on it - that song \"Helter Skelter\" is pretty darn dark. It was like they were tryin' to prove they could be just as heavy as the Rolling Stones.

            "Well, lemme tell ya 'bout this fella, Henri Rousseau. Before them fancy Surrealists got all weird with their paintin', this guy was dreamin' up his own kinda dreams, you know?  He was a Post-Impressionist, real good, did a picture called \"The Dream\" way back in 1910. It ain't just some lady lookin' at pretty stuff in her sleep, it's Rousseau pourin' his heart and soul into it. He wanted everyone to like his art, ya know, the critics, the fancy folks. But he was stuck in a pickle.  Should he paint like everyone else to get ahead, or just be himself and hope for the best? That's what this \"Dream\" picture is all about, his big ol' struggle. \n\nNow, this Rousseau fella, he wasn't born with a silver spoon, that's for sure.  Grew up in France, his daddy sold stuff, but nothing fancy.  Never went to art school, worked for the government collectin' tolls, even got called a customs inspector though he wasn't. Lost his wife and kids, poor fella, so he picked up a paintbrush to escape his troubles. He wanted to paint like the common folk, tell their stories, ya know?  But the art world was tough, full of fancy artists who knew all the tricks.  He was older than most, and trying to catch up.\n\nHe wanted to be one of the big shots, just like Matisse, another famous painter, but they were different. Matisse was all about bein' unique,  Rousseau just wanted to fit in, paint what everyone expected and get accepted.",

It's like tryin' to explain what makes a good song - you can talk about the chords and rhythm, but that ain't the whole story.  It's somethin' more, somethin' you feel deep down.\n\nNow, take that fancy Mona Lisa everyone's always goin' on about. You can talk about the paintin' all day long, but it's that somethin' else, that je ne sais quoi, that makes it tick. \n\nFigured that's how it is with good things, whether it's art or bein' a decent human. There's more to it than just the words or actions, there's somethin' deeper, somethin' that moves ya.\n\nThat's why art and morals are so darn close, 'cause they both touch us in that special way, deep down inside. You can't explain it, but you sure feel it.\n\nAnd when it comes to stories, well, that's somethin' else entirely.

            "Germany today is a strong country with a unique culture all its own. You can feel it everywhere, from the mountains of München to the city of Kiel by the Baltic Sea. Whether you're in Köln on the Rhine River, in the heart of the country, or in Dresden on the Elbe, the German culture is unmistakable.\n\nIt shouldn't surprise us that Germany, as we know it today, came from many different tribes and groups.  \n\n\"Germania\" is the old name for the land where the Germans came from.  \n\nScholars and historians still debate where the name \"German\" came from.  Some say it comes from a group called the Tungrians, who fought the Gauls a long time ago.  Others say Julius Caesar used the word \"Germanus\" to describe the tribes he fought across the Rhine River. He was trying to tell the difference between the Gauls, who he had conquered, and the Germans, who he hadn't. Some people think \"German\" came from a word the Gauls used to describe their neighbors.  Caesar himself wrote about the Germans in his writings about the Gallic Wars, saying they were constantly fighting with the Gauls.\n\nThere are other ideas too. Some think it comes from the spear they used in battle, called a \"ger.\" Others think it comes from an old Irish word meaning \"to shout,\" because the Germans were known for being loud. \n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote a book about the Germans called \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" and in it, he said he thought the Germans were the original people of the land and hadn't mixed with other races. He thought people wouldn't have chosen to move to Germany, with its wild land and harsh weather, unless it was their home. \n\nThe Romans did send troops to Germania for goods and to fight, but they didn't want to live there. \n\nThe Germanic tribes began appearing near the Roman Empire in the first century. They lived on the borders and traded goods and even served in the Roman army.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya, I was lookin' at this here mess, and my brain just wasn't catchin' on.  I was starin' at it, but it was like my mind was on vacation, ya know?  Just takin' it all in, but not really gettin' nothin' outta it.  Thoughts were poppin' in and out faster than a jackrabbit, never stickin' around long enough to make any sense.  It was like watchin' a movie on fast forward, seein' all the action but missin' the story.\n\nOnce, this artist buddy of mine, he told me to check out this book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\"  I always wanted to learn how to draw, ever since I was a little whippersnapper, and this book was supposed to teach ya everything, from how to hold a pencil right to how your brain sees lines and stuff.  One trick they teach is to put a square around whatever ya want to draw, like a frame, and that way, even if somethin's super complicated, ya can just focus on the basics.\n\nWell, lookin' at this thing in front of me, I couldn't picture that frame, couldn't break it down like that.  I was just floored, man, overwhelmed.  Like, Picasso had his blue phase, Monet loved them green things, and all them fancy Renaissance painters, they used every color under the sun.  If I was gonna call myself an artist, this here was my start, my own masterpiece, \"Work in Brown.\"  \n\nSo I picked up my tool of the trade, ya know, got my hand all ready, and I'm thinkin' this is gonna be the most creative moment of my life.  The water was swirlin' around, nice and smooth, clear as day.  Little bits of stuff were breakin' off, floatin' away.  But then, my hand gets all tense, shakin' a little, and BAM!  I slam the toilet handle again.  That brown package wouldn't budge, stuck like glue to the bottom.\n\nI got my mop, standin' there with my tie feelin' like it was chokin' me, just starin' at this thing someone left behind.  A message for the poor saps who clean bathrooms at Rite Aid, I guess.  Flushed a couple more times, tried to get my mind back in the game, but then I just reached for the toilet paper, wrapped myself up like a goddamn mummy.  Standing up straight, bendin' over, I reach into the bowl, like a mama bird checkin' on her nest…",
            "Now listen up, folks. Those young whippersnappers, they're gettin' killed behind the wheel somethin' fierce! Why? Well, their brains ain't fully cooked yet, ya know? It's like tryin' to run a marathon with a cold. They got no experience, nothin' but a learner's permit and a whole lotta bravado. \n\nI'm tellin' ya, those kids, they're like a bunch of chickens runnin' around a henhouse. They can't handle the pressure, especially when they got their buddies in the car.  Got a study done in California, shows the more passengers, the more accidents. Makes sense, right? \n\nThey tryin' to fix things with these temporary licenses, but it's like puttin' a bandaid on a broken leg. We gotta go deeper, see? These kids, they crave that thrill, that rush. Like, they ain't even 18 yet and they're thinkin' they're invincible. This psychologist, Zuckerman, he says even 18 is too young.  \n\nListen, we gotta wait 'til they grow up a bit, ya know? Let 'em have their fun, but not behind the wheel. By the time the baby boomers' kids are old enough to drive, we'll be lookin' at a real mess. \n\nWe need to make a law, a real law, not just some flimsy rule. Let 'em learn in school, but no drivin' 'til they're older. Maybe 19 or 20, when they've calmed down a little. Then, they can get their driver's permit, take some lessons, and show they're ready. \n\nIt ain't rocket science. We gotta protect these kids. This ain't no joke.",
            "So I was lookin' at all these old Edison movies, the Library of Congress has a bunch of 'em. I figured I'd check out the trick films, you know, the ones that play with your eyes.  There were fifteen of 'em, made between 1895 and 1901.  Mostly they just use cuttin' and pastin' together to make things look spooky or funny.  I kinda wanted to figure out how they did it, ya know, the tricks of the trade.\n\nMost of these old trick films stick to the same kinda thing. They're filmed in a little stage-like set, with the camera just sittin' there, not movin' around. Like they're watchin' a play or somethin'.  They don't use any fancy camera tricks, just long shots where you can see the whole thing at once.  And they never get real close up on nothin'.   It's like they're tryin' to show you the whole picture, like you're in the front row of a theater.\n\nNow, there are a few films, later on, that get a little wild and start usin' more than one shot.  But for the most part, they stick to this one-shot, one-movie deal.  So these films aren't real long, maybe a minute or two, just enough time for a quick trick or gag.  It's like a vaudeville act, y'know, quick and flashy.\n\nBut even though they only use one shot, sometimes they'll splice together a bunch of 'em to make it look like somethin' is apparin' or disappearin'.  Take that old film about Mary, Queen of Scots, for example. Looks like one shot, but if you really pay attention, you can see where they cut it together.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya 'bout this fella, John Taylor. He was a real firecracker when it came to this whole Republican thing, especially back in the day. You could tell he was a farmer, rough around the edges, but he knew his stuff.  This guy believed in freedom, plain and simple.  He thought the government shouldn't stick its nose in folks' business, especially when it came to how they made a livin'.  \n\nSee, John, he thought the United States had a real chance to do things right, build something special.  He figured we didn't have all that old-world baggage to hold us back, so we could make a system that worked for the people.  He was all about folks having the right to do their own thing, and he thought the government should stay outta the way.  \n\nNow, this John, he believed in this whole \"good and bad\" thing, like everybody's got a little bit of both in 'em.  He thought the government needed to keep an eye on that bad stuff, make sure it didn't get outta control. But, he didn't want the government to be too powerful, ya know? He wanted to keep it small and simple, just like he liked his farm.  \n\nJohn was a stickler for the Constitution, too.  He thought the government should only do what the Constitution said it could, and no more.  He didn't want some big, fancy government runnin' things, spendin' all our money and tellin' us what to do.  He thought the Founding Fathers had it right, and that's how we should keep it.",
            "Listen, we had this thing goin' on, tryin' to get folks to use less cars and walk or bike more. Figured it'd be a hoot, right? But lemme tell ya, it was a real struggle.  We saw these numbers droppin' fast around December, like folks just forgot all about it. Makes sense, I guess. Winter's comin' on, folks are busy with school and Christmas, and then everyone's gone on break. Even I get lazy when it's cold and snowy! We tried to get folks back on track with a \"Carpool Challenge\" in March, and that helped a bit. But it's tough, you know? People just love their cars. It's kinda like what I said about my pool, doin' it yourself is cheaper, but it takes a lot more work.  Give folks a free hybrid car, now that's somethin' that might get them movin'! We gave out gift cards and stuff, but maybe we shoulda gone bigger, ya know?  We coulda had a raffle, a big ol' prize draw! Might've kept folks more interested.",
            "You know how there's these things called ETFs, like investment clubs but fancier? They're supposed to be like a basket of stocks all rolled into one, kinda like a shortcut to owning a bunch of stuff at once. \n\nYou get the good parts of owning a bunch of different stocks, but with less fuss.  It's cheaper than some other ways of investing, but you still gotta pay a little somethin' somethin' every time you buy or sell. \n\nThe trick is, sometimes the \"shortcut\" ain't always the best shortcut.  Like, if you buy this ETF,  IHF, it's got a bunch of different stocks inside it, ten of 'em make up most of the deal.  So, I'm thinkin', maybe it's smarter to just buy those ten stocks straight up instead of through the ETF.  \n\nWe gotta figure out if buying the whole ETF is really better than buyin' those top ten stocks yourself.  It might sound complicated, but we're gonna look at how much money each stock in the ETF makes, and how risky it is. \n\nWe'll see if buying the whole ETF is really worth it, or if you'd be better off picking the top ten stocks yourself.",
            "So, this Poe fella, he wrote this poem called \"Dream-Land\", and he thinks it's pretty darn good.  In it, he uses this word \"Thulé\" a couple of times, and some smart guy named Mabbott says Poe probably got it from this old dude Virgil. Virgil wrote about an island called Thulé way up north, like beyond the edge of the world back then. Now, Virgil did use the word, but I bet Poe got it from a German writer named Goethe too.\n\nSee, Poe loved reading German stuff. And this Goethe guy, he wrote a famous play called \"Faust\",  about this guy who makes a deal with the devil.  There's this little poem inside \"Faust\" called \"The King of Thulé\", and it's about a king who loses his wife and goes totally bonkers. He drinks a whole lot, cries his eyes out, and finally decides to end it all. Kinda sounds like Poe's character in \"Dream-Land\",  don't it?  Maybe Poe was just channeling his own heartache through that poem.\n\nNow, this \"Faust\" thing was also made into a play around the time Poe was writing \"Dream-Land\".  So there's that connection too.  Poe used \"Thulé\" two times in his other writings, and he booksends \"Dream-Land\" with it. It's almost like he's putting those poems together, like puzzle pieces. In \"Dream-Land\", the speaker talks about this dark, lonely place, haunted by dead friends, kinda like that king in \"The King of Thulé\" after he loses his wife.\n\nSo, you gotta remember, Goethe was a big deal back then, and Poe knew his work. Even if it was just because Poe liked this other guy, Tennyson, who also liked Goethe.  Poe probably saw a lot of Goethe's stuff floating around.",
            "So there's this lady, Jennifer Palmer, who fell in a grocery store 'cause some applesauce was spilled.  She's sayin' the manager, this guy Martin, knew about the spill 'cause his employees told him about it twice, but he just ignored it 'cause he was eatin' dinner.  Palmer got hurt pretty bad, and now she wants the store to pay her some extra money called \"punitive damages\" 'cause she says Martin acted mean and reckless. \n\nNow, the judge ain't gonna just throw out her case right away.  To get those extra damages, Palmer gotta prove Martin knew his actions could hurt someone - like, he knew it was dangerous to leave that applesauce there.  She can say that Martin shoulda known 'cause people had been slipping and falling in the store all year.   \n\nWhether or not Martin was bein' straight up mean is a bit harder to prove. But, if six folks already fell and he still didn't clean up, it ain't lookin' good for him. \n\nIt all went down back in '09. A worker named Rich told Martin about the spill, but Martin said he didn't have time 'cause he was eatin'.  Another worker, Mary, told him again, and Martin said the same thing. Then, an hour later, Palmer went and slipped and hurt her back. \n\nNow, Palmer's sayin' she wants money for her hurt and for Martin bein' a real jerk. California law kinda says if someone acts mean or reckless, they can pay extra damages.  It ain't easy to prove, but Palmer thinks she can show that Martin knew what he was doin' was wrong.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya somethin'. Back when I took that Islam class at CBC, almost four years ago, we were always talkin' about whether Islam was a bad religion or not.  Seems like that question's even more important now than it was back then. You see, since 9/11, the news folks went from thinkin' Islam was the devil to thinkin' it was all sunshine and roses.  I bet you wouldn't have seen a guy like Barack Obama, with his Muslim family, runnin' for president back in 2001.\n\nNow, this book about Muhammad, well, it's somethin' else. See, back in the day, I thought Muhammad was a real tough guy, conquerin' tribes and makin' 'em turn Muslim or else. But this book, it paints him like some kinda martyr, misunderstood and humble.  Folks came to him all on their own, seein' the light, like they were drawn to him.\n\nAnd wouldn't ya know it, there's some similarities between how Muhammad did things and what Jesus did. Like that time he turned some mutton and milk into enough for forty guys?  Sounds like somethin' Jesus woulda done, don't it?  It makes me think they're tryin' to make Muhammad look like some kinda holy man, like he didn't need to prove nothin'.  It's kinda sneaky, ya know, makin' him seem like he's stealin' Jesus' thunder.\n\nPlus, they got all these stories about folks convertin' on their own, like they were just seein' the truth.  But a lot of these stories are second-hand, like they heard it from someone who heard it from someone else.  That makes it all kinda fishy to me.  It's like they're tryin' to make it sound more official, but it just makes me wonder.\n\nWhat really ticks me off is how they try to make Muhammad out to be this gentle, wise, and kinda lovable guy. But history tells a different story.  Was Muhammad really that nice?  I wonder if Muslims today even know the real story about how he came to power.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya somethin'.  Ever since Jesus hung up his sandals, folks been puttin' their own spin on what he taught.  Like, it's gone way off track, ya know?  The world's gettin' all fancy and progressive, but those stuck in their ways, they ain't gonna like it.  But those folks ain't gonna be the ones callin' the shots.  \n\nMark my words, folks are gonna start lookin' back, tryin' to figure out what Jesus really meant, ya know, cuttin' through all the fluff that's been piled on over the years.  It might take a while, maybe decades, maybe even longer, but it's gonna happen.  We're gonna see Christianity go back to its roots, like we're rewindin' a tape.  It's gonna be a whole lotta \"unlearnin'\" goin' on.\n\nAnd this ain't just some hippie dream.  The churches will still be there, leadin' the way, but things are gonna be different.  Folks are gonna start thinkin' alike more, like a big ol' family reunion.  Forget all this different denominations and whatnot,  we're all gonna be singin' from the same hymn book.\n\nHistory's full of these kinda turnarounds, ya know?  Just like the Romans used to hate Christians, then turned around and became Christians themselves.  And look at us, used to have slaves, now we got black folks runnin' the show.  This time, it's gonna be the churches, goin' back to basics, forgettin' all the extra stuff.\n\nNow, this ain't gonna happen overnight. It'll take some doin',  especially with all those folks who take everythin' about the Bible literally.  But we gotta understand what Jesus was really tryin' to say.\n\nSee, way back when, before Jesus came along, there was Judaism.  They believed in one God, and they had their holy books, just like Christians do now.  Back then, they weren't all on the same page though, had all sorts of different groups, just like today.",
            "Listen, folks, this whole \"The Jungle\" thing, it just shows how greedy folks can be. They only care about themselves and makin' a buck, ain't nothin' else that matters.  See, those factory owners, they're all about gettin' bigger and richer, don't give a hoot about the folks workin' for 'em or the mess they're makin'.  Sinclair, he paints a picture of this smoke-filled town, all dirty and nasty, and the bosses, they don't care a lick. They just keep pumpin' out the goods, makin' money, and forgettin' about the people and the planet. \n\nIt's the same with the workers. These bosses, they treat 'em like dirt. They work 'em to the bone, don't pay 'em right, and when they ain't needin' 'em no more, they just toss 'em out on the street.  Back then, there weren't no rules to protect folks, so these factory bosses could do whatever they wanted.\n\nIt's like sayin' these workers were slaves, only they weren't chained up. They had no say in nothin', nothin' but to do as they were told. This whole system, it's just plain wrong. It ain't right to treat people like that.",
            "This here writer guy, he's got a way of makin' ya feel somethin' about what he's talkin' about. Some ways work better than others, ya know?  Like that F. Scott fella, he wrote this book called \"The Great Gatsby\" and he uses all sorts of tricks to get ya feelin' a certain way. Sometimes he'll put words together that don't usually go together, just to make somethin' feel a certain way. Other times, he'll pick an object, like a color, and give it a special meaning, then use that meaning later on to make ya think about somethin' else. This fella, he really liked to use colors, like gold, green, white, gray, and red and pink. In his book \"The Great Gatsby,\" he's got all these special meanings for these colors, especially white and gray and red and pink. Then, he uses those meanings later on to give ya a certain feelin' about important stuff in the story.\n\nSee, he makes white and gray mean kinda like sameness, like everything's the same. White is a bit fancier, more high-class, and gray is more like old and worn out. He starts showin' ya this right at the beginning of the book, with lots of white and gray. Daisy and Jordan, they're always wearin' white, like, all the time. Everyone's wearin' white: Nick's in \"white flannels\" at Gatsby's party, Tom wears a \"white shirt\" when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine's all \"powdered milky white.\" The only time folks aren't wearin' white is when Nick's gettin' his first look at Gatsby's party, and everything's all \"gaudy with primary colors.\" He keeps usin' these colors for everyday stuff too, like when Nick goes to work, he goes down \"the white chasms of lower New York.\"  People's names at Gatsby's party are all \"gray names\" on Nick's list. Catherine's apartment is just one slice in a big \"white cake\" of buildings—it's all the same. He even calls plain people and places white or gray, like Jordan and Daisy had a \"white girlhood\" together, and there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the Valley of Ashes. Even the \"Italian child\" on the railroad is \"gray,\" and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man.\"\n\nAfter he's used white and gray enough, he starts usin' them to show that somethin' ain't that important, or that it's all the same. He does this with Daisy, for instance. After a long time without seein' much white or gray, he writes about Daisy bein' \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster.\" Now, Daisy starts feelin' less like a real person and more like somethin' Gatsby just wants, somethin' that's kinda uniform. He keeps usin' white and gray around Daisy to make ya feel that way. Like, there's a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar,\" and she's wearin' white again before Tom and Gatsby have that big fight.",
            "Well, down in San Diego, the weather's so nice and sunny, they grow all sorts of good stuff. Tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, peppers - you name it! Seems like everyone's going crazy for organic food down there, with folks waitin' forever to get their hands on it. Organic eggs and milk are real popular too. And get this, a lot of those organic farms let you come visit, take a hike, go birdwatching - kinda like a mini-vacation.\n\nYou know, it'd be a good deal for the landowner, makin' money but also helpin' out the environment. They could get some help from the government for makin' things better for the wildlife, while they teach folks about farms and sell some organic goodies. \n\n Now, growin' organic ain't all sunshine and roses, though. It takes a lot more work to keep those bugs and weeds away without chemicals, and sometimes you lose more crops. But on the bright side, it makes things better for all the plants and animals around. They're sayin' you can have more bees and butterflies and all sorts of critters when you don't use all those nasty chemicals.\n\nSo, this landowner's got a real opportunity. They've got this 160-acre piece of land near Potrero, California, with chaparral, grassland, and oak trees. It's right next to the Cleveland National Forest, which is full of all sorts of critters, some of 'em endangered, like the kangaroo rat and the mountain yellow-legged frog. This land's been used for farms and ranches for ages, so it's got a history too.\n\nSeems like this landowner's lookin' for ways to make money while keepin' things natural. They're lookin' into government programs to help them out and seein' what other organic farms in the area are doin'. It's a tough job, but it sounds like they're up for the challenge!",
            "Listen, culture, it's a real big deal when you're tryin' to talk business, ya know? It ain't just some one-size-fits-all thing, like sayin' all folks from one place are the same.  It's more like, understandin' how people from different places tick, what makes 'em tick. You can't just go in there thinkin' everyone's gonna play by the same rules, 'cause they ain't. If you're from Texas and talkin' to folks from, say, New York, well, you gotta remember you're speakin' different languages, kinda.  It ain't just the words, but the whole way you think about things, what's important, what you consider right or wrong.\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' you gotta be best buddies with everyone, but a little respect goes a long way. Learnin' about their customs, their history, even their prejudices, it all helps. Don't go in there tryin' to change 'em, just try to understand 'em. Especially if you're the one who needs somethin' from 'em.  If you're in their neck of the woods, show 'em you respect their way of doin' things.\n\nAnd listen, culture ain't just about countries, it's about companies too. Some companies are all about workin' hard, long hours, others are more laid back.  Pay attention to how they dress, how they talk, who they hire.  It all tells you somethin' about their culture.  Even in America, different companies are different.  You gotta figure out who you're dealin' with and play their game.\n\nBut the most important thing is understandin' their values, what they believe in. If they value savin' face or keepin' things peaceful, you ain't gonna wanna embarrass them in a negotiation. If they're all about gettin' the best deal, you gotta be ready to play tough.\n\nSo, before you sit down at the table, do your homework. Learn about your opponent, their culture, their values. It'll make all the difference in the world.",
            "Well now, these two fellas, Anselm and Aquinas, both want to prove there's a God, right?  They both think there's a God, just like that fella in the Bible said, \"The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’\"   See, they both agree on this God thing, so we gotta figure out who's got the better argument. Now, I'm gonna be honest, neither one of 'em really convinces me completely. \n\nAnselm, he figures God's already in our heads, y'know? Like, we gotta know He's there 'cause we can think about Him.  It's like, if you can think about somethin', it's gotta exist, right?  That's kinda how he sees it. Kinda like how you know your momma's always gonna nag you, even if you ain't see her in a while. You just know she's there, even if she ain't. Anselm's sayin' God's like that.\n\nNow, Aquinas, he's a different kind of bird. He's all about logic and facts, y'know, like a good businessman. He says we can prove God exists by lookin' at the world around us, seein' how things work and figuring out there gotta be a big guy behind it all. He's got five different reasons, all based on somethin' he calls \"logical necessity.\" Like, if you got a puzzle with a bunch of pieces, and you know there's one missin', you can figure out what that piece looks like just by lookin' at the rest, right? Aquinas is sayin' it's the same with God. We can see how things work, and we know He's gotta be there.",
            "Listen up, folks! Way back in the day, a long time ago, this dude was born.  He grew up to be a prince, but he wasn't your typical prince. See, this guy, who everyone calls Buddha, decided to ditch all the fancy stuff and figure out life.  He got really smart, you know, enlightened, and started teaching folks how to be better people. That's how Buddhism started, and the most hardcore version of it is called Theravada.  \n\nThis religion's been around for like 2,500 years, and it's changed a bit since Buddha was alive.  Like, in Sri Lanka, these monks and regular folks have this water-cutting ceremony every year. Buddha never talked about that, but it's a big deal for them. That's just one example, see?  From the little stuff to the big ideas, things have shifted over time.\n\nThe monks and the regular folks who follow Buddhism have had to tweak their beliefs a little.  Sometimes it's because of outside stuff, sometimes it's because of stuff inside the religion itself. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad, like a two-sided coin.\n\nNow, let me break down some words we'll be using a lot. We got \"inside\" and \"outside\" forces. Inside comes from people who are already Buddhists, whether they're monks or not. Outside comes from people who aren't Buddhists. We also got \"hostile\" and \"benign.\" Hostile means something bad, something that wants to hurt Buddhism. Benign means it doesn't care about hurting or helping, but it might end up doing one or the other by accident.\n\nFirst things first, let's talk about what Buddhists believe. They find peace in the \"triple gem\" – Buddha himself, his teachings (the Dhamma), and the community of Buddhists (the Sangha). The Dhamma is like a big library of Buddhist texts, divided into three parts.  There's the Sutta Pitaka, which is like the main stories. Then there's the Vinaya Pitaka, which has all the rules for monks and nuns. And finally, there's the Abhidhamma Pitaka, which gets all philosophical and talks about things like \"no self,\" \"suffering,\" and \"everything changes.\"  \n\nThe Buddhists say that understanding these things is the key to stopping the cycle of death and rebirth (that's called Sansara).  By letting go of greed, anger, and delusion, you can become enlightened and free from suffering.\n\nThey also have these rules called the \"five precepts\" for regular folks. They're basically: don't kill, don't lie, don't steal, don't cheat, and don't get drunk. Monks and nuns have way more rules, of course.\n\nThe most important idea in Buddhism is the \"four noble truths.\"  First, life is full of suffering. Second, we suffer because we cling to things. Third, we can stop suffering. And fourth, there's a way to stop suffering. It's all about understanding these truths and living your life accordingly.",
            "Listen up, folks!  America and Mexico, they had a right ol' grudge match goin' on for a good long while, near 'bout 57 years, from back in 1836 all the way to 1893.  These two were like cats and dogs, always at each other's throats.  The biggest blow up was that Mexican-American War back in the 1840s.  America went in there, kicked some Mexican tail, and took Texas and all that fancy Southwest land for itself.  And they weren't just brawlin' over land, neither.  They butted heads 'bout religion, culture, and all sorts of other stuff.  It's like when your neighbor is always stealin' your lawn ornaments and talkin' smack about your grillin' skills.\n\nYou see this kinda rivalry pop up all the time between neighbors.  They're right there, sniffin' each other out, always lookin' for a reason to squabble.  America and Mexico, they're like that.  Some folks say America's always got problems with Mexico and Cuba, more'n any other country down south.  Maybe it's 'cause they're so close, always rubbin' elbows.\n\nReligion, that's another thing that got 'em riled up.  Back in the day, America didn't much like Catholicism.  Sound familiar?  It's like the Cold War, but instead of communism, it was religion.  You had Americans and Mexicans, both holdin' onto their beliefs tight, like a dog with a bone. \n\nThey went at it somethin' fierce, these two.  Border skirmishes, bandits runnin' amok, it was a mess.  But eventually, things cooled down.  Mexico got real reliant on America for stuff, and America's focus shifted from takin' land to makin' money.   They found a way to get along, after all that ruckus.",
            "Fifteen years ago, somethin' hit me outta nowhere, like a ton of bricks. I got this sickness, one I never even knew existed. Back then I was a nurse, ya know? I'd always figured that'd be my gig - everyone's gotta get sick sometime, right?  Always thought I'd be a scientist or a writer, maybe both, but I went with the safe bet. \"Nursing's a sure thing,\" folks kept sayin', \"you'll always have work.\" So, here I was, 46, single, and nothin' in the bank, suddenly unable to work. This illness, it messed me up good.  Fifteen years on disability, and I'm down to nothin'.  Barely gettin' by, every day's a fight, like I'm right back in that insecure childhood.  Life ain't solid anymore, not one bit. But there's one thing I know for sure: I couldn't have made it this far without my family and a few good friends.  Trust me, when life throws ya a curveball, you don't feel so tough.\n\nSee, life throws you curveballs, big and small. You can plan all ya want, but some things, you just can't handle alone.  \n\nFolks on the right, they talk about \"rugged individualism,\" how that built this country. But back in the day, it wasn't just grit that got 'em through. It was lookin' out for each other, sharin' what you had. Those pioneers who crossed the Rockies, they didn't make it by go'in it alone. They stuck together.\n\n\nSo, yeah, be prepared.  I am. I got a disaster kit, first aid, water purifier, even plastic sheeting for the windows if somethin' nasty ever happens. Flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, canned goods – the whole shebang.  If you got the land, grow your own food, learn to can it. Good idea, especially if you got a wood stove.  But here's the thing, don't forget about your neighbors. Get to know 'em.",
            "Alright, so ya see these fancy scientists, they're tryin' to figure out how critters change over time, right?  It's like, why do they look the way they do?  Is there some kinda rulebook for how evolution works?  Back in 1917, this fella D'Arcy Thompson said we're barely scratchin' the surface of understandin' how to talk about this stuff with numbers.  And ya know what?  He's still right!\n\nBut now, folks are usin' math to try and figure out how shells on these squirmy sea critters called mollusks grow.  It's like, take a picture of the shell at different stages, then use a computer program to see what might happen if it grew in different ways.  Kinda like buildin' a model, ya know?  They're callin' it \"mathematical modeling,\" which sounds fancy, but it's just tryin' to make sense of how things change.\n\nImagine a shell like a snail's house, but instead of brick, it's made of this hard stuff.  It spirals around and around, like a ramp windin' up.  Each turn is called a whorl, and the center is called the columella.  Some shells grow faster in some parts than others, and you can see the lines where the whorls join up.  The biggest part is the last one, called the body whorl.\n\nNow, picture a whole bunch of these shells, like a family history of snails.  Scientists look at how they're all different, how they grew, and try to figure out what made them change.  They're usin' math to help 'em see the patterns and make predictions.  It's like a big puzzle, but instead of pieces, it's shells!",
            "Listen, Indonesia's been doin' alright for the last ten years, y'know? They're gettin' closer to meetin' those fancy Millennium Development Goals, like makin' sure folks have clean water and bathrooms. But when it comes to takin' care of babies and moms, they're fallin' behind.  We gotta do better, ya hear? \n\nNow, they're braggin' about more folks havin' babies with a healthcare worker around. But lemme tell ya, a lot of 'em are just midwives, not real doctors. So what good is that when somethin' goes wrong?  And the thing about kids gettin' sick with the trots, well, they're not seein' doctors much anymore. It's sad, really. And don't even get me started on how they're treatin' moms after they give birth. Ain't right.\n\nC-sections are too low, especially in the sticks. It's like they're forgettin' folks out there in the country.  Those folks in the cities, they got it good. But the poor? They ain't got a chance. They can't afford healthcare, you see?\n\nSo what do we do? Should we just throw money at specific problems, or should we fix the whole darn healthcare system? \n\nProgrammatic stuff sounds good, like targetin' just newborn care. It's easier to manage and you see results faster. But here's the rub: if you focus too much on one thing, you forget about everything else. And everyone wants to work on the hot topic, so the rest gets neglected.  It's like a tug-of-war, ya know?",
            "Victorian books are all about the little details and they really love to talk about fancy rich people. But there are a couple of books from that time, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, that don't really follow those rules. They've got this mystery going on and some weird stuff happens, which is different from most books back then.  This mystery stuff helps us understand the characters better, like what they're really thinking and feeling.  \n\nHere's a little bit from Oliver Twist that shows what I mean:\n\n“'He felt like he was stuck between Sikes and Crackit, who were arguing and yelling.  He could even hear them talking, even though he wasn't really there. Then suddenly, he heard a gunshot, and everything around him exploded into chaos. Lights were flashing, people were screaming, and someone grabbed him and started dragging him away.  Through it all, he felt this awful, nagging pain that wouldn't go away.” (Dickens, 220)\n\nThese books use mystery and strange stuff, like dreams, to show you what's going on inside the characters' heads.  In Oliver Twist, these weird dreams tell us about Oliver's pain and how confused he is about what's happening around him. When Oliver gets shot, he has a dream about it again in Chapter 28, and it's like he's reliving the whole thing.  It shows how much pain he's in and how helpless he feels.  He can't even see who's dragging him away because he's so overwhelmed.  Oliver doesn't feel in control of anything, and it makes you wonder if someone is making bad things happen to him on purpose. This shooting shows how much control Oliver has lost.  He doesn't even try to fight back, like maybe someone has broken his spirit and made him give up.\n\n\n“Time just flew by.  One minute it was day, the next it was night again. Night felt long and scary because it was so quiet, but it also felt short because it went by so quickly.”",
            "So, lemme tell ya 'bout this kid, Adrian. Couple years back, I was workin' at this after-school thing, helpin' out little kids with their schoolwork. Now, I was pretty good with English and readin', but this kid Adrian, he was givin' me fits.  He was in third or fourth grade, somethin' like that.  Seemed like he understood some words fine, but others, he'd butcher 'em somethin' fierce. It was like he were speakin' a different language, but he talked perfect English! I was scratchin' my head, wonderin' what was goin' on.  He was Latino,  that much I knew, but his English was spot on. We went round and round, but nothin' seemed to click. Then one day, Adrian's mama came to pick him up. Now, she didn't speak a lick of English, only Spanish.  I was just learnin' a few words myself, but we managed to get by.  That's when it hit me like a ton of bricks – the kid could read fine, he just didn't know his ABCs!  Maybe it wasn't so much a problem with readin', but more like a language problem, you know? I dunno if it helped him much in the long run, but I sure hope he's doin' alright now.\n\nThis whole thing got me thinkin' 'bout how tough it can be for kids who don't speak English well.  We gotta do somethin' about it, right here in California, where there are so many different languages.  It ain't always as clear-cut as you think. Even if a kid speaks English good, readin' it can still be a real pain. \n\nSo, what's the answer? Well, Adrian's case was kinda simple – he just needed help with learnin' the alphabet and how to pronounce the letters. But for kids who barely speak English, it's a whole different ball game. There ain't just one magic bullet. We gotta try different things,  like dual language programs,  where kids learn in both English and their own language.  We gotta have more ESL classes, and maybe even some private tutors. It takes a whole lotta effort, but we gotta do it. \n\nFirst things first, let's talk about these dual language programs. They're great for all kids, not just those who speak Spanish. Lots of folks are scared of 'em, thinkin' they waste money and don't help most kids. But that's just plain wrong. If we used these programs more often, every kid would benefit.\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' every teacher has to be bilingual. That'd be crazy! But we could have special helpers, tutors, whatever ya call 'em, who speak both languages. That'd make a big difference, I tell ya!",
            "Well, lemme tell ya, from the time we're little whippersnappers, folks are always talkin' 'bout somethin' bigger than us, somethin' we can't even wrap our heads around. Some go to church, some go to temple, some just try to figure it out on their own.  Lotta folks just go with what their parents taught 'em, but some folks, they say \"Nah, ain't nothin' out there but what we can see right here.\"  Might change their minds later, but that's life, ain't it?  We all lookin' for somethin', somethin' to make sense of it all, a light in the darkness, you know what I mean?\n\nMy old man, he was a simple fella. One time, I asked him what his favorite bird was and he said a cardinal.  We were sittin' on the porch, rain beatin' down like a drum, smokin' cigarettes.  He looked out at the rain, kinda lost in thought, like he was seein' somethin' only he could see.  He'd gotten real thin, clothes hangin' off him like a sack of potatoes.  His hair was thin too, lettin' the light shine through.  He wouldn't look at me, kept his eyes on the rain.  I felt kinda lost, scared even, 'cause I didn't know how to tell him I was gonna miss him somethin' fierce. Sayin' it out loud would make it real, and that was somethin' neither of us wanted. So I just wrapped my arms around him, sat back down, scooted my chair closer, and joined him in starin' at the rain.\n\nThat was June. My dad passed away in December, just five days after my 22nd birthday. The chemo and radiation, it didn't stop the pain, just dragged it on a little longer. Doctors said he wouldn't make it past a certain point, but he hung on.  I couldn't figure out what good it did, just made things harder.  I thought, \"What kinda God lets this happen?\"  In the dead of night, I didn't even pray.  If there was a God out there, I figured he'd stopped listenin' a long time ago.\n\nI didn't wanna watch him go, so I didn't.  Couldn't stand to see the life that gave me life slip away.  I wanted to remember him for the good times, not the last days.  Besides, I knew him better than anyone else, better than his own family.  I knew he wouldn't want me there, watchin' him die.  So I curled up in bed for three days, waitin' for the news.",
            "Alright, so this \"Gothic Novel\" thing, it's kinda like a mix-up, y'know?  Like, it's old and new at the same time. This writer, Ian Watt, he called it an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New'\".  Some folks say Gothic stories ain't got no depth, while others think they're somethin' special, like they make ya feel somethin' real deep down. \n\nThis first Gothic story, \"The Castle of Otranto\" by Horace Walpole, it took bits and pieces from old stories and new ones to make somethin' brand new.  Walpole, he used stuff from old plays and then mixed it up with how folks were writin' stories back then, and called it a \"Gothic Story\".  He liked usin' stuff from the days of castles and knights, even though back then, folks thought all that was just old hat. They were all about bein' \"modern\" and fancy.\n\nBut here's the thing - Gothic stories got this mix of old and new that made 'em stick around for a long time. They're like a time capsule, y'know?  You read 'em now, and they feel old, but they also feel kinda fresh, like somethin' new.\n\nOne of the big ideas in Gothic stories is this thing called \"Chivalry\". Back in the olden days, folks were all about knights and how they were supposed to be brave and good.  Walpole, he wrote \"The Castle of Otranto\" when things were kinda messed up politically, and he thought maybe folks weren't so chivalrous anymore. So, he wrote about these knights, like this guy Frederic, to show what a real knight should be like.",
            "Let me tell ya, this supply chain thing, it's like a big ol' recipe for gettin' stuff from point A to point B. You got your customer orderin' somethin', and then it's a whole chain reaction, ya know? Raw materials gotta get gathered, stuff gets made, then shipped out to the customer.  This fella, Keith Oliver, back in '82, he came up with the name \"Supply Chain Management.\"  He figured out it's all about plannin' this whole shebang, makin' sure it runs smooth, and gettin' what folks want, quick and easy.\n\nThere's six main parts to this whole thing, kinda like the ingredients in that recipe.  You got production, supply, inventory, where to put things, how to move 'em, and information - gotta keep track of it all!\n\nProduction's the first step, the foundation, like the flour in a cake.  You gotta figure out what folks want,  what they're buyin', like lookin' at the whole market, seein' what's hot.  Then, you decide what to make, how much, where to make it, and make sure the stuff comes out right, like bakin' that cake just right.  Got to be careful, 'cause if somethin's off, it can cost ya big time. Remember when I worked at Walmart and Target? They had all these rules, like a recipe book, for everything! Made sure things ran smooth, no confusion.\n\nThen you got supply, figuring out where you're gonna get your ingredients from.  You might have different parts of your business doin' different things, like makin' the cake batter and the frosting.  You gotta decide who does what best, maybe even gettin' help from other folks, like outsourcing the frosting.  That way, you can get it done faster, cheaper, and still make a darn good cake!",
            "Well, lemme tell ya somethin'. This Ellen Page, she's a real go-getter, standin' on a street corner with a sign sayin' Hitler's still alive in Burma. Now, Burma, that's a rough place, ruled by a bunch of tough guys who took over back in '62. See, they don't like folks speakin' up, kinda like my old man when I was a kid. \n\nA few years back, some monks decided they'd had enough, so they started marchin', wearin' their yellow robes, and callin' it the \"Saffron Revolution.\"  It's like when I get mad about the price of beans, but instead of yellin', they're marchin' and stuff.\n\nWell, the government didn't like it much. They started crackin' down, hurtin' folks, even killin' a few.  They don't want anyone messin' with their power, just like those guys back in the day with big hats and fancy words, tryin' to tell everyone what to think.  \n\nThis ain't nothin' new, though. Seems like folks in power always wanna be in charge, no matter what. They act like they're gods, like that emperor in Rome or that fella in Japan who thought he was a phone company CEO. Even our own president, he hangs out with those guys who think they know everything.\n\nYou remember what happened in China, back in '89?  Students and folks like that, they got together, and the government, well, let's just say they didn't like it much. And then there was Rwanda, where they went after folks just 'cause they were different.\n\nListen, it all boils down to this: folks in power don't like it when you challenge 'em. They wanna be the boss, call all the shots.  It's like tryin' to tell my dog what to do, only a lot more serious.",
            "Now listen, this Duke Ellington fella, he was a real deal jazz cat. He stuck around for a long time, and that means he got real good at making his band sound good. He might not have played the piano loud in all his songs, but boy, could he write some fancy tunes!  He made music where each guy in the band could show off their skills, but he also knew how to get everyone playing together like a well-oiled machine. He could make the whole band sound like one big, amazing voice.  \n\nThis one book about music says Ellington was real good at using voices in jazz, like makin' 'em sound like instruments. He had this song called \"Creole Love Call\" where the voice ain't singin' words, it's just makin' sounds, like a real instrument.  He was all about givin' each musician a chance to shine, and this song shows that. It's slow and bluesy, and it goes through these different parts where different guys get to show off.  You got the voice talkin' back and forth with the wind instruments, then the trumpet plays a solo, all smooth and bluesy. Then the clarinet takes over, all high and fancy. It's like a conversation between all these different sounds. And then the whole band jumps in, makin' it all come together.\n\nHe did the same thing in other songs, too, like \"Hot and Bothered\" and \"It Don't Mean a Thing.\" He'd use a trumpet player and a singer, makin' their voices sound like instruments, and then he'd have a trombone player start a melody, makin' it all sound real special.  Duke Ellington, he knew how to make jazz sound good, and he did it for a long, long time.",
            "She'd always felt like somethin' was missin'. Like there was a hole inside her that nothin' could fill. This feelin' started when she was about fourteen, just gettin' into all that teenage stuff. And it was still there three years later, when she turned seventeen. By then, she'd figured out she wanted some kinda person in her life, not just some shiny thing. But she just couldn't find a boy who caught her eye. A few guys tried to court her, all awkward and clumsy, but none of 'em did nothin' for her. She spent a lot of time wonderin' why this was happenin' to her, tryin' to figure out what was makin' her so different from other girls her age. She had some ideas, but nothin' that really made sense. So she just kept livin' her life, always wonderin' about this empty space inside her.\n\nLife at home was usually pretty peaceful. Her folks were good, calm people. They never fought with each other, and rarely argued with her either. The only time they'd butt heads was when she tried to act more independent, showin' off her own spunky personality. She was the daughter of two mellow folks, but she sure brought the energy, always up for somethin' fun. Everyone liked her 'cause she was sweet and fun-lovin'.\n\nBut today wasn't a peaceful day. She was moseying from room to room, tryin' to find some inspiration, when she heard a little scream from the kitchen. It was her mom's voice, and she sounded scared.  She bolted into the kitchen, worryin' somethin' awful. \"Mom! Mom, what's wrong?\" She saw her mom on the floor, lookin' pale and in pain, whimperin', \"Ow,\" with every breath. She rushed to her mom's side and touched her gently. \"Ouch... sweety, I... need you to take me to... the hospital.\" She was speakin' in short bursts, and it was clear she was hurt bad. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where I need to pick you up.\" Her mom pointed, and her daughter, strong from all those self-defense classes, knew just what to do. She carried her mom to the car, set her down gently in the back seat, and drove like a bat outta hell.\n\nThe hospital smelled like antiseptic and sickness, but all she could think about was helpin' her mom. She rushed her inside, yellin' for a doctor. A bunch of worried faces gathered around, and someone quickly got a gurney and laid her mom down. They took her away for treatment, leavin' her daughter sittin' there, worry gnawin' at her insides.\n\nTurns out, her mom had fallen off a step stool while reachin' for a vase high up on a shelf.",
            "This here study's tryin' to show that eatin' like folks in the Mediterranean, you know, that \"Mediterranean Diet\" stuff, keeps your ticker tickin' good and helps you avoid strokes. They got this fancy name for it, \"alternate Mediterranean diet\" or somethin', but it's all about eatin' your veggies, fruits, nuts, and fish, and cuttin' back on the meat and greasy stuff. A little vino ain't gonna hurt neither.\n\nSee, folks have been sayin' for a while now that this Mediterranean eatin' helps keep you healthy, but nobody really focused on strokes before. This study followed a bunch of nurses for 20 years, ask'em what they ate every few years, and low and behold, the ones who ate the most Mediterranean, they had less heart problems and strokes. \n\nThey measured all sorts of things too, like how much they weighed, if they smoked, if they took vitamins, and if they were hoppin' around or sittin' on their duffs. Then they crunched the numbers and found that the more Mediterranean you ate, the less likely you were to have a heart attack or stroke. Pretty simple, really.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya, back in 2007, this whole country went belly up.  Jobs disappeared faster than a shot of whiskey, the housing market crashed harder than a drunk at a rodeo, and all them big fancy companies were left lookin' like a dog that ate a whole watermelon.  This mess ain't gone away yet, so we gotta ask ourselves, what in tarnation happened and how do we fix it?\n\nSee, this whole financial crisis was like a bad case of the clap, caught by them politicians makin' decisions that were about as smart as a possum in a headlock. They pushed banks and folks to give out loans like candy at Halloween, even to folks who couldn't afford a bag of chips. And these fancy folks at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, they took these loans and bundled them up into these complicated things called CDO's and CDS'. When folks started missin' their payments, the banks were left holdin' the bag, and the whole dang economy went kablooey!\n\nThis whole mess started back in '99, when President Clinton was tryin' to get re-elected. He wanted folks to like him, so he loosened up the rules on givin' out loans. It was like lettin' a bunch of toddlers loose with a whole candy store, only instead of candy, it was loans. And just like a toddler with a candy store, it all ended in a sticky mess.\n\nThen they started creatin' these newfangled mortgages, like adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and these things called CDO's. They were all fancy words for makin' things even more complicated, and it was like tangled fishing line, just makin' the whole mess worse. Folks were borrowin' money they didn't have, and the housing market got all inflated like a hot air balloon.  \n\nAnd then, just like a balloon with a hole in it, the bubble burst. All them banks that bought these fancy mortgage packages were left holdin' the bag, and the whole country went into a tailspin.",
            "Alright, listen up, ya'll. This here's about exposition, that part of a story where you gotta show off your fancy writer's skills, or else your readers might just fall asleep faster'n a catfish in a mud puddle.  I'm talkin' 'bout the stuff that makes 'em wanna slam that \"Back\" button harder'n a slammed truck door.  Even ol' Dr. Merlin, she gets frustrated with Too Much Information. Not the fun kind, mind you, the kinda info that makes ya wanna scream, \"Get to the point, ya dang story!\"\n\nNow, you folks know the golden rule, \"Show, don't tell,\" right? But even I stumble sometimes, spillin' out pages and pages of nothin' happenin', or worse, too darn much happenin'. That's exposition, my friends. It's like that little devil whisperin' in your ear, tellin' ya to get all the backstory outta the way so you can get to the good stuff.  But hold your horses! Don't go tellin' your readers every darn thing about every character's childhood, got it?\n\nExposition is like that character in a movie who just lays it all out, spoutin' info like a broken record.  Or, in a story, it's the author doin' the talkin', layin' it all on thick.\n\nLet me give ya an example. Imagine a story where the heroine met her hubby in a fancy place, got hitched in a big ol' ceremony, and then BAM! He's murdered right in front of her. You wouldn't wanna read two pages of nothin' but tellin' about that, would ya?  You'd expect somethin' more, somethin' with heart.  Show me the husband's love for his wife through his words and actions. Show me how he changed her life.  Make me feel somethin'!\n\nDon't just tell me they met, got married, and he died. Give me the juicy details!  \n\nSee, that's what exposition is all about. You gotta give your readers somethin' to sink their teeth into. Don't be stingy with the details, folks!",
            "Man, I watched a couple of news things from Columbus, Ohio the other day. \n\nFirst up was NBC 4, live this mornin' (August 13th, 2011). They had this story 'bout a fella in Ashley, Ohio who stabbed his wife real bad. Didn't say her name, but the guy's name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot, and lemme tell ya, the dude looked like a snake in a Sunday suit! They only talked about it for, like, two minutes, sayin' he stabbed her a bunch of times and got hauled off. Seemed about right to me, givin' it a couple of minutes while they figured things out.\n\nNext, they talked about this Travis Buyers, 18 years old, got shot real bad in the Sharon Woods area. No one knew who did it, SWAT was on the case. I gotta say, they didn't spend much time on this one. You know why? I bet it's 'cause this fella was black, or maybe he lived in a black neighborhood. It's like the news forgets folks like that got problems too. If a white kid got hurt, they'd be all over it, but if it's a black person, they barely even mention it. \n\nThen they talked about a bullet hole in one of them Med-Flight helicopters. Said it was a .22 from a rifle. They were offerin' five grand for any tips that led to the jerk who shot it.\n\nThey threw in a quickie about the rain comin' this weekend, said it'd be in the eighties, yadda yadda. Just teasin' ya to keep watchin', I guess.\n\nThey also had this story about a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road. They said the robber was a dark-skinned black man, wearin' a hoodie, about six feet tall and 150 pounds. Seemed kinda weird to me how much they hammered on about him bein' black.\n\nAnd finally, they talked about this Rene Rodriguez, a drug dealer from Texas who got caught slingin' weed to Ohio. He got 300 months, which is 25 years, right?  They kept sayin' 300 months, like it was supposed to sound scarier.  And they mentioned he was Hispanic, but what does that have to do with anything?",
            "Brothers, man, they got this bond, you know? Like, it's unbreakable, like somethin' you can't explain. It's got all kinds of stuff in it, love, yeah, but also pride, jealousy, even mean stuff sometimes. You know, brothers, they get each other, more than anybody else. It's like lookin' in a mirror, seein' yourself but somehow different, you know? And when things get tough, that bond, it really shows its true colors, good or bad.  It ain't always pretty, but it's real.  This story, \"The Scarlet Ibis\", it's all about that, about these two brothers and all the crazy feelings they got for each other.\n\nThey're runnin' around this beautiful place, but they're on a trip that ain't gonna end well. There's this bitter disappointment, like, they're both tryin' so hard but it ain't workin' out. Then there's this pride, this big ol' mess of pride, and it all comes to a head. In the end, only one brother makes it out alive.  \n\nThe story tells you about these emotions through the main guy, Doodle, and how he acts.  And it also tells you about how he sees the world, which is important 'cause that shapes how he acts.  It's all tied together, see?\n\n\nThe main guy, he's all about that pride, from the start. He wants a brother who can keep up with him, you know, someone to do all these cool things with. But Doodle, he's weak, he can't do any of that.  The main guy, he gets mad, even thinks about smotherin' the little kid. Can you believe that? But then Doodle smiles at him, and bam! All the anger melts away.  See, deep down, he loves his brother.",
            "Ya know, the brain, it's a heck of a thing.  Folks used to say it was like a wax tablet, then a piece of paper, then a book. Now they say it's like a computer. But, lemme tell ya, those are just fancy words for somethin' complicated. \n\nSee, information comes in through your senses - touch, sound, sight, all that jazz. Your brain takes that stuff and messes with it, like a recipe.  First, it breaks it down, little by little, like lookin' at a box.  Then, it puts it all back together, faster than you can say \"jack rabbit.\"  It's like, if you see a box, your brain says, \"Hey, that's a box!\"  But it's not just seein' the box, it's knowin' it's a box, not a hole.\n\nNow, your brain ain't just a sponge soakin' up everything. It's got a filter, like a bouncer at a club.  It says, \"Hey, this is important, pay attention!\" and \"Nah, this ain't worth your time.\"  Like, you see a bunch of grass, but you don't notice each blade. But if your name gets called out in a crowd, boom, you hear it! \n\nThe brain also got this memory thing goin' on. It stores stuff, like a big ol' warehouse.  It's got different rooms for different kinds of stuff - short-term, long-term, all that.  And it remembers by makin' connections, like a spider web.  So when you remember somethin', it's like followin' a thread through the web.",
            "Alright, so this Huxley fella, he's givin' us the lowdown on how technology and big ol' corporations are gonna mess us all up someday. He writes this book, \"Brave New World,\" and it's a real downer.  Everyone in this world is all about being part of the crowd and gettin' their instant gratification fix.  They don't care about bein' individuals, 'cause the big boss man, the World Controller, tells 'em what to think and do. \n\nHuxley's kinda like a Marxist, see? He sees how these rich folks are usin' this system to keep the rest of us dumb and happy, just workin' and spendin' all the time. He calls it \"false consciousness.\"  It's like they're puttin' a blindfold on us so we don't see how the real world works.  We're all just pawns in their game, chasin' after the next shiny thing, and they're siphonin' off all the dough.\n\nThese folks in the book, they got these different classes, like the Deltas, Gammas, and all that.  They're all conditioned from birth to be happy with their lot in life,  even if it means they're bein' used.  They don't even know they're bein' used!\n\nAnd the worst part is, the people at the top, the Alphas and Betas, they know what's goin' on, but they don't care. They just keep on enjoyin' their fancy lives, leavin' the rest of us to rot.\n\nHuxley even shows how this system crushes real human connection. Nobody in this world has any real feelings, no deep thoughts, nothin'.  They're just talkin' about how good lookin' the chicks are or how many times they slept with 'em. It's all just surface stuff.  \n\nIt's like Huxley's sayin', if we keep lettin' technology and big corporations run our lives, we're gonna lose our humanity. We'll become nothin' more than robots, followin' orders and spendin' all our time on empty pleasures.",
            "Been at this University Park place for a couple years now, almost three.  Gotta say, getting around this campus is a real pain in the neck. Back when I was livin' in  East Halls, which is like, way outta the way,  getting to classes down near Willard building felt like a cross-country trek. Sometimes, especially when the weather was crappier than a week-old burger, it took me a good 25 minutes just to walk there. Talked to an old-timer who graduated not too long ago, and he told me how they used to have all this empty space between East Halls and the rest of campus. Now, they've crammed in all these new buildings, sports fields, and apartments. With all the changes, it's getting harder and harder to get around.  What's the solution? Bikes, man!  \n\nHad a buddy tell me the other day how he'd gotten back into ridin' bikes. Said it was the only way to get around, and he was glad he'd started again.  You know, bikes are good for ya, plus they're the fastest way to get from here to there. You can ride a bike with just some oatmeal in your belly and cover 30 miles without breaking a sweat. I live off campus now, just as far from the center of campus as some of those dorms.  Best thing I did this year was buy myself a bike.  \n\nMy classes are in Thomas building, which is a good 25-minute walk from my place. But on my bike? Five minutes, tops!  The only problem is  Pollock Road ain't always the safest route. It's a straight shot, but there are times when it's a real pain to ride.  Walkin' ain't bad, but I ain't got the time. If I didn't have my bike, I'd be walkin'  to Thomas every day, which would be a good 30-40 minutes each way. That's over two and a half hours a week just walkin' to class! Add to that all the other places I gotta go, and it'd be a real time suck."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

I reckon I got a few things to offer this social work gig, like bein' helpful, treatin' folks right, doin' things the right way, and tryin' to make things better between people. And I'm talkin' 'bout makin' myself better too, so I can do my job real good.\n\nTruth be told, I always wanted to help folks out, but I wasn't sure how.  In high school and college, I saw folks runnin' from their problems, avoidin' 'em like the plague. Some tried to cope, but not real good, if ya catch my drift. I even got a degree in psychology from Piedmont College back in '09, just tryin' to figure things out.\n\nThen one summer, I met this sixteen-year-old kid, nervous as a cat in a room full of rocking chairs. My friend told me he was runnin' from his abusive parents. The next day, I found out he called the cops on 'em. So, I figured I'd see what I could do, so I went over to their house. I talked to the cops, told 'em I was a psychology grad from Piedmont. They asked me to talk to the parents 'cause there wasn't much they could do for the kid. When I questioned 'em, they were all jumpy and makin' excuses about their son bein' manipulative for gettin' the cops involved. That's when I knew, I gotta be a social worker, helpin' kids caught in these family messes.\n\nAnother thing that's important to me is social justice.  We say we value each person, but sometimes it feels like we just want everyone to be the same. I'm me, and I ain't afraid to be different.  Back in school, I protested against injustice whenever I could.  Colored my hair crazy colors, wore what I wanted, pierced my ears, joined that GSBA group, stood up against racism and discrimination. I believe in social justice, and I'll keep fightin' for it.",
            "Alright, so this here paper's gonna talk about two ways of lookin' at insomnia - the \"sciencey\" way and the \"people and their surroundings\" way.\n\nThe sciencey way, they call it the biological model, focuses on stuff like your genes and your overall health. It's all about how your body's wired to sleep and what happens when things go wrong. \n\nThen there's the \"people and their surroundings\" way, which is called the sociocultural model. This one looks at how your environment, your family, your neighborhood, and even your job can affect your sleep. \n\nThis paper's gonna go through both these models and talk about some studies that tried to figure out how they work.  We'll also talk about the good and bad parts of each study, ya know, like what they got right and where they might have missed the mark.\n\nNow, sleep problems can come in all shapes and sizes. Sometimes they're just about sleep itself - like trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. Other times, they're connected to other stuff going on in your head, like stress or anxiety. And sometimes they're caused by medical conditions or things you're taking.\n\nThe paper's gonna focus mainly on insomnia, which is that trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. It'll also touch on other sleep problems that are similar.\n\nOne study looked at something called the GABAB receptor. Turns out, this little fella in your brain is important for sleep.  They did some experiments on mice, and found that messing with this receptor can mess with their sleep.  It's kinda like a light switch for sleep. \n\nSo what does this mean for us humans? Well, it means that our genes might play a role in how well we sleep. And if something's wrong with that GABAB receptor, it could make it harder to get a good night's rest.",
            "Alright, so listen up, 'cause I'm gonna tell ya about this thing called CAPD. It's basically when your brain, the big boss, can't quite figure out what it's hearing. Think of it like this: you can hear perfectly fine, but your brain's like, \"Huh? What was that?\" \n\nNow, back in the day, folks called it \"auditory imperception,\" like it was some kinda secret code. But these smart folks started figuring out that it wasn't just kids not paying attention, it was their brains messing up the sound signals. They started doing tests to see how people's brains handled sounds, like trying to tell apart two words said at the same time. \n\nSo, what happens when someone's got CAPD? Well, they might have a hard time telling where a sound is coming from, or they might mix up similar sounds. It's like trying to follow a conversation when there's a lot of noise around. They might even miss cues in someone's voice, like sarcasm or jokes. \n\nNow, how do you know if someone's got CAPD? Well, you gotta watch how they listen and do some tests. It's kind of like a detective trying to solve a mystery. They'll ask questions, play sounds, and see how the person reacts. There ain't no magic bullet test, but they'll look for patterns and clues.",
            "So this play, Twelfth Night, it's sayin' somethin' about pretendin'. See, it can work for a while, keepin' up a fake face, but eventually, you gotta drop the act.  Otherwise, you might just lose yourself, ya know? The problem is, when you do let the truth out, things can get messy.  Folks might get mad, feel betrayed. It's a tough choice, like pickin' between yourself and your friends. Some folks might not care if you've been tellin' fibs, but others, well, they get their feelings hurt easy.\n\nNow, this whole pretendin' thing gets even trickier when it comes to switchin' up your gender. Why'd ya wanna pretend to be someone you ain't? \n\nTake Viola, for example. She's gotta put on a guy's clothes to stay safe in a foreign land.  It's a way to protect herself, see? But guess what? It pushes her away from other women, the folks she coulda relied on.  And then things get even weirder when Olivia, this woman, falls head over heels for her, thinkin' she's a dude!  And don't forget, Viola's got feelings for Orsino, but she can't let on, 'cause she's playin' the part.  It's a tangled web!\n\nThis play, it kinda shows how fakin' it can bring out hidden stuff, like feelings you ain't even aware of.  Maybe Olivia's drawn to Viola 'cause she's disguised as a man, or maybe, just maybe, Olivia's got some feelings for women she's keepin' under wraps.  \n\nBut here's the thing, this Olivia, she's probably just makin' fun of folks who judge others by their looks.  She switches her affections from Viola to Sebastian real quick, like it's nothin'.  She even starts seein' Viola as family, not a lover.  So maybe it ain't so much about hidden feelings, but more about pointin' out how folks can be shallow.",
            "Alman, y'all know how the Germans were real meanies back in the day, especially to them folks in South West Africa. They went and did some real messed up stuff there, like wiping out whole groups of people. But you gotta remember, not every part of the German empire was like that. Some places were good, some were bad, just like everywhere else. \n\nNow, when it came to schoolin' folks, it was the same way. Some places, like East Africa, the Germans built schools and taught the local folks to read and write.  People back then even said how great the Germans were doin' with education in places like Kamerun. \n\nBut down in South West Africa, things were different. They didn't have much interest in teachin' the local people. Mostly, it was left up to the churches to do that, and they didn't get much help from the government. The Germans, though, they were all about schoolin' their own folks. They built schools for them and helped the churches run their schools too.\n\nThis messed things up for South West Africa for a long time, even after the Germans left. While other places had lots of folks who could read and write, in South West Africa, most people couldn't even read a lick. \n\nThere are lots of books written about how the Germans ran their colonies, mostly back when they were still in charge.  Some folks even compared how things worked in different places, like East Africa and South West Africa. They found that the Germans treated folks differently in each place, and that's what this paper wants to talk about.",
            "Listen,  music's changed a whole bunch in the last hundred years. There's so many dang types now, like rock, country, rap, jazz, and even folk.  And each of those has got a bunch of little types too, like little pups in a litter. Heavy metal's one of those that really went wild, man. It's like a big ol' family reunion, but instead of cousins, you got  sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, all rippin' and roarin'. \n\nIt's got all these different emotions, mostly the dark ones, like anger, sadness, and a whole lotta angst. But it's also really good at showin' off how talented these musicians are. \n\nIt's hard to say what metal even is anymore, 'cause it's borrowed from so many other things. But we gotta go back to the start, y'know? To see where this whole thing came from. Metal ain't just some genre, it's a whole movement, like a wildfire sweepin' through the music world. \n\nMetal's all about bein' loud, man. More bass, more volume, more everything! It's raw, it's real, and it's not afraid to get dark. Back in the 70s, folks were takin' a lot of drugs, and that messed with their heads in a good way. They started makin' music that sounded like it came from another planet. It was heavy, it was weird, and it was different.  \n\nMetal's got this darkness to it, somethin' that wasn't really around much in popular music before. Like, even the Beatles got in on it - that song \"Helter Skelter\" is pretty darn dark. It was like they were tryin' to prove they could be just as heavy as the Rolling Stones.  That's the heart of metal, man. It's about bein' raw, bein' real, and not shyin' away from the darkness.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya 'bout this fella, Henri Rousseau. Before them fancy Surrealists got all weird with their paintin', this guy was dreamin' up his own kinda dreams, you know?  He was a Post-Impressionist, real good, did a picture called \"The Dream\" way back in 1910. It ain't just some lady lookin' at pretty stuff in her sleep, it's Rousseau pourin' his heart and soul into it. He wanted everyone to like his art, ya know, the critics, the fancy folks. But he was stuck in a pickle.  Should he paint like everyone else to get ahead, or just be himself and hope for the best? That's what this \"Dream\" picture is all about, his big ol' struggle. \n\nNow, this Rousseau fella, he wasn't born with a silver spoon, that's for sure.  Grew up in France, his daddy sold stuff, but nothing fancy.  Never went to art school, worked for the government collectin' tolls, even got called a customs inspector though he wasn't. Lost his wife and kids, poor fella, so he picked up a paintbrush to escape his troubles. He wanted to paint like the common folk, tell their stories, ya know?  But the art world was tough, full of fancy artists who knew all the tricks.  He was older than most, and trying to catch up.\n\nHe wanted to be one of the big shots, just like Matisse, another famous painter, but they were different. Matisse was all about bein' unique,  Rousseau just wanted to fit in, paint what everyone expected and get accepted.",
            "Dang, folks, ya know how some smart guys say bein' good and lookin' pretty is like twins?  I reckon they're right.  Like that fella Keats said, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - That's all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" We learn a lot from schoolin' and livin', but knowin' right from wrong and what's beautiful, well, that just kinda hits ya. \n\nSee, we ain't taught how to appreciate art or good deeds, we just know it when we see it.  It's like tryin' to explain what makes a good song - you can talk about the chords and rhythm, but that ain't the whole story.  It's somethin' more, somethin' you feel deep down.\n\nNow, take that fancy Mona Lisa everyone's always goin' on about. You can talk about the paintin' all day long, but it's that somethin' else, that je ne sais quoi, that makes it tick. \n\nFigured that's how it is with good things, whether it's art or bein' a decent human. There's more to it than just the words or actions, there's somethin' deeper, somethin' that moves ya.\n\nThat's why art and morals are so darn close, 'cause they both touch us in that special way, deep down inside. You can't explain it, but you sure feel it.\n\nAnd when it comes to stories, well, that's somethin' else entirely.  Stories are like lookin' into the soul, they tell ya things you can't say out loud.",
            "Germany today is a strong country with a unique culture all its own. You can feel it everywhere, from the mountains of München to the city of Kiel by the Baltic Sea. Whether you're in Köln on the Rhine River, in the heart of the country, or in Dresden on the Elbe, the German culture is unmistakable.\n\nIt shouldn't surprise us that Germany, as we know it today, came from many different tribes and groups.  \n\n\"Germania\" is the old name for the land where the Germans came from.  \n\nScholars and historians still debate where the name \"German\" came from.  Some say it comes from a group called the Tungrians, who fought the Gauls a long time ago.  Others say Julius Caesar used the word \"Germanus\" to describe the tribes he fought across the Rhine River. He was trying to tell the difference between the Gauls, who he had conquered, and the Germans, who he hadn't. Some people think \"German\" came from a word the Gauls used to describe their neighbors.  Caesar himself wrote about the Germans in his writings about the Gallic Wars, saying they were constantly fighting with the Gauls.\n\nThere are other ideas too. Some think it comes from the spear they used in battle, called a \"ger.\" Others think it comes from an old Irish word meaning \"to shout,\" because the Germans were known for being loud. \n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote a book about the Germans called \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" and in it, he said he thought the Germans were the original people of the land and hadn't mixed with other races. He thought people wouldn't have chosen to move to Germany, with its wild land and harsh weather, unless it was their home. \n\nThe Romans did send troops to Germania for goods and to fight, but they didn't want to live there. \n\nThe Germanic tribes began appearing near the Roman Empire in the first century. They lived on the borders and traded goods and even served in the Roman army.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya, I was lookin' at this here mess, and my brain just wasn't catchin' on.  I was starin' at it, but it was like my mind was on vacation, ya know?  Just takin' it all in, but not really gettin' nothin' outta it.  Thoughts were poppin' in and out faster than a jackrabbit, never stickin' around long enough to make any sense.  It was like watchin' a movie on fast forward, seein' all the action but missin' the story.\n\nOnce, this artist buddy of mine, he told me to check out this book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\"  I always wanted to learn how to draw, ever since I was a little whippersnapper, and this book was supposed to teach ya everything, from how to hold a pencil right to how your brain sees lines and stuff.  One trick they teach is to put a square around whatever ya want to draw, like a frame, and that way, even if somethin's super complicated, ya can just focus on the basics.\n\nWell, lookin' at this thing in front of me, I couldn't picture that frame, couldn't break it down like that.  I was just floored, man, overwhelmed.  Like, Picasso had his blue phase, Monet loved them green things, and all them fancy Renaissance painters, they used every color under the sun.  If I was gonna call myself an artist, this here was my start, my own masterpiece, \"Work in Brown.\"  \n\nSo I picked up my tool of the trade, ya know, got my hand all ready, and I'm thinkin' this is gonna be the most creative moment of my life.  The water was swirlin' around, nice and smooth, clear as day.  Little bits of stuff were breakin' off, floatin' away.  But then, my hand gets all tense, shakin' a little, and BAM!  I slam the toilet handle again.  That brown package wouldn't budge, stuck like glue to the bottom.\n\nI got my mop, standin' there with my tie feelin' like it was chokin' me, just starin' at this thing someone left behind.  A message for the poor saps who clean bathrooms at Rite Aid, I guess.  Flushed a couple more times, tried to get my mind back in the game, but then I just reached for the toilet paper, wrapped myself up like a goddamn mummy.  Standing up straight, bendin' over, I reach into the bowl, like a mama bird checkin' on her nest…",
            "Now listen up, folks. Those young whippersnappers, they're gettin' killed behind the wheel somethin' fierce! Why? Well, their brains ain't fully cooked yet, ya know? It's like tryin' to run a marathon with a cold. They got no experience, nothin' but a learner's permit and a whole lotta bravado. \n\nI'm tellin' ya, those kids, they're like a bunch of chickens runnin' around a henhouse. They can't handle the pressure, especially when they got their buddies in the car.  Got a study done in California, shows the more passengers, the more accidents. Makes sense, right? \n\nThey tryin' to fix things with these temporary licenses, but it's like puttin' a bandaid on a broken leg. We gotta go deeper, see? These kids, they crave that thrill, that rush. Like, they ain't even 18 yet and they're thinkin' they're invincible. This psychologist, Zuckerman, he says even 18 is too young.  \n\nListen, we gotta wait 'til they grow up a bit, ya know? Let 'em have their fun, but not behind the wheel. By the time the baby boomers' kids are old enough to drive, we'll be lookin' at a real mess. \n\nWe need to make a law, a real law, not just some flimsy rule. Let 'em learn in school, but no drivin' 'til they're older. Maybe 19 or 20, when they've calmed down a little. Then, they can get their driver's permit, take some lessons, and show they're ready. \n\nIt ain't rocket science. We gotta protect these kids. This ain't no joke.",
            "So I was lookin' at all these old Edison movies, the Library of Congress has a bunch of 'em. I figured I'd check out the trick films, you know, the ones that play with your eyes.  There were fifteen of 'em, made between 1895 and 1901.  Mostly they just use cuttin' and pastin' together to make things look spooky or funny.  I kinda wanted to figure out how they did it, ya know, the tricks of the trade.\n\nMost of these old trick films stick to the same kinda thing. They're filmed in a little stage-like set, with the camera just sittin' there, not movin' around. Like they're watchin' a play or somethin'.  They don't use any fancy camera tricks, just long shots where you can see the whole thing at once.  And they never get real close up on nothin'.   It's like they're tryin' to show you the whole picture, like you're in the front row of a theater.\n\nNow, there are a few films, later on, that get a little wild and start usin' more than one shot.  But for the most part, they stick to this one-shot, one-movie deal.  So these films aren't real long, maybe a minute or two, just enough time for a quick trick or gag.  It's like a vaudeville act, y'know, quick and flashy.\n\nBut even though they only use one shot, sometimes they'll splice together a bunch of 'em to make it look like somethin' is apparin' or disappearin'.  Take that old film about Mary, Queen of Scots, for example. Looks like one shot, but if you really pay attention, you can see where they cut it together.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya 'bout this fella, John Taylor. He was a real firecracker when it came to this whole Republican thing, especially back in the day. You could tell he was a farmer, rough around the edges, but he knew his stuff.  This guy believed in freedom, plain and simple.  He thought the government shouldn't stick its nose in folks' business, especially when it came to how they made a livin'.  \n\nSee, John, he thought the United States had a real chance to do things right, build something special.  He figured we didn't have all that old-world baggage to hold us back, so we could make a system that worked for the people.  He was all about folks having the right to do their own thing, and he thought the government should stay outta the way.  \n\nNow, this John, he believed in this whole \"good and bad\" thing, like everybody's got a little bit of both in 'em.  He thought the government needed to keep an eye on that bad stuff, make sure it didn't get outta control. But, he didn't want the government to be too powerful, ya know? He wanted to keep it small and simple, just like he liked his farm.  \n\nJohn was a stickler for the Constitution, too.  He thought the government should only do what the Constitution said it could, and no more.  He didn't want some big, fancy government runnin' things, spendin' all our money and tellin' us what to do.  He thought the Founding Fathers had it right, and that's how we should keep it.",
            "Listen, we had this thing goin' on, tryin' to get folks to use less cars and walk or bike more. Figured it'd be a hoot, right? But lemme tell ya, it was a real struggle.  We saw these numbers droppin' fast around December, like folks just forgot all about it. Makes sense, I guess. Winter's comin' on, folks are busy with school and Christmas, and then everyone's gone on break. Even I get lazy when it's cold and snowy! We tried to get folks back on track with a \"Carpool Challenge\" in March, and that helped a bit. But it's tough, you know? People just love their cars. It's kinda like what I said about my pool, doin' it yourself is cheaper, but it takes a lot more work.  Give folks a free hybrid car, now that's somethin' that might get them movin'! We gave out gift cards and stuff, but maybe we shoulda gone bigger, ya know?  We coulda had a raffle, a big ol' prize draw! Might've kept folks more interested.",
            "You know how there's these things called ETFs, like investment clubs but fancier? They're supposed to be like a basket of stocks all rolled into one, kinda like a shortcut to owning a bunch of stuff at once. \n\nYou get the good parts of owning a bunch of different stocks, but with less fuss.  It's cheaper than some other ways of investing, but you still gotta pay a little somethin' somethin' every time you buy or sell. \n\nThe trick is, sometimes the \"shortcut\" ain't always the best shortcut.  Like, if you buy this ETF,  IHF, it's got a bunch of different stocks inside it, ten of 'em make up most of the deal.  So, I'm thinkin', maybe it's smarter to just buy those ten stocks straight up instead of through the ETF.  \n\nWe gotta figure out if buying the whole ETF is really better than buyin' those top ten stocks yourself.  It might sound complicated, but we're gonna look at how much money each stock in the ETF makes, and how risky it is. \n\nWe'll see if buying the whole ETF is really worth it, or if you'd be better off picking the top ten stocks yourself.",
            "So, this Poe fella, he wrote this poem called \"Dream-Land\", and he thinks it's pretty darn good.  In it, he uses this word \"Thulé\" a couple of times, and some smart guy named Mabbott says Poe probably got it from this old dude Virgil. Virgil wrote about an island called Thulé way up north, like beyond the edge of the world back then. Now, Virgil did use the word, but I bet Poe got it from a German writer named Goethe too.\n\nSee, Poe loved reading German stuff. And this Goethe guy, he wrote a famous play called \"Faust\",  about this guy who makes a deal with the devil.  There's this little poem inside \"Faust\" called \"The King of Thulé\", and it's about a king who loses his wife and goes totally bonkers. He drinks a whole lot, cries his eyes out, and finally decides to end it all. Kinda sounds like Poe's character in \"Dream-Land\",  don't it?  Maybe Poe was just channeling his own heartache through that poem.\n\nNow, this \"Faust\" thing was also made into a play around the time Poe was writing \"Dream-Land\".  So there's that connection too.  Poe used \"Thulé\" two times in his other writings, and he booksends \"Dream-Land\" with it. It's almost like he's putting those poems together, like puzzle pieces. In \"Dream-Land\", the speaker talks about this dark, lonely place, haunted by dead friends, kinda like that king in \"The King of Thulé\" after he loses his wife.\n\nSo, you gotta remember, Goethe was a big deal back then, and Poe knew his work. Even if it was just because Poe liked this other guy, Tennyson, who also liked Goethe.  Poe probably saw a lot of Goethe's stuff floating around.",
            "So there's this lady, Jennifer Palmer, who fell in a grocery store 'cause some applesauce was spilled.  She's sayin' the manager, this guy Martin, knew about the spill 'cause his employees told him about it twice, but he just ignored it 'cause he was eatin' dinner.  Palmer got hurt pretty bad, and now she wants the store to pay her some extra money called \"punitive damages\" 'cause she says Martin acted mean and reckless. \n\nNow, the judge ain't gonna just throw out her case right away.  To get those extra damages, Palmer gotta prove Martin knew his actions could hurt someone - like, he knew it was dangerous to leave that applesauce there.  She can say that Martin shoulda known 'cause people had been slipping and falling in the store all year.   \n\nWhether or not Martin was bein' straight up mean is a bit harder to prove. But, if six folks already fell and he still didn't clean up, it ain't lookin' good for him. \n\nIt all went down back in '09. A worker named Rich told Martin about the spill, but Martin said he didn't have time 'cause he was eatin'.  Another worker, Mary, told him again, and Martin said the same thing. Then, an hour later, Palmer went and slipped and hurt her back. \n\nNow, Palmer's sayin' she wants money for her hurt and for Martin bein' a real jerk. California law kinda says if someone acts mean or reckless, they can pay extra damages.  It ain't easy to prove, but Palmer thinks she can show that Martin knew what he was doin' was wrong.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya somethin'. Back when I took that Islam class at CBC, almost four years ago, we were always talkin' about whether Islam was a bad religion or not.  Seems like that question's even more important now than it was back then. You see, since 9/11, the news folks went from thinkin' Islam was the devil to thinkin' it was all sunshine and roses.  I bet you wouldn't have seen a guy like Barack Obama, with his Muslim family, runnin' for president back in 2001.\n\nNow, this book about Muhammad, well, it's somethin' else. See, back in the day, I thought Muhammad was a real tough guy, conquerin' tribes and makin' 'em turn Muslim or else. But this book, it paints him like some kinda martyr, misunderstood and humble.  Folks came to him all on their own, seein' the light, like they were drawn to him.\n\nAnd wouldn't ya know it, there's some similarities between how Muhammad did things and what Jesus did. Like that time he turned some mutton and milk into enough for forty guys?  Sounds like somethin' Jesus woulda done, don't it?  It makes me think they're tryin' to make Muhammad look like some kinda holy man, like he didn't need to prove nothin'.  It's kinda sneaky, ya know, makin' him seem like he's stealin' Jesus' thunder.\n\nPlus, they got all these stories about folks convertin' on their own, like they were just seein' the truth.  But a lot of these stories are second-hand, like they heard it from someone who heard it from someone else.  That makes it all kinda fishy to me.  It's like they're tryin' to make it sound more official, but it just makes me wonder.\n\nWhat really ticks me off is how they try to make Muhammad out to be this gentle, wise, and kinda lovable guy. But history tells a different story.  Was Muhammad really that nice?  I wonder if Muslims today even know the real story about how he came to power.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya somethin'.  Ever since Jesus hung up his sandals, folks been puttin' their own spin on what he taught.  Like, it's gone way off track, ya know?  The world's gettin' all fancy and progressive, but those stuck in their ways, they ain't gonna like it.  But those folks ain't gonna be the ones callin' the shots.  \n\nMark my words, folks are gonna start lookin' back, tryin' to figure out what Jesus really meant, ya know, cuttin' through all the fluff that's been piled on over the years.  It might take a while, maybe decades, maybe even longer, but it's gonna happen.  We're gonna see Christianity go back to its roots, like we're rewindin' a tape.  It's gonna be a whole lotta \"unlearnin'\" goin' on.\n\nAnd this ain't just some hippie dream.  The churches will still be there, leadin' the way, but things are gonna be different.  Folks are gonna start thinkin' alike more, like a big ol' family reunion.  Forget all this different denominations and whatnot,  we're all gonna be singin' from the same hymn book.\n\nHistory's full of these kinda turnarounds, ya know?  Just like the Romans used to hate Christians, then turned around and became Christians themselves.  And look at us, used to have slaves, now we got black folks runnin' the show.  This time, it's gonna be the churches, goin' back to basics, forgettin' all the extra stuff.\n\nNow, this ain't gonna happen overnight. It'll take some doin',  especially with all those folks who take everythin' about the Bible literally.  But we gotta understand what Jesus was really tryin' to say.\n\nSee, way back when, before Jesus came along, there was Judaism.  They believed in one God, and they had their holy books, just like Christians do now.  Back then, they weren't all on the same page though, had all sorts of different groups, just like today.",
            "Listen, folks, this whole \"The Jungle\" thing, it just shows how greedy folks can be. They only care about themselves and makin' a buck, ain't nothin' else that matters.  See, those factory owners, they're all about gettin' bigger and richer, don't give a hoot about the folks workin' for 'em or the mess they're makin'.  Sinclair, he paints a picture of this smoke-filled town, all dirty and nasty, and the bosses, they don't care a lick. They just keep pumpin' out the goods, makin' money, and forgettin' about the people and the planet. \n\nIt's the same with the workers. These bosses, they treat 'em like dirt. They work 'em to the bone, don't pay 'em right, and when they ain't needin' 'em no more, they just toss 'em out on the street.  Back then, there weren't no rules to protect folks, so these factory bosses could do whatever they wanted.\n\nIt's like sayin' these workers were slaves, only they weren't chained up. They had no say in nothin', nothin' but to do as they were told. This whole system, it's just plain wrong. It ain't right to treat people like that.",
            "This here writer guy, he's got a way of makin' ya feel somethin' about what he's talkin' about. Some ways work better than others, ya know?  Like that F. Scott fella, he wrote this book called \"The Great Gatsby\" and he uses all sorts of tricks to get ya feelin' a certain way. Sometimes he'll put words together that don't usually go together, just to make somethin' feel a certain way. Other times, he'll pick an object, like a color, and give it a special meaning, then use that meaning later on to make ya think about somethin' else. This fella, he really liked to use colors, like gold, green, white, gray, and red and pink. In his book \"The Great Gatsby,\" he's got all these special meanings for these colors, especially white and gray and red and pink. Then, he uses those meanings later on to give ya a certain feelin' about important stuff in the story.\n\nSee, he makes white and gray mean kinda like sameness, like everything's the same. White is a bit fancier, more high-class, and gray is more like old and worn out. He starts showin' ya this right at the beginning of the book, with lots of white and gray. Daisy and Jordan, they're always wearin' white, like, all the time. Everyone's wearin' white: Nick's in \"white flannels\" at Gatsby's party, Tom wears a \"white shirt\" when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine's all \"powdered milky white.\" The only time folks aren't wearin' white is when Nick's gettin' his first look at Gatsby's party, and everything's all \"gaudy with primary colors.\" He keeps usin' these colors for everyday stuff too, like when Nick goes to work, he goes down \"the white chasms of lower New York.\"  People's names at Gatsby's party are all \"gray names\" on Nick's list. Catherine's apartment is just one slice in a big \"white cake\" of buildings—it's all the same. He even calls plain people and places white or gray, like Jordan and Daisy had a \"white girlhood\" together, and there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the Valley of Ashes. Even the \"Italian child\" on the railroad is \"gray,\" and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man.\"\n\nAfter he's used white and gray enough, he starts usin' them to show that somethin' ain't that important, or that it's all the same. He does this with Daisy, for instance. After a long time without seein' much white or gray, he writes about Daisy bein' \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster.\" Now, Daisy starts feelin' less like a real person and more like somethin' Gatsby just wants, somethin' that's kinda uniform. He keeps usin' white and gray around Daisy to make ya feel that way. Like, there's a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar,\" and she's wearin' white again before Tom and Gatsby have that big fight.",
            "Well, down in San Diego, the weather's so nice and sunny, they grow all sorts of good stuff. Tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, peppers - you name it! Seems like everyone's going crazy for organic food down there, with folks waitin' forever to get their hands on it. Organic eggs and milk are real popular too. And get this, a lot of those organic farms let you come visit, take a hike, go birdwatching - kinda like a mini-vacation.\n\nYou know, it'd be a good deal for the landowner, makin' money but also helpin' out the environment. They could get some help from the government for makin' things better for the wildlife, while they teach folks about farms and sell some organic goodies. \n\n Now, growin' organic ain't all sunshine and roses, though. It takes a lot more work to keep those bugs and weeds away without chemicals, and sometimes you lose more crops. But on the bright side, it makes things better for all the plants and animals around. They're sayin' you can have more bees and butterflies and all sorts of critters when you don't use all those nasty chemicals.\n\nSo, this landowner's got a real opportunity. They've got this 160-acre piece of land near Potrero, California, with chaparral, grassland, and oak trees. It's right next to the Cleveland National Forest, which is full of all sorts of critters, some of 'em endangered, like the kangaroo rat and the mountain yellow-legged frog. This land's been used for farms and ranches for ages, so it's got a history too.\n\nSeems like this landowner's lookin' for ways to make money while keepin' things natural. They're lookin' into government programs to help them out and seein' what other organic farms in the area are doin'. It's a tough job, but it sounds like they're up for the challenge!",
            "Listen, culture, it's a real big deal when you're tryin' to talk business, ya know? It ain't just some one-size-fits-all thing, like sayin' all folks from one place are the same.  It's more like, understandin' how people from different places tick, what makes 'em tick. You can't just go in there thinkin' everyone's gonna play by the same rules, 'cause they ain't. If you're from Texas and talkin' to folks from, say, New York, well, you gotta remember you're speakin' different languages, kinda.  It ain't just the words, but the whole way you think about things, what's important, what you consider right or wrong.\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' you gotta be best buddies with everyone, but a little respect goes a long way. Learnin' about their customs, their history, even their prejudices, it all helps. Don't go in there tryin' to change 'em, just try to understand 'em. Especially if you're the one who needs somethin' from 'em.  If you're in their neck of the woods, show 'em you respect their way of doin' things.\n\nAnd listen, culture ain't just about countries, it's about companies too. Some companies are all about workin' hard, long hours, others are more laid back.  Pay attention to how they dress, how they talk, who they hire.  It all tells you somethin' about their culture.  Even in America, different companies are different.  You gotta figure out who you're dealin' with and play their game.\n\nBut the most important thing is understandin' their values, what they believe in. If they value savin' face or keepin' things peaceful, you ain't gonna wanna embarrass them in a negotiation. If they're all about gettin' the best deal, you gotta be ready to play tough.\n\nSo, before you sit down at the table, do your homework. Learn about your opponent, their culture, their values. It'll make all the difference in the world.",
            "Well now, these two fellas, Anselm and Aquinas, both want to prove there's a God, right?  They both think there's a God, just like that fella in the Bible said, \"The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’\"   See, they both agree on this God thing, so we gotta figure out who's got the better argument. Now, I'm gonna be honest, neither one of 'em really convinces me completely. \n\nAnselm, he figures God's already in our heads, y'know? Like, we gotta know He's there 'cause we can think about Him.  It's like, if you can think about somethin', it's gotta exist, right?  That's kinda how he sees it. Kinda like how you know your momma's always gonna nag you, even if you ain't see her in a while. You just know she's there, even if she ain't. Anselm's sayin' God's like that.\n\nNow, Aquinas, he's a different kind of bird. He's all about logic and facts, y'know, like a good businessman. He says we can prove God exists by lookin' at the world around us, seein' how things work and figuring out there gotta be a big guy behind it all. He's got five different reasons, all based on somethin' he calls \"logical necessity.\" Like, if you got a puzzle with a bunch of pieces, and you know there's one missin', you can figure out what that piece looks like just by lookin' at the rest, right? Aquinas is sayin' it's the same with God. We can see how things work, and we know He's gotta be there.",
            "Listen up, folks! Way back in the day, a long time ago, this dude was born.  He grew up to be a prince, but he wasn't your typical prince. See, this guy, who everyone calls Buddha, decided to ditch all the fancy stuff and figure out life.  He got really smart, you know, enlightened, and started teaching folks how to be better people. That's how Buddhism started, and the most hardcore version of it is called Theravada.  \n\nThis religion's been around for like 2,500 years, and it's changed a bit since Buddha was alive.  Like, in Sri Lanka, these monks and regular folks have this water-cutting ceremony every year. Buddha never talked about that, but it's a big deal for them. That's just one example, see?  From the little stuff to the big ideas, things have shifted over time.\n\nThe monks and the regular folks who follow Buddhism have had to tweak their beliefs a little.  Sometimes it's because of outside stuff, sometimes it's because of stuff inside the religion itself. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad, like a two-sided coin.\n\nNow, let me break down some words we'll be using a lot. We got \"inside\" and \"outside\" forces. Inside comes from people who are already Buddhists, whether they're monks or not. Outside comes from people who aren't Buddhists. We also got \"hostile\" and \"benign.\" Hostile means something bad, something that wants to hurt Buddhism. Benign means it doesn't care about hurting or helping, but it might end up doing one or the other by accident.\n\nFirst things first, let's talk about what Buddhists believe. They find peace in the \"triple gem\" – Buddha himself, his teachings (the Dhamma), and the community of Buddhists (the Sangha). The Dhamma is like a big library of Buddhist texts, divided into three parts.  There's the Sutta Pitaka, which is like the main stories. Then there's the Vinaya Pitaka, which has all the rules for monks and nuns. And finally, there's the Abhidhamma Pitaka, which gets all philosophical and talks about things like \"no self,\" \"suffering,\" and \"everything changes.\"  \n\nThe Buddhists say that understanding these things is the key to stopping the cycle of death and rebirth (that's called Sansara).  By letting go of greed, anger, and delusion, you can become enlightened and free from suffering.\n\nThey also have these rules called the \"five precepts\" for regular folks. They're basically: don't kill, don't lie, don't steal, don't cheat, and don't get drunk. Monks and nuns have way more rules, of course.\n\nThe most important idea in Buddhism is the \"four noble truths.\"  First, life is full of suffering. Second, we suffer because we cling to things. Third, we can stop suffering. And fourth, there's a way to stop suffering. It's all about understanding these truths and living your life accordingly.",
            "Listen up, folks!  America and Mexico, they had a right ol' grudge match goin' on for a good long while, near 'bout 57 years, from back in 1836 all the way to 1893.  These two were like cats and dogs, always at each other's throats.  The biggest blow up was that Mexican-American War back in the 1840s.  America went in there, kicked some Mexican tail, and took Texas and all that fancy Southwest land for itself.  And they weren't just brawlin' over land, neither.  They butted heads 'bout religion, culture, and all sorts of other stuff.  It's like when your neighbor is always stealin' your lawn ornaments and talkin' smack about your grillin' skills.\n\nYou see this kinda rivalry pop up all the time between neighbors.  They're right there, sniffin' each other out, always lookin' for a reason to squabble.  America and Mexico, they're like that.  Some folks say America's always got problems with Mexico and Cuba, more'n any other country down south.  Maybe it's 'cause they're so close, always rubbin' elbows.\n\nReligion, that's another thing that got 'em riled up.  Back in the day, America didn't much like Catholicism.  Sound familiar?  It's like the Cold War, but instead of communism, it was religion.  You had Americans and Mexicans, both holdin' onto their beliefs tight, like a dog with a bone. \n\nThey went at it somethin' fierce, these two.  Border skirmishes, bandits runnin' amok, it was a mess.  But eventually, things cooled down.  Mexico got real reliant on America for stuff, and America's focus shifted from takin' land to makin' money.   They found a way to get along, after all that ruckus.",
            "Fifteen years ago, somethin' hit me outta nowhere, like a ton of bricks. I got this sickness, one I never even knew existed. Back then I was a nurse, ya know? I'd always figured that'd be my gig - everyone's gotta get sick sometime, right?  Always thought I'd be a scientist or a writer, maybe both, but I went with the safe bet. \"Nursing's a sure thing,\" folks kept sayin', \"you'll always have work.\" So, here I was, 46, single, and nothin' in the bank, suddenly unable to work. This illness, it messed me up good.  Fifteen years on disability, and I'm down to nothin'.  Barely gettin' by, every day's a fight, like I'm right back in that insecure childhood.  Life ain't solid anymore, not one bit. But there's one thing I know for sure: I couldn't have made it this far without my family and a few good friends.  Trust me, when life throws ya a curveball, you don't feel so tough.\n\nSee, life throws you curveballs, big and small. You can plan all ya want, but some things, you just can't handle alone.  \n\nFolks on the right, they talk about \"rugged individualism,\" how that built this country. But back in the day, it wasn't just grit that got 'em through. It was lookin' out for each other, sharin' what you had. Those pioneers who crossed the Rockies, they didn't make it by go'in it alone. They stuck together.\n\n\nSo, yeah, be prepared.  I am. I got a disaster kit, first aid, water purifier, even plastic sheeting for the windows if somethin' nasty ever happens. Flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, canned goods – the whole shebang.  If you got the land, grow your own food, learn to can it. Good idea, especially if you got a wood stove.  But here's the thing, don't forget about your neighbors. Get to know 'em.",
            "Alright, so ya see these fancy scientists, they're tryin' to figure out how critters change over time, right?  It's like, why do they look the way they do?  Is there some kinda rulebook for how evolution works?  Back in 1917, this fella D'Arcy Thompson said we're barely scratchin' the surface of understandin' how to talk about this stuff with numbers.  And ya know what?  He's still right!\n\nBut now, folks are usin' math to try and figure out how shells on these squirmy sea critters called mollusks grow.  It's like, take a picture of the shell at different stages, then use a computer program to see what might happen if it grew in different ways.  Kinda like buildin' a model, ya know?  They're callin' it \"mathematical modeling,\" which sounds fancy, but it's just tryin' to make sense of how things change.\n\nImagine a shell like a snail's house, but instead of brick, it's made of this hard stuff.  It spirals around and around, like a ramp windin' up.  Each turn is called a whorl, and the center is called the columella.  Some shells grow faster in some parts than others, and you can see the lines where the whorls join up.  The biggest part is the last one, called the body whorl.\n\nNow, picture a whole bunch of these shells, like a family history of snails.  Scientists look at how they're all different, how they grew, and try to figure out what made them change.  They're usin' math to help 'em see the patterns and make predictions.  It's like a big puzzle, but instead of pieces, it's shells!",
            "Listen, Indonesia's been doin' alright for the last ten years, y'know? They're gettin' closer to meetin' those fancy Millennium Development Goals, like makin' sure folks have clean water and bathrooms. But when it comes to takin' care of babies and moms, they're fallin' behind.  We gotta do better, ya hear? \n\nNow, they're braggin' about more folks havin' babies with a healthcare worker around. But lemme tell ya, a lot of 'em are just midwives, not real doctors. So what good is that when somethin' goes wrong?  And the thing about kids gettin' sick with the trots, well, they're not seein' doctors much anymore. It's sad, really. And don't even get me started on how they're treatin' moms after they give birth. Ain't right.\n\nC-sections are too low, especially in the sticks. It's like they're forgettin' folks out there in the country.  Those folks in the cities, they got it good. But the poor? They ain't got a chance. They can't afford healthcare, you see?\n\nSo what do we do? Should we just throw money at specific problems, or should we fix the whole darn healthcare system? \n\nProgrammatic stuff sounds good, like targetin' just newborn care. It's easier to manage and you see results faster. But here's the rub: if you focus too much on one thing, you forget about everything else. And everyone wants to work on the hot topic, so the rest gets neglected.  It's like a tug-of-war, ya know?",
            "Victorian books are all about the little details and they really love to talk about fancy rich people. But there are a couple of books from that time, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, that don't really follow those rules. They've got this mystery going on and some weird stuff happens, which is different from most books back then.  This mystery stuff helps us understand the characters better, like what they're really thinking and feeling.  \n\nHere's a little bit from Oliver Twist that shows what I mean:\n\n“'He felt like he was stuck between Sikes and Crackit, who were arguing and yelling.  He could even hear them talking, even though he wasn't really there. Then suddenly, he heard a gunshot, and everything around him exploded into chaos. Lights were flashing, people were screaming, and someone grabbed him and started dragging him away.  Through it all, he felt this awful, nagging pain that wouldn't go away.” (Dickens, 220)\n\nThese books use mystery and strange stuff, like dreams, to show you what's going on inside the characters' heads.  In Oliver Twist, these weird dreams tell us about Oliver's pain and how confused he is about what's happening around him. When Oliver gets shot, he has a dream about it again in Chapter 28, and it's like he's reliving the whole thing.  It shows how much pain he's in and how helpless he feels.  He can't even see who's dragging him away because he's so overwhelmed.  Oliver doesn't feel in control of anything, and it makes you wonder if someone is making bad things happen to him on purpose. This shooting shows how much control Oliver has lost.  He doesn't even try to fight back, like maybe someone has broken his spirit and made him give up.\n\n\n“Time just flew by.  One minute it was day, the next it was night again. Night felt long and scary because it was so quiet, but it also felt short because it went by so quickly.”",
            "So, lemme tell ya 'bout this kid, Adrian. Couple years back, I was workin' at this after-school thing, helpin' out little kids with their schoolwork. Now, I was pretty good with English and readin', but this kid Adrian, he was givin' me fits.  He was in third or fourth grade, somethin' like that.  Seemed like he understood some words fine, but others, he'd butcher 'em somethin' fierce. It was like he were speakin' a different language, but he talked perfect English! I was scratchin' my head, wonderin' what was goin' on.  He was Latino,  that much I knew, but his English was spot on. We went round and round, but nothin' seemed to click. Then one day, Adrian's mama came to pick him up. Now, she didn't speak a lick of English, only Spanish.  I was just learnin' a few words myself, but we managed to get by.  That's when it hit me like a ton of bricks – the kid could read fine, he just didn't know his ABCs!  Maybe it wasn't so much a problem with readin', but more like a language problem, you know? I dunno if it helped him much in the long run, but I sure hope he's doin' alright now.\n\nThis whole thing got me thinkin' 'bout how tough it can be for kids who don't speak English well.  We gotta do somethin' about it, right here in California, where there are so many different languages.  It ain't always as clear-cut as you think. Even if a kid speaks English good, readin' it can still be a real pain. \n\nSo, what's the answer? Well, Adrian's case was kinda simple – he just needed help with learnin' the alphabet and how to pronounce the letters. But for kids who barely speak English, it's a whole different ball game. There ain't just one magic bullet. We gotta try different things,  like dual language programs,  where kids learn in both English and their own language.  We gotta have more ESL classes, and maybe even some private tutors. It takes a whole lotta effort, but we gotta do it. \n\nFirst things first, let's talk about these dual language programs. They're great for all kids, not just those who speak Spanish. Lots of folks are scared of 'em, thinkin' they waste money and don't help most kids. But that's just plain wrong. If we used these programs more often, every kid would benefit.\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' every teacher has to be bilingual. That'd be crazy! But we could have special helpers, tutors, whatever ya call 'em, who speak both languages. That'd make a big difference, I tell ya!",
            "Well, lemme tell ya, from the time we're little whippersnappers, folks are always talkin' 'bout somethin' bigger than us, somethin' we can't even wrap our heads around. Some go to church, some go to temple, some just try to figure it out on their own.  Lotta folks just go with what their parents taught 'em, but some folks, they say \"Nah, ain't nothin' out there but what we can see right here.\"  Might change their minds later, but that's life, ain't it?  We all lookin' for somethin', somethin' to make sense of it all, a light in the darkness, you know what I mean?\n\nMy old man, he was a simple fella. One time, I asked him what his favorite bird was and he said a cardinal.  We were sittin' on the porch, rain beatin' down like a drum, smokin' cigarettes.  He looked out at the rain, kinda lost in thought, like he was seein' somethin' only he could see.  He'd gotten real thin, clothes hangin' off him like a sack of potatoes.  His hair was thin too, lettin' the light shine through.  He wouldn't look at me, kept his eyes on the rain.  I felt kinda lost, scared even, 'cause I didn't know how to tell him I was gonna miss him somethin' fierce. Sayin' it out loud would make it real, and that was somethin' neither of us wanted. So I just wrapped my arms around him, sat back down, scooted my chair closer, and joined him in starin' at the rain.\n\nThat was June. My dad passed away in December, just five days after my 22nd birthday. The chemo and radiation, it didn't stop the pain, just dragged it on a little longer. Doctors said he wouldn't make it past a certain point, but he hung on.  I couldn't figure out what good it did, just made things harder.  I thought, \"What kinda God lets this happen?\"  In the dead of night, I didn't even pray.  If there was a God out there, I figured he'd stopped listenin' a long time ago.\n\nI didn't wanna watch him go, so I didn't.  Couldn't stand to see the life that gave me life slip away.  I wanted to remember him for the good times, not the last days.  Besides, I knew him better than anyone else, better than his own family.  I knew he wouldn't want me there, watchin' him die.  So I curled up in bed for three days, waitin' for the news.",
            "Alright, so this \"Gothic Novel\" thing, it's kinda like a mix-up, y'know?  Like, it's old and new at the same time. This writer, Ian Watt, he called it an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New'\".  Some folks say Gothic stories ain't got no depth, while others think they're somethin' special, like they make ya feel somethin' real deep down. \n\nThis first Gothic story, \"The Castle of Otranto\" by Horace Walpole, it took bits and pieces from old stories and new ones to make somethin' brand new.  Walpole, he used stuff from old plays and then mixed it up with how folks were writin' stories back then, and called it a \"Gothic Story\".  He liked usin' stuff from the days of castles and knights, even though back then, folks thought all that was just old hat. They were all about bein' \"modern\" and fancy.\n\nBut here's the thing - Gothic stories got this mix of old and new that made 'em stick around for a long time. They're like a time capsule, y'know?  You read 'em now, and they feel old, but they also feel kinda fresh, like somethin' new.\n\nOne of the big ideas in Gothic stories is this thing called \"Chivalry\". Back in the olden days, folks were all about knights and how they were supposed to be brave and good.  Walpole, he wrote \"The Castle of Otranto\" when things were kinda messed up politically, and he thought maybe folks weren't so chivalrous anymore. So, he wrote about these knights, like this guy Frederic, to show what a real knight should be like.",

You got your customer orderin' somethin', and then it's a whole chain reaction, ya know? Raw materials gotta get gathered, stuff gets made, then shipped out to the customer.  This fella, Keith Oliver, back in '82, he came up with the name \"Supply Chain Management.\"  He figured out it's all about plannin' this whole shebang, makin' sure it runs smooth, and gettin' what folks want, quick and easy.\n\nThere's six main parts to this whole thing, kinda like the ingredients in that recipe.  You got production, supply, inventory, where to put things, how to move 'em, and information - gotta keep track of it all!\n\nProduction's the first step, the foundation, like the flour in a cake.  You gotta figure out what folks want,  what they're buyin', like lookin' at the whole market, seein' what's hot.  Then, you decide what to make, how much, where to make it, and make sure the stuff comes out right, like bakin' that cake just right.  Got to be careful, 'cause if somethin's off, it can cost ya big time. Remember when I worked at Walmart and Target? They had all these rules, like a recipe book, for everything! Made sure things ran smooth, no confusion.\n\nThen you got supply, figuring out where you're gonna get your ingredients from.  You might have different parts of your business doin' different things, like makin' the cake batter and the frosting.  You gotta decide who does what best, maybe even gettin' help from other folks, like outsourcing the frosting.  That way, you can get it done faster, cheaper, and still make a darn good cake!",

See, they don't like folks speakin' up, kinda like my old man when I was a kid. \n\nA few years back, some monks decided they'd had enough, so they started marchin', wearin' their yellow robes, and callin' it the \"Saffron Revolution.\"  It's like when I get mad about the price of beans, but instead of yellin', they're marchin' and stuff.\n\nWell, the government didn't like it much. They started crackin' down, hurtin' folks, even killin' a few.  They don't want anyone messin' with their power, just like those guys back in the day with big hats and fancy words, tryin' to tell everyone what to think.  \n\nThis ain't nothin' new, though. Seems like folks in power always wanna be in charge, no matter what. They act like they're gods, like that emperor in Rome or that fella in Japan who thought he was a phone company CEO. Even our own president, he hangs out with those guys who think they know everything.\n\nYou remember what happened in China, back in '89?  Students and folks like that, they got together, and the government, well, let's just say they didn't like it much. And then there was Rwanda, where they went after folks just 'cause they were different.\n\nListen, it all boils down to this: folks in power don't like it when you challenge 'em. They wanna be the boss, call all the shots.  It's like tryin' to tell my dog what to do, only a lot more serious.",
            "Now listen, this Duke Ellington fella, he was a real deal jazz cat. He stuck around for a long time, and that means he got real good at making his band sound good. He might not have played the piano loud in all his songs, but boy, could he write some fancy tunes!  He made music where each guy in the band could show off their skills, but he also knew how to get everyone playing together like a well-oiled machine. He could make the whole band sound like one big, amazing voice.  \n\nThis one book about music says Ellington was real good at using voices in jazz, like makin' 'em sound like instruments. He had this song called \"Creole Love Call\" where the voice ain't singin' words, it's just makin' sounds, like a real instrument.  He was all about givin' each musician a chance to shine, and this song shows that. It's slow and bluesy, and it goes through these different parts where different guys get to show off.  You got the voice talkin' back and forth with the wind instruments, then the trumpet plays a solo, all smooth and bluesy. Then the clarinet takes over, all high and fancy. It's like a conversation between all these different sounds. And then the whole band jumps in, makin' it all come together.\n\nHe did the same thing in other songs, too, like \"Hot and Bothered\" and \"It Don't Mean a Thing.\" He'd use a trumpet player and a singer, makin' their voices sound like instruments, and then he'd have a trombone player start a melody, makin' it all sound real special.  Duke Ellington, he knew how to make jazz sound good, and he did it for a long, long time.",
            "She'd always felt like somethin' was missin'. Like there was a hole inside her that nothin' could fill. This feelin' started when she was about fourteen, just gettin' into all that teenage stuff. And it was still there three years later, when she turned seventeen. By then, she'd figured out she wanted some kinda person in her life, not just some shiny thing. But she just couldn't find a boy who caught her eye. A few guys tried to court her, all awkward and clumsy, but none of 'em did nothin' for her. She spent a lot of time wonderin' why this was happenin' to her, tryin' to figure out what was makin' her so different from other girls her age. She had some ideas, but nothin' that really made sense. So she just kept livin' her life, always wonderin' about this empty space inside her.\n\nLife at home was usually pretty peaceful. Her folks were good, calm people. They never fought with each other, and rarely argued with her either. The only time they'd butt heads was when she tried to act more independent, showin' off her own spunky personality. She was the daughter of two mellow folks, but she sure brought the energy, always up for somethin' fun. Everyone liked her 'cause she was sweet and fun-lovin'.\n\nBut today wasn't a peaceful day. She was moseying from room to room, tryin' to find some inspiration, when she heard a little scream from the kitchen. It was her mom's voice, and she sounded scared.  She bolted into the kitchen, worryin' somethin' awful. \"Mom! Mom, what's wrong?\" She saw her mom on the floor, lookin' pale and in pain, whimperin', \"Ow,\" with every breath. She rushed to her mom's side and touched her gently. \"Ouch... sweety, I... need you to take me to... the hospital.\" She was speakin' in short bursts, and it was clear she was hurt bad. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where I need to pick you up.\" Her mom pointed, and her daughter, strong from all those self-defense classes, knew just what to do. She carried her mom to the car, set her down gently in the back seat, and drove like a bat outta hell.\n\nThe hospital smelled like antiseptic and sickness, but all she could think about was helpin' her mom. She rushed her inside, yellin' for a doctor. A bunch of worried faces gathered around, and someone quickly got a gurney and laid her mom down. They took her away for treatment, leavin' her daughter sittin' there, worry gnawin' at her insides.\n\nTurns out, her mom had fallen off a step stool while reachin' for a vase high up on a shelf.",
            "This here study's tryin' to show that eatin' like folks in the Mediterranean, you know, that \"Mediterranean Diet\" stuff, keeps your ticker tickin' good and helps you avoid strokes. They got this fancy name for it, \"alternate Mediterranean diet\" or somethin', but it's all about eatin' your veggies, fruits, nuts, and fish, and cuttin' back on the meat and greasy stuff. A little vino ain't gonna hurt neither.\n\nSee, folks have been sayin' for a while now that this Mediterranean eatin' helps keep you healthy, but nobody really focused on strokes before. This study followed a bunch of nurses for 20 years, ask'em what they ate every few years, and low and behold, the ones who ate the most Mediterranean, they had less heart problems and strokes. \n\nThey measured all sorts of things too, like how much they weighed, if they smoked, if they took vitamins, and if they were hoppin' around or sittin' on their duffs. Then they crunched the numbers and found that the more Mediterranean you ate, the less likely you were to have a heart attack or stroke. Pretty simple, really.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya, back in 2007, this whole country went belly up.  Jobs disappeared faster than a shot of whiskey, the housing market crashed harder than a drunk at a rodeo, and all them big fancy companies were left lookin' like a dog that ate a whole watermelon.  This mess ain't gone away yet, so we gotta ask ourselves, what in tarnation happened and how do we fix it?\n\nSee, this whole financial crisis was like a bad case of the clap, caught by them politicians makin' decisions that were about as smart as a possum in a headlock. They pushed banks and folks to give out loans like candy at Halloween, even to folks who couldn't afford a bag of chips. And these fancy folks at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, they took these loans and bundled them up into these complicated things called CDO's and CDS'. When folks started missin' their payments, the banks were left holdin' the bag, and the whole dang economy went kablooey!\n\nThis whole mess started back in '99, when President Clinton was tryin' to get re-elected. He wanted folks to like him, so he loosened up the rules on givin' out loans. It was like lettin' a bunch of toddlers loose with a whole candy store, only instead of candy, it was loans. And just like a toddler with a candy store, it all ended in a sticky mess.\n\nThen they started creatin' these newfangled mortgages, like adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and these things called CDO's. They were all fancy words for makin' things even more complicated, and it was like tangled fishing line, just makin' the whole mess worse. Folks were borrowin' money they didn't have, and the housing market got all inflated like a hot air balloon.  \n\nAnd then, just like a balloon with a hole in it, the bubble burst. All them banks that bought these fancy mortgage packages were left holdin' the bag, and the whole country went into a tailspin.",
            "Alright, listen up, ya'll. This here's about exposition, that part of a story where you gotta show off your fancy writer's skills, or else your readers might just fall asleep faster'n a catfish in a mud puddle.  I'm talkin' 'bout the stuff that makes 'em wanna slam that \"Back\" button harder'n a slammed truck door.  Even ol' Dr. Merlin, she gets frustrated with Too Much Information. Not the fun kind, mind you, the kinda info that makes ya wanna scream, \"Get to the point, ya dang story!\"\n\nNow, you folks know the golden rule, \"Show, don't tell,\" right? But even I stumble sometimes, spillin' out pages and pages of nothin' happenin', or worse, too darn much happenin'. That's exposition, my friends. It's like that little devil whisperin' in your ear, tellin' ya to get all the backstory outta the way so you can get to the good stuff.  But hold your horses! Don't go tellin' your readers every darn thing about every character's childhood, got it?\n\nExposition is like that character in a movie who just lays it all out, spoutin' info like a broken record.  Or, in a story, it's the author doin' the talkin', layin' it all on thick.\n\nLet me give ya an example. Imagine a story where the heroine met her hubby in a fancy place, got hitched in a big ol' ceremony, and then BAM! He's murdered right in front of her. You wouldn't wanna read two pages of nothin' but tellin' about that, would ya?  You'd expect somethin' more, somethin' with heart.  Show me the husband's love for his wife through his words and actions. Show me how he changed her life.  Make me feel somethin'!\n\nDon't just tell me they met, got married, and he died. Give me the juicy details!  \n\nSee, that's what exposition is all about. You gotta give your readers somethin' to sink their teeth into. Don't be stingy with the details, folks!",
            "Man, I watched a couple of news things from Columbus, Ohio the other day. \n\nFirst up was NBC 4, live this mornin' (August 13th, 2011). They had this story 'bout a fella in Ashley, Ohio who stabbed his wife real bad. Didn't say her name, but the guy's name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot, and lemme tell ya, the dude looked like a snake in a Sunday suit! They only talked about it for, like, two minutes, sayin' he stabbed her a bunch of times and got hauled off. Seemed about right to me, givin' it a couple of minutes while they figured things out.\n\nNext, they talked about this Travis Buyers, 18 years old, got shot real bad in the Sharon Woods area. No one knew who did it, SWAT was on the case. I gotta say, they didn't spend much time on this one. You know why? I bet it's 'cause this fella was black, or maybe he lived in a black neighborhood. It's like the news forgets folks like that got problems too. If a white kid got hurt, they'd be all over it, but if it's a black person, they barely even mention it. \n\nThen they talked about a bullet hole in one of them Med-Flight helicopters. Said it was a .22 from a rifle. They were offerin' five grand for any tips that led to the jerk who shot it.\n\nThey threw in a quickie about the rain comin' this weekend, said it'd be in the eighties, yadda yadda. Just teasin' ya to keep watchin', I guess.\n\nThey also had this story about a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road. They said the robber was a dark-skinned black man, wearin' a hoodie, about six feet tall and 150 pounds. Seemed kinda weird to me how much they hammered on about him bein' black.\n\nAnd finally, they talked about this Rene Rodriguez, a drug dealer from Texas who got caught slingin' weed to Ohio. He got 300 months, which is 25 years, right?  They kept sayin' 300 months, like it was supposed to sound scarier.  And they mentioned he was Hispanic, but what does that have to do with anything?",
            "Brothers, man, they got this bond, you know? Like, it's unbreakable, like somethin' you can't explain. It's got all kinds of stuff in it, love, yeah, but also pride, jealousy, even mean stuff sometimes. You know, brothers, they get each other, more than anybody else. It's like lookin' in a mirror, seein' yourself but somehow different, you know? And when things get tough, that bond, it really shows its true colors, good or bad.  It ain't always pretty, but it's real.  This story, \"The Scarlet Ibis\", it's all about that, about these two brothers and all the crazy feelings they got for each other.\n\nThey're runnin' around this beautiful place, but they're on a trip that ain't gonna end well. There's this bitter disappointment, like, they're both tryin' so hard but it ain't workin' out. Then there's this pride, this big ol' mess of pride, and it all comes to a head. In the end, only one brother makes it out alive.  \n\nThe story tells you about these emotions through the main guy, Doodle, and how he acts.  And it also tells you about how he sees the world, which is important 'cause that shapes how he acts.  It's all tied together, see?\n\n\nThe main guy, he's all about that pride, from the start. He wants a brother who can keep up with him, you know, someone to do all these cool things with. But Doodle, he's weak, he can't do any of that.  The main guy, he gets mad, even thinks about smotherin' the little kid. Can you believe that? But then Doodle smiles at him, and bam! All the anger melts away.  See, deep down, he loves his brother.",
            "Ya know, the brain, it's a heck of a thing.  Folks used to say it was like a wax tablet, then a piece of paper, then a book. Now they say it's like a computer. But, lemme tell ya, those are just fancy words for somethin' complicated. \n\nSee, information comes in through your senses - touch, sound, sight, all that jazz. Your brain takes that stuff and messes with it, like a recipe.  First, it breaks it down, little by little, like lookin' at a box.  Then, it puts it all back together, faster than you can say \"jack rabbit.\"  It's like, if you see a box, your brain says, \"Hey, that's a box!\"  But it's not just seein' the box, it's knowin' it's a box, not a hole.\n\nNow, your brain ain't just a sponge soakin' up everything. It's got a filter, like a bouncer at a club.  It says, \"Hey, this is important, pay attention!\" and \"Nah, this ain't worth your time.\"  Like, you see a bunch of grass, but you don't notice each blade. But if your name gets called out in a crowd, boom, you hear it! \n\nThe brain also got this memory thing goin' on. It stores stuff, like a big ol' warehouse.  It's got different rooms for different kinds of stuff - short-term, long-term, all that.  And it remembers by makin' connections, like a spider web.  So when you remember somethin', it's like followin' a thread through the web.",
            "Alright, so this Huxley fella, he's givin' us the lowdown on how technology and big ol' corporations are gonna mess us all up someday. He writes this book, \"Brave New World,\" and it's a real downer.  Everyone in this world is all about being part of the crowd and gettin' their instant gratification fix.  They don't care about bein' individuals, 'cause the big boss man, the World Controller, tells 'em what to think and do. \n\nHuxley's kinda like a Marxist, see? He sees how these rich folks are usin' this system to keep the rest of us dumb and happy, just workin' and spendin' all the time. He calls it \"false consciousness.\"  It's like they're puttin' a blindfold on us so we don't see how the real world works.  We're all just pawns in their game, chasin' after the next shiny thing, and they're siphonin' off all the dough.\n\nThese folks in the book, they got these different classes, like the Deltas, Gammas, and all that.  They're all conditioned from birth to be happy with their lot in life,  even if it means they're bein' used.  They don't even know they're bein' used!\n\nAnd the worst part is, the people at the top, the Alphas and Betas, they know what's goin' on, but they don't care. They just keep on enjoyin' their fancy lives, leavin' the rest of us to rot.\n\nHuxley even shows how this system crushes real human connection. Nobody in this world has any real feelings, no deep thoughts, nothin'.  They're just talkin' about how good lookin' the chicks are or how many times they slept with 'em. It's all just surface stuff.  \n\nIt's like Huxley's sayin', if we keep lettin' technology and big corporations run our lives, we're gonna lose our humanity. We'll become nothin' more than robots, followin' orders and spendin' all our time on empty pleasures.",
            "Been at this University Park place for a couple years now, almost three.  Gotta say, getting around this campus is a real pain in the neck. Back when I was livin' in  East Halls, which is like, way outta the way,  getting to classes down near Willard building felt like a cross-country trek. Sometimes, especially when the weather was crappier than a week-old burger, it took me a good 25 minutes just to walk there. Talked to an old-timer who graduated not too long ago, and he told me how they used to have all this empty space between East Halls and the rest of campus. Now, they've crammed in all these new buildings, sports fields, and apartments. With all the changes, it's getting harder and harder to get around.  What's the solution? Bikes, man!  \n\nHad a buddy tell me the other day how he'd gotten back into ridin' bikes. Said it was the only way to get around, and he was glad he'd started again.  You know, bikes are good for ya, plus they're the fastest way to get from here to there. You can ride a bike with just some oatmeal in your belly and cover 30 miles without breaking a sweat. I live off campus now, just as far from the center of campus as some of those dorms.  Best thing I did this year was buy myself a bike.  \n\nMy classes are in Thomas building, which is a good 25-minute walk from my place. But on my bike? Five minutes, tops!  The only problem is  Pollock Road ain't always the safest route. It's a straight shot, but there are times when it's a real pain to ride.  Walkin' ain't bad, but I ain't got the time. If I didn't have my bike, I'd be walkin'  to Thomas every day, which would be a good 30-40 minutes each way. That's over two and a half hours a week just walkin' to class! Add to that all the other places I gotta go, and it'd be a real time suck."
