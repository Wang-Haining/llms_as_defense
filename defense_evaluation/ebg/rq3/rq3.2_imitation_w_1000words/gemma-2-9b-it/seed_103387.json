            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Now listen here, this German empire thing, it was a real mixed bag.  Sure, they were meanies in some places, especially to those Ovaherero and Nama folks in South West Africa. That was just plain wrong. But you gotta remember, this ain't no one-size-fits-all story.  Like my buddy who's a little slow, each of their colonies was different, just like people. \n\nThey had some fancy schools in places like East Africa, even when the Brits took over they found a bunch of smart Africans already knowin' their stuff.  But down in South West Africa, it was a whole different tune.\n\nThey didn't care much for teachin' the locals there.  They let the church folks handle it, and those church folks didn't have much money. They did alright by the white folks though, built 'em their own schools and kept a close eye on the church schools too.  \n\nThat messed things up for South West Africa.  While other places were full of smart Africans, South West Africa was left behind.  They didn't get much teachin', most folks couldn't read or write.  There's a lotta reasons for this, gotta dig deep to figure it out.  I'm talkin' about the folks who moved there, the bosses in charge, and the whole economy.\n\nThere's been a lot of talk about this, folks have been writin' about it for years. Mostly in German, back when it was all goin' down.  They mainly just told what schools were like in each place.\n\nLater on, folks in English started comparin' schools all over the place and gettin' into the nitty-gritty of how they worked.  They found out it wasn't all the same, that's for sure.\n\nOne fella, Cohen, he wrote about South West Africa and East Africa. He says that South West Africa had a lot more white folks livin' there, and that's why the schools were so different.\n\nSouth West Africa was a pretty nice place to live, even if it was mostly desert.  There were a lot more white folks there than anywhere else they had colonies.",
            "Man, lemme tell ya, tryin' to figure out what all the different kinds of popular music are is like tryin' to herd cats! You got your rock, your country, your rap, your jazz, heck, even folk music, and each one of 'em has got a whole bunch of little sub-genres sprouted up like weeds. \n\nBut lemme tell ya, heavy metal, that's a whole 'nother ball game! That music's been around for like 40 years, and it's wilder than a bunch of coyotes in a chicken coop. It's got all these different moods, mostly on the darker side, but that's part of what makes it so cool.  \n\nIt's like a big ol' family reunion, with all these different branches and cousins. You got your classic metal, your thrash, your death metal, your doom metal, and a whole bunch more I can't even keep track of. It's like every time you think you've got it figured out, someone comes along and throws a wrench in the works. \n\nNow, you gotta understand, heavy metal ain't just about the music. It's a whole way of life, a movement, if you will. It's about bein' loud, bein' proud, and not bein' afraid to show your true colors. It's about  embracin' the darkness, the chaos, the whole nine yards.\n\nAnd yeah, some folks might say it's all about drugs and violence, and maybe there's a little truth to that. But there's more to it than that, too. It's about expressin' yourself, about findin' your voice, about bein' part of somethin' bigger than yourself. \n\nSo, if you wanna understand heavy metal, you gotta go beyond the surface. You gotta dig deep into the music, into the lyrics, into the heart of the movement. You gotta understand what it means to be a metalhead, to embrace the darkness, to live life on your own terms.",
            "Before them fancy Surrealist painters started makin' their weird dream pictures, this fella Henri Rousseau was busy dreamin' his own dreams, both in his head and on canvas. See, back in 1910, he painted this picture called \"The Dream,\" and it ain't just some lady lookin' at pretty stuff in a dream. It's kinda like Rousseau himself, pourin' his heart out about what he wanted as a painter. This guy, he dreamed big - he wanted folks to notice his art, to like it, to say good things about it. But here's the catch: he was torn. He wanted to be accepted by all the fancy art folks, but he also wanted to be himself, ya know? It was like he had a choice: play by their rules or stick to his own guns. And \"The Dream,\" well, that's him wrestle'n with that choice. \n\nNow, to understand this painting, ya gotta know a little about Rousseau's life. He wasn't born with a silver spoon, wasn't no art prodigy. He worked for the government, collectin' tolls, all while paintin' on the side. Didn't have no formal art training, nothin' fancy like that.  But he was a dreamer, and after his wife and kids passed away, paintin' became his way to escape, to find somethin' new.\n\nHe wanted to be accepted by the art world, and I don't blame him. He started later in life than most, and there were a bunch of other talented artists makin' a name for themselves. He even worked around the same time as Matisse, but they were different cats. Matisse was all about bein' original, breakin' the rules, while Rousseau just wanted to paint somethin' good enough to get noticed.",
            "Lotsa brainy folks think thinkin' 'bout right and wrong is kinda like thinkin' 'bout pretty things - they go together.  You know, like that fella Keats said, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" We learn a lot by goin' to school or doin' stuff, but  we just kinda *get* right and wrong and pretty things, ya know?\n\nIt's not like we're taught how to like good art or do good deeds, it's more like we try to figure out *why* stuff's good or pretty. Like, when we talk about a painting, we might talk about colors and stuff, but that don't really tell ya why it's so dang good.  It's like, \"There's just somethin' about it,\" ya know?  Same with right and wrong - we can talk 'bout rules all day, but it's more than just followin' the rules. \n\nIt's like that writer Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say somethin' that can't be said any other way.\"  No matter how much we talk 'bout a book or a painting, there's always somethin' more to it, somethin' special.  That's what makes 'em so powerful. It's like that \"je ne sais quoi\"  -  that somethin' special that ya can't put your finger on. \n\nI think we feel right and wrong deep down inside, in a way that we can't really explain. It's like a gut feelin'. And that's why art and right and wrong are so connected - they both touch us in a way that words can't always explain.",
            "Germany today is a real powerhouse, a country that's come together with its own unique culture. You can feel it everywhere, from the fancy city of München nestled in the Alps all the way to Kiel by the Baltic Sea. Then there's Köln on the Rhine River, Dresden in Saxony by the Elbe –  it's a blend of history and tradition that makes Germany so special.  It's no surprise that this awesome country has roots from all sorts of different tribes and groups. \n\nThey call the land where the Germans live \"Germania\".  But where did that name come from?  Well, everyone's got their own theory. This guy Tacitus, a writer back in the day, said it came from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians. He figured they were called \"Germans\" before they crossed the Rhine and fought with the Gauls. Then there's Julius Caesar, who used the word \"Germanus\" in his writings about the Gallic Wars. He was fighting the Gauls and these Germanic tribes who kept sneaking across the Rhine. Caesar used the word to tell the difference between who he had conquered (the Gauls) and who he hadn't. Some folks think the Gauls gave him the word, others say it came from a spear the Germans used in battle called a \"ger\".  Maybe it even comes from an old Irish word for \"shout\" because, you know, Germans are known for being loud! \n\nTacitus wrote a book about the origins of the Germans called \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" way back in 98 AD.  He thought the Germans were original folks, not mixed with other races.  He even said, “Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?”\n\nAnd you know who wouldn't go to Germania? The Romans! They'd march in for goods and fight a few battles, but mostly they stayed home in their big empire. So the Germanic tribes hung out on the edges of the Roman world in the 1st century, trading stuff they got from the land and even serving in the Roman army.",
            "Man, I was lookin' at this stuff, all messed up and stuff.  Didn't even know what to think, ya know?  Just lookin' at it, like it was some kinda puzzle I couldn't solve. My mind was runnin', but nothin' was clickin'. It was like watchin' a movie, but I didn't understand the story.\n\nOnce, this artist buddy told me about this book, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" Said it could teach ya how to draw anything.  \n\nHe said if you want to draw somethin' real good, you gotta break it down. Like, if you see a whole room,  just focus on one thing, like a bowl of fruit.  It's like takin' a picture and makin' it smaller, easier to understand.\n\nBut this stuff I was lookin' at, it was too much. I felt like I was staring at somethin' outta this world. Like, Picasso had his blue period, Monet loved flowers, and all those fancy Italian painters, they used every color in the book. I figured, if I was gonna be an artist, I gotta start somewhere. And this, right here, this was my start. My \"Masterpiece in Brown.\"  \n\nI reached out, my hand tremblin' a little, like I was holdin' a magic wand. My mind was sayin' one thing, but my body was doin' somethin' else. The water swirled, lookin' all calm and peaceful. Then, somethin' happened. The brown stuff, it wouldn't budge. It was stuck like glue.\n\nMy heart was beatin' faster now. This wasn't what I had in mind.  I was wearin' this stupid tie, my feet felt funny, and all I could think about was this mess. I was like a waiter at a fancy restaurant, but instead of servin' food, I was servin' up...well, you know.  I took a deep breath, grabbed the mop, and got to work.  I swear, it felt like I was preparin' for a Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya, these young whippersnappers are dyin' behind the wheel somethin' fierce! It's like a recipe for disaster, ya know?  The big brains over at the National Institutes of Health say that their brains ain't quite cooked yet for all the craziness of drivin'. And let's face it, they ain't got much experience either.  That lack of know-how leads to a whole heap of accidents, rollovers, speedin', and even drivin' off the road!\n\nNow, these kids, they love cruisin' around with their buddies, and we all know it.  A bunch of 'em piled in a car is like a recipe for trouble. These brainiacs down in California did a study showin' just how much worse things get when the passenger's a peer.  \n\nThey've tried to fix this by givin' young'uns these temporary licenses that put limits on when they can drive and who they can have in the car. But that's just a band-aid on a bullet hole, if ya ask me.\n\nThe real problem is that these young drivers, statistically speakin', ain't cut out for the road yet.  This fella Zuckerman, a psychologist, says even 18's too young for a real license.  He's done all sorts of research showin' that young folks, 19 and under, just crave that thrill, that rush.  Waitin' a bit longer, until they calm down a bit, might be a good idea.\n\nWe keep givin' 'em licenses, we're gonna see more and more young folks gettin' hurt. With all those baby boomers' kids turnin' 16 soon, we're lookin' at a real catastrophe on the roads.  \n\nHere's what we gotta do:  Keep teachin' 'em in school, but no one under 18 gets behind the wheel. We can still have those learner's permits and all that, and they gotta get their hours in with a grown-up.  California, they already do 6 hours of drivin' with an instructor and 50 hours with a parent or somethin'.\n\nWe need a nationwide law on this, somethin' that protects everyone.  It ain't a new idea, but it's a darn good one.",
            "Listen, I was lookin' at these old Edison movies, you know, the ones from way back in the day,  like before World War I. There were fifteen of these \"trick\" movies, and they were all about pullin' the wool over your eyes. They use some fancy cuttin' and whatnot to make things look like magic. I tried to figure out how these movies worked, ya know, like the rules of the game. Most of 'em are pretty basic, like they were filmed on a stage. The camera never moves, it just sits there like it's watchin' a play. And the actors, they only move back and forth, never towards or away from the camera. Like somethin' outta  those old vaudeville shows.  They even stick to these long shots, like you're way back in the audience. No close-ups, not even once.  \n\nAnd the whole thing is like one big trick, ya see? Each trick is like one whole movie, only a minute or so long. They just gotta get the trick done quick, like a magic show. But don't let that fool ya, sometimes they'll stitch together a bunch of little shots to make it look like somethin' disappeared or somethin'. Watch this one, \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" from way back in 1895.  It looks like one shot, but if you look real close, you'll see where they switch things out.  Sneaky, huh?",
            "Now listen here folks, this John Taylor fella, he was a real firebrand when it came to bein' a Republican.  Worked the land himself,  but that didn't stop him from talkin' up his beliefs, loud and clear.  He was all about folks being free to do their own thing, especially when it came to runnin' their own farms.  That's what drove his whole outlook on government, see?  He figured  the government was best when it kept its nose out of folks' business and let 'em get on with their lives.\n\nJohn Taylor, he thought America had a chance to build somethin' real special, somethin' that hadn't been done before.  He felt like we were startin' fresh, with no old ways holdin' us back.  He believed folks were born with rights, you know,  rights that couldn't be messed with by the government.  He figured if you take away one right,  they all start to crumble.\n\nTo make this dream work, Taylor thought the government had to be built right. He knew folks are good and bad, so the government had to keep both sides in check.  He was a straight shooter,  believed there was right and wrong,  and he thought the government should stick to what's right.  He felt a good government protects your property, helps farmers, and doesn't get too big for its britches.  He believed folks would always look out for themselves, but that's not always a bad thing if it helps the whole country.  \n\nTaylor, like a lot of his Republican buddies, believed the Constitution should be read exactly as it was written.  He didn't want the government gettin' too powerful,  costin' too much money,  or bossin' folks around.  But he also knew you gotta understand what the folks who wrote it meant,  not just read the words on the page.  He even thought the Declaration of Independence was more important 'cause it talked about states bein' independent, not just one big country.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya, seein' that chart in Figure 17, it was like  someone pulled the plug on those commuter logs in the third month.  Kinda bummed me out,  I gotta say.  Hard to figure out why folks stopped fillin' 'em out.  You know, up here in New England, when winter hits, folks ain't walkin' or bikin' much anymore.  That could explain some of it, I reckon.  December's also when the semester's endin' and everyone's runnin' around tryin' to finish their work, get their grades, and all that jazz.  Maybe the log just slipped their minds.  And then there's the holidays, man.  It's a whole month long break for students and teachers, nobody's even on campus most of the time!  Then school starts back up in January, and that might explain why there weren't many logs then either.  But nothin' explains why February was so slow.\n\nI guess folks get all excited about new projects at first, then the fire dies down, ya know?  So we tried to crank things up again with a special \"Carpool Challenge Week\" in March, and that brought the logs back up a bit.  We learned that keepin' folks engaged is tough, especially with all the holidays and breaks in academia. \n\nAnother thing, folks love their cars.  It's just part of our American way of life.  So, we gotta give 'em somethin' good to switch over, ya know?  We gave away all sorts of prizes, gift cards to restaurants, coffee shops, massage places, even the bookstore.  I wonder though, if we'd given away some real big prizes, like a new bike, a hybrid car, or even an electric one, would that've gotten more folks involved?  Maybe it would've stopped that dip in the logs.  \n\nWe kept the prizes the same throughout the whole project.  But what if we'd upped the ante?  Maybe if we'd announced some fancy bikes in December, and then a hybrid or electric car in January, folks would've been more motivated to log their commutes.",
            "Well shoot, lemme tell ya 'bout these fancy things called ETFs. They're kinda like those index funds, but you can buy 'em and sell 'em like regular ol' stocks. Think of it like this: you want to own a piece of the whole stock market, but you don't wanna pick out each stock yourself. An ETF does that for ya, like a big ol' basket of stocks all wrapped up in one.\n\nThey're cheaper than those mutual funds, and you can buy just a single share, not like some of them funds where you gotta put down a whole truckload of cash.  But here's the kicker: you gotta pay a fee every time you buy or sell, just like with regular stocks.\n\nNow, there's all sorts of ETFs out there, trackin' different things, like the whole market, certain industries, even somethin' called \"hot dogs\" if you believe it! This here one, IHF, is trackin' a bunch of different companies, but lemme tell ya, most of it's tied up in just ten of 'em.\n\nSo I figured, why not just buy those ten companies straight up? See if it's better than buyin' the whole ETF. Turns out, usin' just those ten companies, I might get a better return, and it might even be a little less risky. \n\nNow, I ain't no fancy Wall Street fella, but I reckon it's always good to double-check the numbers.  See if what they're sayin' about diversification and all that jazz is really true.",
            "So, Poe thought this poem, \"Dream-Land\", was pretty darn good. You see, he uses this word \"Thulé\" twice in it, and this guy named Mabbott figured out that Poe got it from Virgil. Virgil, way back when, used \"Thulé\" to talk about an island way up north, like the edge of the world back then. Now, Virgil probably used it first, but Poe was a big fan of German writers, ya know?\n\nOne of these German fellas, Goethe, wrote this poem called \"The King of Thulé\". It's about a king who loses his wife and goes totally bonkers, drinking like crazy and moping around. He ends up giving away all his stuff and throwing himself off a cliff. Sound familiar?  Some smart guy, Karl J. Arndt, said Poe's poem and Goethe's are kinda alike, like Poe was copying him. \n\nGoethe was a big deal back in the day, wrote this famous play called \"Faust\", the first part came out in 1808 and the second one when he died in 1832.  And in the second part of \"Faust\", there's this short poem called \"The King of Thulé\", which is about that same sad king who throws himself off a cliff.  Poe used \"Thulé\" twice in his poems, once in \"Dream-Land\" and once in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\".  Some folks say these two poems, Poe's and Goethe's, they kinda go together. Poe's poem is about this dark and lonely place, haunted by dead friends, just like Goethe's king.\n\nPoe liked Tennyson, and Goethe was a big deal even back then. Poe probably knew about him because everybody was talking about him.",
            "So, lemme ask ya somethin'. This gal, Jennifer, she tripped and fell in a grocery store because some dang applesauce was spilled on the floor. Now, the store manager, this Martin fella, knew about the spill twice before Jennifer went down. But he was too busy eatin' his dinner to clean it up for half an hour! Can Jennifer sue for extra money, ya know, like punishin' the store for bein' so dang careless? \n\nWell, the judge ain't gonna just toss her claim out the window right away.  To get that extra money, Jennifer gotta prove that Martin knew darn well folks could get hurt from that spill, but he just didn't care. She also gotta show he was a real jerk about it.\n\nJennifer can say that Martin shoulda known better 'cause folks had been slipin' and fallin' on spills all year!  Even though he knew this, he still ignored the problem.\n\nNow, sayin' Martin was a real bad apple might be a stretch, but it ain't outta line, ya know?  Six folks had already busted their tails fallin' in that store that year!\n\nHere's the story: This employee, Rich, told Martin about the applesauce spill at 5 pm. Martin said he was on break and didn't wanna deal with it. Then another worker, Mary, told Martin about the spill again at 5:15 pm, but he said the same thing.  At 5:30 pm, Jennifer went down and hurt her back somethin' fierce!\n\nNow, Jennifer's sayin' D&D should pay for her injuries, both for the hurtin' she done and for bein' so dang negligent.  And we gotta figure out if we should ask the judge to throw out the part about punative damages.\n\nSee, in California, you can get extra money if a company acts real bad, even if there ain't no contract involved. They gotta have done somethin' mean, like cheat folks or act with malice.  Malice means they either wanted to hurt folks or they were so dang reckless that they knew they were gonna hurt someone, but didn't care. That's what Jennifer's tryin' to prove with Martin and that applesauce.",
            "So, lemme tell ya somethin'. I took this Islam class, like four years ago, at CBC. One thing we argued about a lot was if Islam was a bad religion, ya know? And now, more than ever, that question feels important. Think about it, after 9/11, the news went from sayin' Islam was bad to sayin' it's totally cool. I mean, could you imagine back in 2001 havin' a prez candidate named Barack Obama, with that Muslim family history? Not a chance!\n\nNow, this book about Muhammad, the prophet, it got me thinkin'. I always thought Muhammad was a kinda tough guy, ya know, conquerin' tribes and makin' 'em turn Muslim. But this book paints him as this martyr, misunderstood, even humble. Like, people came to him on their own, seein' the truth in his words. Kinda makes ya wonder, huh?\n\nAnd listen, this book makes Muhammad sound a lot like Jesus. Take that story about him turnin' a little mutton and milk into enough for forty guys. It's like they're tryin' to make Muhammad look like some kinda miracle worker, just like Jesus. It's kinda sneaky, ya know? Like they're tryin' to steal Jesus' thunder!\n\nThey also got these stories about how people converted to Islam all on their own. But a lot of 'em come from second-hand stories, like \"So-and-so told me, who heard it from so-and-so.\" That kinda stuff makes it sound fishy to me.\n\nBut the worst part is, they try to make Muhammad out to be this perfect man, humble and wise. But history says somethin' different. I gotta wonder if Muslims today even know the real story about how Muhammad got so powerful.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya somethin'.  You see, the way folks been talkin' 'bout Jesus these days ain't nothin' like what he was really preachin'. It's like they got off track, ya know?  Seems like the world's gettin' more open-minded,  makin' progress and all that.  But you still got those old-timers, stuck in their ways,  refusin' to budge.  But they ain't gonna change nothin'. \n\nNow, I reckon folks are gonna start thinkin' 'bout the real Jesus, what he truly meant. They're gonna want to peel back all the layers of stuff that got added over the years. It might take a while, maybe even a long time, but it'll happen.  We're talkin' a whole turnaround, like turnin' back the clock.\n\nFolks are gonna start followin' Jesus like it's the good old days, just his words, nothin' else. The church might still be there, leadin' the way, but it won't be the same.  Everyone's gonna be thinkin' alike, with the same beliefs and doin' things the same way.  \n\nHistory's full of these big changes. Remember when Christians were gettin' persecuted by the Romans?  Then they turned around and became Christians themselves!  Same thing happened here in our country, went from slavery to black folks leadin' the way. \n\nThis whole thing, it's gonna happen in the church too, goin' back to the roots, forgettin' all the extra stuff. And it's gonna be like readin' Jesus' words in a new way, not takin' everything so literally.\n\nSo, what happened since Jesus walked the earth?  Well, it all started with Judaism, the foundation of Christianity.  They believed in only one God, had their scriptures, the whole shebang.  But even then, they weren't all on the same page, split into different groups, like the Sadducees, Pharisees, and those crazy Zealots.",
            "Look, I reckon \"The Jungle\" shows folks are pretty darn greedy, you know? Deep down, they just wanna look out for number one, make their own lives easier, and don't give a hoot about nobody else, especially not the little guy. The book makes that plain as day. \n\nTake them factory owners and bosses, for instance. All they care about is makin' their factories big and fancy, makin' as much dough as they can. They don't give a lick about anyone gettin' hurt or messed up along the way.\n\nUpton Sinclair, he writes about how the factories are like these big, ugly beasts, all black and smokin', spewin' out pollution like it's nothin'. He's tryin' to show how these factory owners just don't care about the people or the animals, just about makin' money. They don't care about the smoke chokin' the air or the mess they're makin' with all the animal waste runnin' around.\n\nAnd the bosses, they don't care about their workers neither. They'll squeeze every penny they can out of 'em, work 'em till they drop, and then lay 'em off without a second thought. Back then, there weren't no laws protectin' workers, so they could get away with anything. It was a dog-eat-dog world, and the workers were the ones gettin' eaten.\n\nSinclair says the workers were like slaves, treated worse than dirt. They had no say in nothin', no way to fight back. They were stuck in this awful system, workin' themselves to the bone just to survive.",
            "Y'all ever notice how some folks try to make you feel a certain way 'bout things? Like, they wanna pump you up or make you all sad and mopey?  Well, F. Scott Fitzgerald, that fella who wrote \"The Great Gatsby,\" he's a real master at that. He uses all sorts of tricks, like pairing words together that don't usually go together, kinda like sayin' \"purple polka-dotted toaster\" - it just makes ya stop and think, ya know? And he's real good at usin' symbols too, like colors.  He takes a color, gives it a meaning, then uses it again and again to make ya think of that same feelin'. \n\nHe's got this whole thing goin' on with colors like gold, green, white, and red.  But the ones he uses the most are white and gray - 'specially white and gray.  He uses 'em to show that somethin' ain't nothin' special, like a bunch of folks all wearin' the same clothes.\n\nSee, white for Fitzgerald means somethin' kinda fancy and nice, like Daisy, she's always in white, even when she's dressin' up for Gatsby's big parties.   But gray, well, that's more like somethin' old and faded, like them big apartment buildings Nick sees in the city.  He uses these colors to show how folks are all the same, like they're parts of a big ol' machine.\n\nThen, when Fitzgerald wants ya to think somethin' ain't important, he uses white and gray for it. He does this with Daisy, for example. After a while, when he keeps describin' her in these colors, she starts to seem less like a person and more like somethin' to be owned, like a fancy car or a piece of jewelry.\n\nSo, Fitzgerald's playin' with colors to make ya feel somethin' specific, like Daisy ain't just a woman, but somethin' more like an idea - somethin' predictable and kinda empty.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya about this little piece of land in San Diego.  It's a real gem.  Sun's always shinin', folks grow all sorts of good eatin' there – tomatoes, citrus, you name it.  Even got folks growin' stuff organic,  they're sellin' it faster than a politician promises a tax cut!\n\nNow, this here land, it's got a history,  been around since way back when the Native Americans lived here.  Then came the cowboys and folks cuttin' wood,  they used it for grazin' and choppin' wood.\n\nSo, I was thinkin', what if someone wanted to turn this land back into a farm,  but somethin' special,  organic and good for the critters too?  Well, it ain't gonna be cheap,  takes more work than just throwin' chemicals around.  But, there's all sorts of programs to help folks out,  like hand outs from the government.\n\nThey got this big plan for keepin' all the critters alive,  even the rare ones.  Seems like a lotta work,  plantin' all sorts of stuff to keep the animals happy,  but it's good for the land.\n\nNow, this organic farm I found nearby,  they're doin' it right.  They're makin' money and keepin' the wildlife happy.  It shows ya,  you can do good and make a buck at the same time.",
            "Listen up, folks! You know how everyone's always talkin' 'bout culture? Well, lemme tell ya, it ain't just some fancy word.  It's like, the way folks do things, their beliefs, y'know?  \n\nNow, don't go thinkin' all Russians are stubborn or all Japanese are nice. That's just plain wrong!  Culture ain't a one-size-fits-all kinda thing. It's more like, understandin' why people do what they do, especially when you're tryin' to work somethin' out with 'em.\n\nWhen you meet folks from a different place, it's kinda like lookin' in a mirror, seein' yourself a little bit, but different. You gotta learn their ways, like their history and what makes 'em tick.\n\nDon't go judgin' 'em or tryin' to change 'em, just respect their ways and work with 'em.  Especially if you're the one needin' somethin' from 'em.  Treat 'em right, be polite, and you'll get further than tryin' to bulldoze your way through.\n\nNow, culture ain't just 'bout countries, either. It's about companies too. Some places work hard, others take it easy. Some got fancy dress codes, others are more casual. It's all part of the culture.\n\nValues are even more important, 'cause they tell you why folks do what they do. If they value respect, you gotta be respectful.  If they're all about gettin' a good deal, you gotta be ready to haggle.\n\nSo, before you sit down at the table, do your homework. Learn about the folks you're dealin' with, their culture, their values.  And remember, treat 'em right, and you'll be halfway there.",
            "Alright, so these two fellas, St. Anselm and St. Thomas, both think God exists.  They both gotta prove it though, right? So, let's just assume they're both right about God, the God from the Bible, 'cause that's what they're talkin' about.\n\nNow, Anselm, he's all about faith, you know? He says you gotta look inside yourself to find God. He's sayin' that since we can even think about God, He must be real. It's kinda like knowin' you need a missing piece to a puzzle, even if you can't see it yet. Anselm says God's like that missing piece, we just know He's there.\n\nBut Thomas, he's a different breed. He wants to prove God with facts, ya know, stuff you can see and touch. He says there are five good reasons why God has to exist, like how everything changes, how things have a cause, and how there are different levels of good and bad. He's sayin' it's all just plain logic, like math, that proves God is real.\n\nSo, both these guys make some good points, but neither one really nails it down for me. They both kinda take a shortcut, ya know? Anselm just assumes we know God's there, and Thomas tries to prove it with logic, but that ain't always foolproof.",
            "So there was this prince, way back in the day, like way back, fifth or sixth century BCE,  who turned into this big deal, Buddha.  He was all about ditching the fancy life and figuring things out, and what he learned became Buddhism.  Now, this Buddhism thing, it's been around for like 2,500 years, and it ain't the same as when Buddha was kickin' around.  Take Sri Lanka, for instance, they got this water-cutting ceremony every year. Monks and regular folks do it, and it's kinda important to them, even though Buddha never mentioned nothin' about it.  See, Buddhism has changed a lot, from the little stuff to the big ideas.  All the monks and regular folks, they've had to tweak their beliefs over time.  Why? Well, things happen, both good and bad, from inside and outside the religion.\n\nLet's get this straight, we're gonna be talkin' about \"inside\" and \"outside,\" \"good\" and \"bad,\" ya know, like that.  Inside stuff comes from folks who are already Buddhists, doesn't matter if they're monks or not.  Outside stuff comes from folks who ain't Buddhists.  Anything that hurts Buddhism is bad, like someone tryin' to tear it down.  And anything that doesn't really care, well, that's neutral, good or bad, depends on the outcome.\n\nNow, let's talk about what Buddhists believe. They go for the triple gem: Buddha, the teachings, and the community.  The teachings are all in these books called the Tripitaka:  The Sutta Pitaka has Buddha's talks, the Vinaya Pitaka has the rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka has the deep stuff about how things work. They talk about no soul (Anatta), life is suffering (Dukkha), and everything changes (Anicca).  Gotta understand these things to get outta the cycle of death and rebirth (Sansara).  And when you get outta that cycle, you get rid of desire (lobha), hate (dosa), and delusion (moha), and become enlightened.  The Vinaya Pitaka tells you how to live. Lay folks have five rules, like don't kill, don't lie, don't steal, and so on. Monks have a whole bunch more rules to follow.\n\nThe big idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. First, life is suffering (Dukkha). Second, suffering comes from wanting things (attachment). Third, suffering can stop. Fourth, there's a way to stop suffering.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya, the US and Mexico, they used to be at each other's throats somethin' fierce! Went on for a good 57 years, from way back in 1836 to 1893.  You know, kinda like those feuds ya hear about down south, but on a bigger scale. The biggest fight was back in 1846, the Mexican-American War.  We jumped on Mexico and took their land, Texas and the Southwest, somethin' fierce!  They had a few other run-ins along the way, but finally calmed down just before the First World War.\n\nSee, it all started because these two countries had some real differences,  like religion, culture, how things were done - you know, the usual stuff. And they both wanted the same stuff, makin' things even hotter. Kinda like how neighbors sometimes fight over the fence line.\n\nIt ain't just the US and Mexico either. Lots of countries that share a border end up buttin' heads.  They're close, which means they're always gettin' in each other's way.  Heck, some folks say the US has more problems with Mexico and Cuba than any other country in Latin America.\n\nReligion was a big part of it too.  Back then, Americans weren't too fond of Catholics and Kings, just like they weren't too keen on Communism and Fascism later on. It was all about what ya believed and who was runnin' things. Just like how the US and Russia were at odds during the Cold War, but instead of politics, it was religion that was the main problem.  And it all went back to those old days when the English and Spanish were always fightin'.\n\nThey had a whole bunch of arguments over the years, somethin' like 17!  Most of them were about land, with people crossin' the border and causin' trouble.  Fence-mendin' time, ya know?  \n\nBut eventually, Mexico started dependin' on the US for a lot of stuff, and that kinda cooled things down.  By the late 1800s, the US was more interested in business than in taking more land, so they finally settled down.",
            "Fifteen years ago, things went south for me. I got sick.   A real nasty one, out of nowhere.  See, I was a nurse, always dreamt of being a scientist or a writer, but everyone told me to be a nurse, said it was safe, always in demand.  So, here I was, 46, single, broke, and couldn't work.  Been on disability ever since,  15 years now.  Can't say I own much of anything.  Every day's a struggle, gotta fight for my security, for my sanity.  Nothing's certain anymore, but one thing's for sure: I couldn't have made it this far without my family and a few good friends.  When life throws you a curveball, you realize just how strong you are, or ain't.\n\n\nMy point is, life throws curveballs, big and small.  You can plan for some, but some things are just too big to handle alone.  Now, I get folks talkin' about smaller government, and Lord knows, it ain't exactly runnin' smooth these days. But instead of everyone building their own bunkers, I say we start trustin' each other again.  Helpin' out, ask for help when you need it.\n\nThey say America was built on rugged individualism, but that ain't the whole story.  Our forefathers got through tough times 'cause they looked out for each other, shared what they had, cared for one another.  Those pioneers crossin' the Rockies, they didn't make it alone, did they?\n\nSo, be prepared, I am. Got my disaster kit, first aid stuff, water purification tablets, even plastic sheeting for the windows if we ever get hit with somethin' nasty.  Got flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, and a pantry full of canned goods.  If you got the space, grow your own food, can it, pickle it, whatever.  Wood stove's a good idea too, if you ain't livin' in an apartment.\n\nBut here's the thing:  while you're stockin' up, get to know your neighbors. That's what truly matters.",
            "So, ya know how creatures change over time, right?  Like, why do they become the way they are?  Is there some kinda rulebook for how they gotta evolve? Back in '17, some fella named Thompson said even figuring out the simplest animal in math words was harder than it looked. And today, well, it's still tough!\n\nBut folks are tryin'.  They're usin' math to figure out how seashells, like those spiral kinda ones, grow and change over time.  They're usin' fancy computer programs and pictures of shells to see what shapes they *could* make, and then tryin' to figure out how those shapes actually happened in real life.\n\nThink of a seashell like a little tube windin' around and around. Each loop is called a whorl, and they all go around a center line called the columella.  \n\nThese whorls can get bigger or smaller, and there's a line called a suture between each one.  Usually, the biggest whorl is the last one, and all the rest are called the spire.  The pointy end of the spire is the apex, and the other end, well, that's the base.  And there's a hole called the aperture where the critter lives.\n\nSo, these scientists are tryin' to figure out how all these parts work together to make a shell, and how they change over time. They're usin' math to see what's possible and then tryin' to figure out how those possibilities come true in nature.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya somethin' about these numbers in Indonesia.  \n\nFor the last ten years, babies ain't been doin' so hot.  They ain't dyin' off at a crazy rate, but they ain't gettin' any healthier neither.  Indonesia's doin' okay on some stuff, like gettin' clean water and toilets, but when it comes to moms and babies, they ain't doin' so hot.  They gotta step it up if they wanna meet their goals by 2015.\n\nSee, they're sayin' more babies are bein' born with a doctor or midwife around, which sounds good, right?  Well, not so fast.  A lot of these midwives ain't really trained to handle anythin' serious, so when somethin' goes wrong, well, it ain't good.  That's why so many moms are dyin' from bleedin' out.  \n\nAnd here's another thing: less kids are gettin' help when they're sick, especially with the tummy bugs.  And what about after the baby's born?  Nobody's really keepin' track of that, but it ain't lookin' good.  \n\nThey ain't doin' enough cesarean sections either.  Only 4% of the time.  Now, in the cities, it's 7%, but in the country, it's only 2%.  That tells ya somethin', don't it?  Healthcare ain't reachin' everyone.  It's like the rich folks get all the good stuff and the poor folks are left behind.\n\nSo, what's the answer?  Should they just focus on fixin' one problem at a time, or should they just make the whole healthcare system better?  Well, it's a tough call.  \n\nProgram-specific stuff sounds good, cuz it's easier to see what's workin' and what ain't.  But you know what? Sometimes that means they'll forget about other stuff and everyone'll be tryin' to grab money for their own program.  Plus, it gets confusing with so many different programs doin' the same thing.",
            "Alright, listen up. These fancy Victorian books, they're all about the little details and the rich folks back in the day. But then you got these two, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" they're different kinda beasts. They're like, \"Let's throw in some mystery and some crazy stuff,\" ya know?  It ain't your typical Victorian novel.  This mystery stuff, it makes the characters come alive, ya see? It shows you what they're really thinkin' and feelin'. \n\nTake this part from \"Oliver Twist,\" for instance:\n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\nThese books use mystery, like dreams or somethin', to show you what's goin' on inside their characters.  Like with Oliver, these weird happenings, they show ya what's botherin' him, what he's really seein' in this messed up world. When they finally revisit the shootin' of Oliver, he relives it in his head, like a bad dream. He's tryin' to find help, but it's like he's stuck, ya know? The passage shows how Oliver's got no control over nothin'. He's in bad shape, seein' things, and these hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit are just makin' it worse.  The shootin' just overwhelms him. He can't even feel the pain, it's constant. It's all just fear now. You gotta wonder who's really behind all this bad luck, 'cause it ain't Oliver. This shootin' shows how powerless Oliver really is. He can't even try to stop it, not even when his life is on the line. It's like Old Fagin's broken him, made him give up, ya know?\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.\"",
            "A couple years back, I was workin' at this after-school program, helpin' out those little rugrats with their schoolwork. I was pretty good at English and readin', so I mostly helped out with those. This one kid, Adrian, maybe third or fourth grade, was givin' me fits.  Seemed like he couldn't read worth a lick. He'd nail some words, then totally botch others, real strange. Now, I knew he was Latino, and he spoke perfect English, so it was confusing as heck. \n\nWe were strugglin' to get anywhere when his momma came in one day. Now, she didn't speak a lick of English, only Spanish.  Me, I was just learnin' a few words myself, but we managed to communicate somehow. And then it hit me, like a ton of bricks! Adrian could read fine, he just didn't know the English alphabet that well.  \n\nI don't know if that helped him much, but I hope he's doin' better now. \n\nThat's why I'm talkin' about this language barrier in schools, especially here in California. It ain't always as obvious as ya think. Even if a kid speaks English, readin' it can still be a real struggle. \n\nWe all know this problem exists, so what do we do about it? For Adrian, it was simple:  help him with the English alphabet and pronunciation. But for kids who barely speak English, it's way more complicated. Ain't no one-size-fits-all answer.  Dual language programs,  immersion, private tutors, ESL classes, none of it works solo. We gotta combine 'em all!\n\nFirst off, dual language programs are a good idea, not just for Spanish speakers, but for everyone. You know, kids in those programs do better in school. Some folks are scared, thinkin' it's a waste of money, but that ain't true. \n\nIf we made these programs the norm instead of the exception, everyone would benefit. But how do we do it? We can't make every teacher bilingual, that's crazy talk. But we can have bilingual aides, tutors, whatever ya wanna call 'em, to help out.",
            "Listen, you ever think about why we're all here? I mean, what's the big picture?  Some folks, they go to church or temple, or just try to figure it out on their own.  A lot of us just go along with what our folks taught us, but some, well, they say \"Nah, ain't nothin' out there but what we can see.\" They live for themselves, just their own world, ya know?  And sometimes folks change their minds about all that, what they believe.  No matter what, we're all searchin', tryin' to make sense of it all. We're lookin' for somethin' to guide us, somethin' bigger than ourselves.\n\nMy old man, he always liked cardinals. We were sittin' on the porch, rain hammerin' down, smokin' cigarettes. The gutters were overflowin', and the plants were gettin' soaked. He was lookin' out at the rain, like he was thinkin' about somethin' far away. He'd gotten thinner, his clothes baggy, and his hair was gettin' sparse. He didn't look at me much, just kept starin' at that rain. I felt lost, scared, but I couldn't bring myself to talk about missin' him. It would just make it too real.  So I hugged him, sat back down, and just watched the rain with him.\n\nHe kicked the bucket that December, just five days after I turned 22. The chemo and radiation kept him alive longer than the doctors thought, but it didn't stop the pain. I couldn't figure out what good it did.  If there's a God out there, I thought, he ain't listenin' to me anymore.\n\nI didn't wanna watch him die. I just couldn't. I wanted to remember him how he was, not how he went. Besides, I knew him better than anyone else. I knew he wouldn't want me there watchin' him fade away. So I hid in my bed for three days, waitin' for the news.\n\nNobody even called.",
            "Alright, so this \"Gothic Novel\" thing, it's a real head-scratcher, kinda like when you try to figure out what your Uncle Bubba's talkin' about. This Ian Watt fella, he calls it an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" which means it's both old and new at the same time.  People have been trashin' it, praisin' it, sayin' it's got no depth, then turnin' around and sayin' it's got this \"terrible sublime\" thing goin' on.  That's what Burke said, anyway.  See, this first \"Gothic Novel,\" \"The Castle of Otranto\" by Horace Walpole, it took bits and pieces from those ol' romances and those newfangled novels and mixed 'em together. He called it a \"Gothic Story.\" Kinda like how I like to mix up a good ol' fashioned whiskey with a splash of somethin' sweet.\n\nWalpole, he used all this stuff from old theater and tried to make it fit with the new way of writin' novels. He wanted people to get inside the characters' heads, you know? That's what makes Gothic novels stick around so long, even though they're old as dirt. It's like wearin' your grandpa's boots - they're old, but they still work!\n\nOne of the big things in Gothic novels is this \"Chivalry\" thing. Back in the day, they had these knights, all brave and honorable, and that's what folks were tryin' to be like. But these writers, like Walpole, they thought folks weren't so chivalrous anymore. So they wrote about these knights to make folks remember what they'd lost.\n\nWalpole, he was worried about the world back then, there was a lot of trouble goin' on. Maybe he thought folks had forgotten how to be good, you know? He put that idea into his stories, especially in this character, Frederic. This Frederic fella, he was like a knight outta a fairytale: he was a prince, he'd been through some bad stuff, and everyone thought he was dead.  He's like the poster boy for chivalry, but maybe a little too perfect, kinda like that guy at the gym who's always showin' off.",
            "Alright, so let me tell ya 'bout this thing called supply chain management.  It's like, how ya get stuff from when someone wants it, all the way back to where it started, you know?  This fella, Keith Oliver, came up with the name back in '82. He figured out it's all 'bout makin' sure you get what folks want, fast and cheap.  \n\nNow, there's six big parts to this whole shebang: makin' the stuff, gettin' the stuff, keepin' track of the stuff, knowin' where the stuff is, movin' the stuff, and talkin' 'bout the stuff.  Basically, you gotta do all these things right to keep your customers happy.\n\nFirst off, ya gotta make the stuff. That's the heart of it all.  Gotta figure out what folks want, when they want it, how much they want, and where to make it.  You gotta watch the market, see what people are buyin', and then decide what to build.  Like, if everyone's buyin' red pickup trucks, ya better be makin' red pickup trucks!  \n\nThen ya gotta figure out where to build 'em.  You gotta think about the best place to make the stuff,  keepin' in mind how much it costs and how good it has to be.  After that, ya gotta make a plan for makin' the stuff, makin' sure the machines are workin' right and the workers know what they're doin'.\n\nNext up is gettin' all the parts you need.  You might have different places makin' different parts, like one place for the engines and another for the seats.  Ya gotta make sure all those parts get to the right place at the right time.  Sometimes, ya might even outsource some stuff to other companies.  That's just a fancy way of sayin' ya hire someone else to make somethin' for ya.  It's like when ya take ya car to the mechanic, ya ain't makin' the car yourself, ya just gettin' someone else to do it.",

They got this mean ol' bunch runnin' things, like a bunch of bullies takin' over the schoolyard.  Back in 2007, some monks, they put on their saffron robes, like a fancy uniform, and started marchin' 'cause they weren't happy.   The government, well, they didn't take too kindly to it.  Got real nasty, started beatin' folks up, even killed some journalists, just plain wrong. \n\nNow, this ain't nothin' new, folks.  Governments tryin' to keep folks in line, stomp on anyone speakin' out, that's been goin' on since the cavemen, I reckon.  The Romans, they thought they were gods, runnin' everything. And them Japanese emperors, they thought they were gods too!  Heck, even our own President, George W. Bush, he talks to some fella named Ted Haggard, who runs a group called Stupid People Worldwide.\n\nYou remember that time in China, back in '89?  They had these folks protestin', students and teachers and all, 'cause they didn't like how the government was runnin' things.  Well, the government got real mad, started shootin' folks.  Nobody knows exactly how many died, but it was a whole lot.  Then there was that Rwandan thing, back in the 90s, where they went after all the Tutsis.  And don't forget about Hitler and his bunch, they rounded up all the Jews and...well, you know.",
            "Duke Ellington, he was a real piano man, and he knew how to make his band sound good. He wasn't always the flashiest player, but he sure knew how to write tunes that showed off his guys. Ellington, he'd set up these frameworks where a musician could really let loose and improvise, and he'd also write these tight, orchestrated parts that made each guy in the band sound their best. It was like he knew exactly what made each guy tick, ya know?  He built this sound, this whole vibe, that was all his own.  People say his stuff was some of the most original and brilliant jazz ever made.\nThis dictionary, the Grove Music one, they say Ellington was always usin' the voice as an instrument. This song, \"Creole Love Call\", it shows what he meant. He used the voice to add this texture and color, without all the fuss of words. And it showed how he could make his soloists shine.  This slow blues song, it's got these six different parts, each one different and special.\n\n\nThe first part, it's like a conversation between the voice and the woodwinds, starts smooth, then gets rougher.  The second part, a trumpet solo, playin' muted,  stretchin' out the melody and addin' these bluesy notes.   The third part, the clarinet takes over, playin' high and sweet, with the piano doin' this subtle, syncopated thing in the background.  The fourth part, the whole band chimes in, like a call and response between the brass and the woodwinds.  The fifth part, that's the big one, the woodwinds callin' and respondin' high and bright, with the brass and rhythm section doin' this stop-time thing, like a heartbeat. Then the last part, it goes back to the first part, the voice and the woodwinds talkin' again, but this time the voice gets all raspy, like it's singin' on its own.  Then there's a little tag at the end, a vocal run and a trombone playin' somethin' kinda dissonant, just for fun.\n\nEllington usin' the voice like that, it's like he was colorin' the whole song.  And this was just one of the things he did. In another song, \"Hot and Bothered\", he takes this muted trumpet player, \"Bubber\" Miley, and this scat singer, Baby Cox, and he makes 'em sound like they're talkin' to each other. It's like the trumpet is singin' and the voice is playin' an instrument.  He did the same thing in \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\", usin' this trombone player, Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, to start the melody in a way that was just perfect.",

It started when she was about 14, just gettin' into that teenage thing, and it was still there three years later, when she was 17. By then, she figured out she wanted someone, not some shiny new thing. But she just wasn't feelin' it for any boys. Some fellas tried to woo her, all awkward and shy, but nothin' ever clicked. She'd wrack her brain, tryin' to figure out why she felt this way, a plain ol' teenage girl with no interest in fellas.  She had a few theories, but nothin' stuck. So she just kept livin', always wonderin' about this feelin' inside her. \n\nNow, her folks were good people, calm and quiet. They never fought, and she hardly ever got in trouble with 'em. The only time they butted heads was when she tried to act like she was all grown up. She was a sweet kid, but she had a big, boisterous personality that stood out against her parents' laid-back vibes. It made her likeable, though. Everyone liked her.\n\nThis day, though, wasn't one of those calm days. She was moseyin' around the house, lookin' for somethin' to get her goin', when she heard a yelp from the kitchen. It was her mama, and she sounded hurt. She ran in, panickin', \"Mom! What's wrong?!\" Her mama was sprawled on the floor, grimachin' and sayin' \"Ow\" between breaths.  She rushed over and put her hand on her mama, tryin' to help. \"Ouch... sweety, I... need you to take me to... the hospital.\"\n\nHer words were choked out, and her daughter knew it was bad. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to meet you.\" Her mama pointed, and her daughter, glad she'd taken those self-defense classes, scooped her mama up and carried her to the car. She laid her down in the back seat and drove like a bat outta hell.\n\nThe hospital smelled like sickness and fear, but she didn't notice. She was too busy lookin' after her mama. She rushed her in, yellin' for help. A bunch of doctors gathered around, and someone wheeled her mama to a bed.

            "So, listen up!  This here study wanted to see if eatin' like folks in the Mediterranean, we're talkin' the \"aMed diet,\" would keep ya heart healthy and keep ya from havin' a stroke.  Now, this \"aMed diet\" is like a fancy way of sayin' eat yer fruits, veggies, nuts, and fish, and cut back on the meat and greasy stuff. A little wine's okay too, just don't go overboard. \n\nSee, they done some studies before, and they found that folks who ate like this were less likely to die from heart problems.  They even did a test where they told folks to eat this way, and they lost weight and their cholesterol got better.  But nobody really looked at strokes before.\n\nSo, they got 74,886 women, good lookin' nurses mostly, ages 38 to 63, and asked 'em what they ate for 20 years. They gave these ladies these fancy questionaires,  like \"How much broccoli ya eatin'?\"  They even checked their records to make sure they were tellin' the truth.  They also looked at how much they smoked, if they took vitamins, and if they were usin' hormone stuff after menopause.  \n\nThey figured out that the women who ate more like folks in the Mediterranean were less likely to have a heart attack or a stroke.  Out of all the ladies, 2391 had a heart attack, 1763 had a stroke, and 1077 died from heart problems. The ladies who ate the best were 29% less likely to have a heart attack or stroke.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya, back in '07, this whole country went belly up. Jobs were scarcer than hen's teeth, houses were worth nothin', and even big ol' companies went bust. And guess what? This mess ain't over yet! We gotta figure out what went wrong and how to stop this whole dang train wreck.\n\nSee, it all started with these slick politicians makin' decisions that were about as smart as a possum in a rainstorm. They pressured banks and businesses to give out loans to folks who couldn't afford 'em. It was like pourin' gasoline on a fire, and the whole thing went up in smoke!\n\nNow, there's these fancy organizations called Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. They were supposed to help folks buy homes, but they were gettin' pressured to buy up all these bad loans, pack 'em up like Christmas presents, and sell 'em off to everyone. When folks stopped payin' their mortgages, the whole house of cards came tumblin' down.\n\nThis whole mess started back in the Clinton days. He was tryin' to get re-elected, so he made it easier for folks to get loans, even if they weren't exactly financially stable. Some folks, like this fella Steven Holmes from the New York Times, saw the writing on the wall and warned about what could happen. But nobody listened.\n\nAnd let me tell ya, these newfangled mortgages were somethin' else. They had all these fancy names like \"adjustable-rate mortgages\" and \"collateralized debt obligations.\"  It was like a big ol' tangled mess, and nobody really understood how it all worked.\n\nAll those fancy financial games left folks with more debt than they could handle. And when the housing bubble burst, it was like a bomb goin' off in the economy. Big banks like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers went kaput, and even Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to change their tune. Fannie and Freddie were in deep trouble too, and the government had to step in and bail 'em out.",
            "Listen up, writers! We all know the golden rule: \"Show, don't tell.\" But sometimes, even the best of us get caught up in the weeds and end up with too much talkin' and not enough action. That's where exposition comes in—the part of the story where you dump a whole bucket of information on the reader. It's like watching someone tell you a story while they monopolize the entire conversation. \n\nThink of it like this:  You're reading a story and the author goes on and on about how the main character met her hubby, got hitched in a big ol' shindig, and then BAM! He gets whacked right in front of her eyes. Now, nobody wants to read two pages of that, with characters talking like robots and not showing any real emotion. \n\nInstead, the author should give us some juicy details about this hubby fella. Let us see how much he loved his wife through his words and actions. Show us how she changed and grew because of him. Get us invested in his story so that when he meets his maker, we feel the pain along with her.  \n\nWe want the story to have some meat on its bones! We want to be drawn in and feel like we're right there in the middle of it all.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya 'bout these newscasts I watched from Columbus, Ohio. First up was NBC 4 this mornin', August 13th, 2011.  They lead with this story 'bout this Shad Hostettler fella in Ashley, Ohio. Stabbed his wife good, they said - didn't say her name though.  He looked like a real piece of work, that's for sure. They only gave it couple minutes, seein' as how it was still fresh.  Didn't give too many details, just that he stabbed her a bunch and they got him.  Seemed like about right, y'know?\n\nNext up was this Travis Buyers kid, 18 years old, shot in Sharon Woods.  Critically hurt, they said, and nobody had a clue who did it. SWAT team was on the case.  This one seemed kinda rushed, though.  Makes you wonder, don't it?  Maybe 'cause it was a black kid?  Cause I've noticed, and I'm talkin' for years now, they don't give minorities the same attention when they're in trouble.  If it's a white kid, missing or hurt, they go nuts. But a black kid? Lucky if they even mention it.\n\nThen they had this story about a bullet hole in a Med-Flight helicopter.  .22 caliber, they said, from a rifle.  They were offering five grand for tips, tryin' to catch the shooter.\n\nNext up was the weather, talkin' 'bout rain and thunderstorms comin' Saturday.  They said it'd be in the low eighties all weekend.   Kinda short on that one, like they were just teasin' ya.\n\nThen they had this story 'bout a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road.  Said the guy was a dark-skinned black fella, wearin' a hoodie.  Six foot tall, about one hundred and fifty pounds.  Seemed like they kept goin' on 'bout the color of his skin, don't ya think?\n\nLast one was 'bout this Rene Rodriguez, some big-shot drug dealer from Texas.  They said he was caught sellin' a whole lotta weed to Ohio.  He got 300 months - that's 25 years, for them keepin' score. They even mentioned he was Hispanic.  Not really sure why they thought that mattered.",
            "Brothers, they're somethin' else, ain't they?  Like nothin' else in the world, ya know?  Love 'em, hate 'em, get mad at 'em, but they're always there.  They see right through ya, like lookin' in a mirror.  Sometimes that's good, sometimes it's real bad.   Like,  brothers understand each other, more than anyone else. They see themselves in each other, good and bad.  When things get rough, that's when ya really see what kinda bond they got.  It can be powerful, strong as hell, but it can also hurt like crazy. \n\nThis book, \"The Scarlet Ibis\", it talks about that bond,  the good and the bad.  Two brothers, settin' out on this crazy journey, and it all goes south.   One brother, he's got this pride thing goin' on, thinks he's better than the other.  It's like he wants this perfect brother, someone to match him, ya know?  But the other brother, he's different.  He can't keep up, can't do all the things the older brother wants to do.  They're both different, they both got somethin' to learn.  The story shows how pride can hurt, how it can lead to bad decisions.  It's a tough read, but it makes ya think, ya know?",
            "Y'all listen up, cuz this brain thing is a real head scratcher, kinda like tryin' to figure out what my brother was talkin' about after a night out dancin'. \n\nSee, back in the day, folks thought the brain was like a wax tablet, ya know, somethin' ya could write on and wipe clean. Then it was like papyrus, like them old scrolls. Then folks got fancy and said it was like a book. Now, these brainy scientists, they say it's like a computer. But lemme tell ya, all these comparisons, they ain't always right.\n\nSo, you gotta understand, this brain of ours, it's like a big ol' factory, takin' in all sorts of stuff. You see somethin', hear somethin', feel somethin', all that gets turned into signals, like little messages. Then, your brain, it's like a master chef, takin' those messages and cookin' up somethin' outta them. It's a two-way street, too. It's like, sometimes your brain uses what it already knows to figure things out faster, kinda like when you see a box and you know right away what it is.\n\nAnd then there's this thing called attention, it's like a bouncer at a club, choosin' what gets in and what gets tossed out. Your brain's got so much goin' on, it can't pay attention to everything. It's like, you see a million blades of grass, but you don't really notice each one. But if someone says your name, bam! You hear it clear as day.\n\nNow, your brain, it's gotta store all this information, like a giant library. There's different kinds of memory, short-term, long-term, all sorts of things. It's like, you hear somethin', you gotta hold onto it for a bit, then maybe tuck it away for later. And how it all gets organized, well, that's a whole other story, like tryin' to figure out the whole damn Dewey Decimal System.",
            "Listen up, folks! This here Huxley fella, he's got somethin' to say about all this fancy newfangled technology and the way the money folks run things. See, in his book, \"Brave New World,\" folks are all about lookin' out for each other, but they ain't thinkin' for themselves none. They're all about havin' a good time right now, no matter what.  \n\nIt's like they're puppets, y'know?  This big boss man, the World Controller, he's pullin' all the strings.  And Huxley, he's sayin' this whole thing is gonna mess us up somethin' fierce.  He's talkin' about how the rich folks are keepin' the poor folks in the dark, makin' them think they're better off than they really are.  He sees right through it, just like I see through a politician's promises.  It's all smoke and mirrors, folks.  \n\nHe calls it \"false consciousness,\" like they're dreamin' a dream they think is real.  But the truth is, they're gettin' used, used like a cheap tool.  They're buyin' into a system that ain't doin' nothin' but line the pockets of the fat cats.   \n\nAnd these folks, they ain't even thinkin' 'bout it.  They're too busy chasin' after the next shiny thing, the next pleasure.  They don't even know how to feel real emotions anymore, let alone fight back.   \n\nIt's a sad state of affairs, folks.  And Huxley, he's tryin' to wake us up.  He's sayin' we gotta start thinkin' for ourselves, gotta see through the lies.   We gotta fight for our freedom, or we're gonna end up livin' in a world where we're nothin' but cogs in a machine.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya, this here Uni Park's a right pain in the neck to get around, especially if ya live like me, way out East Halls, where the sun don't shine and the wind blows hard enough to blow ya off your feet.  It's a good thing I ain't got to walk all the way to Willard Buildin' - that's like walkin' from here to Dallas!  Used to be, there was nothin' out there but open fields, but now they're buildin' all sorts of fancy stuff - sports fields, new buildings, even apartments.  Makes ya wonder what's next, a dang rodeo?  Point is, this place keeps gettin' bigger, and harder to navigate.  \n\nNow, I reckon the best way to get around this campus is on a dang bicycle.  But a bicycle ain't gonna do ya no good if nobody's ridin' it, and the campus ain't built for bikes.  \n\nI was talkin' to my buddy the other day, and he said he'd been ridin' again after takin' a break for a few years.  He said, \"Man, why'd I ever stop?  Bikes are the only way to get around these parts.\"  He's right, ya know?  Besides bein' good for ya, they're the fastest way to get from Point A to Point B.  I ain't talkin' 'bout no fancy mountain bike, just a regular ol' bike, and a bowl of grits for breakfast will get ya goin' for 30 miles or more.\n\nI live off campus now, just as far from the center of campus as some of those dorms.  Best thing I did this year was buy a bike.  Used to take me a good 25 minutes to walk to my class in Thomas Buildin'.  Now, whiz on over there in 5 minutes flat if I pedal like the wind.  The only problem is, Pollock Road ain't always the friendliest place for a bike.\n\nWalkin' ain't bad, but I ain't got time for it.  Without my bike, I'd be walkin' to class every day, and that's a whole lotta time wasted.  Think about it, over 2 1/2 hours a week just walkin' to class.  Add that to walkin' to other places, and I ain't got no time for nothin' else."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

I wanna lend a hand, ya hear?   I believe in doin' right by folks, treatin' 'em with respect, and always doin' the honest thing.  Help folks get along better, and keep learnin' so I can do my job right.   \n\nSee, I always wanted to help people, but I didn't know how. In high school and college, I saw folks runnin' from their problems, some even doin' things that ain't right.  Made me think, ya know?  So I went and got myself a degree in Psychology, thought maybe that'd give me some answers.  After I graduated, I took a little break, just to clear my head. \n\nOne day, I went to see a friend, and there was this young fella, only sixteen, sittin' there lookin' scared.  Turns out, he was runnin' from his parents, 'cause they were bein' mean.  The next day, I heard he called the cops on 'em.  I figured I'd see what I could do, so I went over to their house.  I talked to the cops, told 'em about my degree and my worries. They asked me to talk to the parents, said there wasn't much they could do. \n\nWell, when I talked to the parents, they got all fidgety and started makin' excuses for treatin' their son bad. Said he was tryin' to trick folks,  said it was just a little squabble.  That's when I knew, right then and there, I wanted to be a social worker.  Help those kids, ya know?  \n\nAnother thing that's important to me is doin' what's right, standin' up for what's fair.

It's like sayin' if you're always stressed 'cause you ain't got enough dough or you're livin' in a rough part of town, you might not sleep too well.\n\nThey talk about all these different sleep problems, like when you can't fall asleep or you sleep too much, or when you fall asleep standin' up!  And some folks have nightmares or sleepwalkin'.  \n\nThe paper talks about a bunch of studies, sayin' some folks are born with a messed up sleep switch in their brains, and that makes it hard to sleep right.

It's like this:  your ears can hear fine, but your brain, well, it's got trouble makin' sense of all that sound stuff.\n\nFirst off, let me tell ya what CAPD is. It's when your brain, the big boss, ain't quite good at understandin' what your ears are pickin' up.  It's like tryin' to understand someone talkin' real fast with a mouth full of marbles!  You can hear the sounds, but makin' out the words, that's a whole 'nother story.\n\nNow, how do you know if someone's got CAPD?

Well, there are things you can do to help 'em out.  Like, makin' sure they're sittin' near the front of the room, where they can hear you best.  And speakin' clearly and at a moderate pace.

            "Germany today is a real powerhouse, a country that's come together with its own unique culture. You can feel it everywhere, from the fancy city of München nestled in the Alps all the way to Kiel by the Baltic Sea. Then there's Köln on the Rhine River, Dresden in Saxony by the Elbe –  it's a blend of history and tradition that makes Germany so special.  It's no surprise that this awesome country has roots from all sorts of different tribes and groups. \n\nThey call the land where the Germans live \"Germania\".  But where did that name come from?  Well, everyone's got their own theory. This guy Tacitus, a writer back in the day, said it came from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians. He figured they were called \"Germans\" before they crossed the Rhine and fought with the Gauls. Then there's Julius Caesar, who used the word \"Germanus\" in his writings about the Gallic Wars. He was fighting the Gauls and these Germanic tribes who kept sneaking across the Rhine. Caesar used the word to tell the difference between who he had conquered (the Gauls) and who he hadn't. Some folks think the Gauls gave him the word, others say it came from a spear the Germans used in battle called a \"ger\".  Maybe it even comes from an old Irish word for \"shout\" because, you know, Germans are known for being loud! \n\nTacitus wrote a book about the origins of the Germans called \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" way back in 98 AD.  He thought the Germans were original folks, not mixed with other races.  He even said, “Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?”\n\nAnd you know who wouldn't go to Germania? The Romans! They'd march in for goods and fight a few battles, but mostly they stayed home in their big empire. So the Germanic tribes hung out on the edges of the Roman world in the 1st century, trading stuff they got from the land and even serving in the Roman army.",

It was like watchin' a movie, but I didn't understand the story.\n\nOnce, this artist buddy told me about this book, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" Said it could teach ya how to draw anything.  \n\nHe said if you want to draw somethin' real good, you gotta break it down. Like, if you see a whole room,  just focus on one thing, like a bowl of fruit.  It's like takin' a picture and makin' it smaller, easier to understand.\n\nBut this stuff I was lookin' at, it was too much. I felt like I was staring at somethin' outta this world. Like, Picasso had his blue period, Monet loved flowers, and all those fancy Italian painters, they used every color in the book. I figured, if I was gonna be an artist, I gotta start somewhere. And this, right here, this was my start. My \"Masterpiece in Brown.\"  \n\nI reached out, my hand tremblin' a little, like I was holdin' a magic wand. My mind was sayin' one thing, but my body was doin' somethin' else. The water swirled, lookin' all calm and peaceful. Then, somethin' happened. The brown stuff, it wouldn't budge. It was stuck like glue.\n\nMy heart was beatin' faster now. This wasn't what I had in mind.  I was wearin' this stupid tie, my feet felt funny, and all I could think about was this mess. I was like a waiter at a fancy restaurant, but instead of servin' food, I was servin' up...well, you know.  I took a deep breath, grabbed the mop, and got to work.  I swear, it felt like I was preparin' for a Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya, these young whippersnappers are dyin' behind the wheel somethin' fierce! It's like a recipe for disaster, ya know?  The big brains over at the National Institutes of Health say that their brains ain't quite cooked yet for all the craziness of drivin'. And let's face it, they ain't got much experience either.  That lack of know-how leads to a whole heap of accidents, rollovers, speedin', and even drivin' off the road!\n\nNow, these kids, they love cruisin' around with their buddies, and we all know it.  A bunch of 'em piled in a car is like a recipe for trouble. These brainiacs down in California did a study showin' just how much worse things get when the passenger's a peer.  \n\nThey've tried to fix this by givin' young'uns these temporary licenses that put limits on when they can drive and who they can have in the car. But that's just a band-aid on a bullet hole, if ya ask me.\n\nThe real problem is that these young drivers, statistically speakin', ain't cut out for the road yet.  This fella Zuckerman, a psychologist, says even 18's too young for a real license.  He's done all sorts of research showin' that young folks, 19 and under, just crave that thrill, that rush.  Waitin' a bit longer, until they calm down a bit, might be a good idea.\n\nWe keep givin' 'em licenses, we're gonna see more and more young folks gettin' hurt. With all those baby boomers' kids turnin' 16 soon, we're lookin' at a real catastrophe on the roads.  \n\nHere's what we gotta do:  Keep teachin' 'em in school, but no one under 18 gets behind the wheel. We can still have those learner's permits and all that, and they gotta get their hours in with a grown-up.  California, they already do 6 hours of drivin' with an instructor and 50 hours with a parent or somethin'.\n\nWe need a nationwide law on this, somethin' that protects everyone.  It ain't a new idea, but it's a darn good one.",
            "Listen, I was lookin' at these old Edison movies, you know, the ones from way back in the day,  like before World War I. There were fifteen of these \"trick\" movies, and they were all about pullin' the wool over your eyes. They use some fancy cuttin' and whatnot to make things look like magic. I tried to figure out how these movies worked, ya know, like the rules of the game. Most of 'em are pretty basic, like they were filmed on a stage. The camera never moves, it just sits there like it's watchin' a play. And the actors, they only move back and forth, never towards or away from the camera. Like somethin' outta  those old vaudeville shows.  They even stick to these long shots, like you're way back in the audience. No close-ups, not even once.  \n\nAnd the whole thing is like one big trick, ya see? Each trick is like one whole movie, only a minute or so long. They just gotta get the trick done quick, like a magic show. But don't let that fool ya, sometimes they'll stitch together a bunch of little shots to make it look like somethin' disappeared or somethin'. Watch this one, \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" from way back in 1895.  It looks like one shot, but if you look real close, you'll see where they switch things out.  Sneaky, huh?",
            "Now listen here folks, this John Taylor fella, he was a real firebrand when it came to bein' a Republican.  Worked the land himself,  but that didn't stop him from talkin' up his beliefs, loud and clear.  He was all about folks being free to do their own thing, especially when it came to runnin' their own farms.  That's what drove his whole outlook on government, see?  He figured  the government was best when it kept its nose out of folks' business and let 'em get on with their lives.\n\nJohn Taylor, he thought America had a chance to build somethin' real special, somethin' that hadn't been done before.  He felt like we were startin' fresh, with no old ways holdin' us back.  He believed folks were born with rights, you know,  rights that couldn't be messed with by the government.  He figured if you take away one right,  they all start to crumble.\n\nTo make this dream work, Taylor thought the government had to be built right. He knew folks are good and bad, so the government had to keep both sides in check.  He was a straight shooter,  believed there was right and wrong,  and he thought the government should stick to what's right.  He felt a good government protects your property, helps farmers, and doesn't get too big for its britches.  He believed folks would always look out for themselves, but that's not always a bad thing if it helps the whole country.  \n\nTaylor, like a lot of his Republican buddies, believed the Constitution should be read exactly as it was written.  He didn't want the government gettin' too powerful,  costin' too much money,  or bossin' folks around.  But he also knew you gotta understand what the folks who wrote it meant,  not just read the words on the page.  He even thought the Declaration of Independence was more important 'cause it talked about states bein' independent, not just one big country.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya, seein' that chart in Figure 17, it was like  someone pulled the plug on those commuter logs in the third month.  Kinda bummed me out,  I gotta say.  Hard to figure out why folks stopped fillin' 'em out.  You know, up here in New England, when winter hits, folks ain't walkin' or bikin' much anymore.  That could explain some of it, I reckon.  December's also when the semester's endin' and everyone's runnin' around tryin' to finish their work, get their grades, and all that jazz.  Maybe the log just slipped their minds.  And then there's the holidays, man.  It's a whole month long break for students and teachers, nobody's even on campus most of the time!  Then school starts back up in January, and that might explain why there weren't many logs then either.  But nothin' explains why February was so slow.\n\nI guess folks get all excited about new projects at first, then the fire dies down, ya know?  So we tried to crank things up again with a special \"Carpool Challenge Week\" in March, and that brought the logs back up a bit.  We learned that keepin' folks engaged is tough, especially with all the holidays and breaks in academia. \n\nAnother thing, folks love their cars.  It's just part of our American way of life.  So, we gotta give 'em somethin' good to switch over, ya know?  We gave away all sorts of prizes, gift cards to restaurants, coffee shops, massage places, even the bookstore.  I wonder though, if we'd given away some real big prizes, like a new bike, a hybrid car, or even an electric one, would that've gotten more folks involved?  Maybe it would've stopped that dip in the logs.  \n\nWe kept the prizes the same throughout the whole project.  But what if we'd upped the ante?  Maybe if we'd announced some fancy bikes in December, and then a hybrid or electric car in January, folks would've been more motivated to log their commutes.",
            "Well shoot, lemme tell ya 'bout these fancy things called ETFs. They're kinda like those index funds, but you can buy 'em and sell 'em like regular ol' stocks. Think of it like this: you want to own a piece of the whole stock market, but you don't wanna pick out each stock yourself. An ETF does that for ya, like a big ol' basket of stocks all wrapped up in one.\n\nThey're cheaper than those mutual funds, and you can buy just a single share, not like some of them funds where you gotta put down a whole truckload of cash.  But here's the kicker: you gotta pay a fee every time you buy or sell, just like with regular stocks.\n\nNow, there's all sorts of ETFs out there, trackin' different things, like the whole market, certain industries, even somethin' called \"hot dogs\" if you believe it! This here one, IHF, is trackin' a bunch of different companies, but lemme tell ya, most of it's tied up in just ten of 'em.\n\nSo I figured, why not just buy those ten companies straight up? See if it's better than buyin' the whole ETF. Turns out, usin' just those ten companies, I might get a better return, and it might even be a little less risky. \n\nNow, I ain't no fancy Wall Street fella, but I reckon it's always good to double-check the numbers.  See if what they're sayin' about diversification and all that jazz is really true.",
            "So, Poe thought this poem, \"Dream-Land\", was pretty darn good. You see, he uses this word \"Thulé\" twice in it, and this guy named Mabbott figured out that Poe got it from Virgil. Virgil, way back when, used \"Thulé\" to talk about an island way up north, like the edge of the world back then. Now, Virgil probably used it first, but Poe was a big fan of German writers, ya know?\n\nOne of these German fellas, Goethe, wrote this poem called \"The King of Thulé\". It's about a king who loses his wife and goes totally bonkers, drinking like crazy and moping around. He ends up giving away all his stuff and throwing himself off a cliff. Sound familiar?  Some smart guy, Karl J. Arndt, said Poe's poem and Goethe's are kinda alike, like Poe was copying him. \n\nGoethe was a big deal back in the day, wrote this famous play called \"Faust\", the first part came out in 1808 and the second one when he died in 1832.  And in the second part of \"Faust\", there's this short poem called \"The King of Thulé\", which is about that same sad king who throws himself off a cliff.  Poe used \"Thulé\" twice in his poems, once in \"Dream-Land\" and once in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\".  Some folks say these two poems, Poe's and Goethe's, they kinda go together. Poe's poem is about this dark and lonely place, haunted by dead friends, just like Goethe's king.\n\nPoe liked Tennyson, and Goethe was a big deal even back then. Poe probably knew about him because everybody was talking about him.",
            "So, lemme ask ya somethin'. This gal, Jennifer, she tripped and fell in a grocery store because some dang applesauce was spilled on the floor. Now, the store manager, this Martin fella, knew about the spill twice before Jennifer went down. But he was too busy eatin' his dinner to clean it up for half an hour! Can Jennifer sue for extra money, ya know, like punishin' the store for bein' so dang careless? \n\nWell, the judge ain't gonna just toss her claim out the window right away.  To get that extra money, Jennifer gotta prove that Martin knew darn well folks could get hurt from that spill, but he just didn't care. She also gotta show he was a real jerk about it.\n\nJennifer can say that Martin shoulda known better 'cause folks had been slipin' and fallin' on spills all year!  Even though he knew this, he still ignored the problem.\n\nNow, sayin' Martin was a real bad apple might be a stretch, but it ain't outta line, ya know?  Six folks had already busted their tails fallin' in that store that year!\n\nHere's the story: This employee, Rich, told Martin about the applesauce spill at 5 pm. Martin said he was on break and didn't wanna deal with it. Then another worker, Mary, told Martin about the spill again at 5:15 pm, but he said the same thing.  At 5:30 pm, Jennifer went down and hurt her back somethin' fierce!\n\nNow, Jennifer's sayin' D&D should pay for her injuries, both for the hurtin' she done and for bein' so dang negligent.  And we gotta figure out if we should ask the judge to throw out the part about punative damages.\n\nSee, in California, you can get extra money if a company acts real bad, even if there ain't no contract involved. They gotta have done somethin' mean, like cheat folks or act with malice.  Malice means they either wanted to hurt folks or they were so dang reckless that they knew they were gonna hurt someone, but didn't care. That's what Jennifer's tryin' to prove with Martin and that applesauce.",
            "So, lemme tell ya somethin'. I took this Islam class, like four years ago, at CBC. One thing we argued about a lot was if Islam was a bad religion, ya know? And now, more than ever, that question feels important. Think about it, after 9/11, the news went from sayin' Islam was bad to sayin' it's totally cool. I mean, could you imagine back in 2001 havin' a prez candidate named Barack Obama, with that Muslim family history? Not a chance!\n\nNow, this book about Muhammad, the prophet, it got me thinkin'. I always thought Muhammad was a kinda tough guy, ya know, conquerin' tribes and makin' 'em turn Muslim. But this book paints him as this martyr, misunderstood, even humble. Like, people came to him on their own, seein' the truth in his words. Kinda makes ya wonder, huh?\n\nAnd listen, this book makes Muhammad sound a lot like Jesus. Take that story about him turnin' a little mutton and milk into enough for forty guys. It's like they're tryin' to make Muhammad look like some kinda miracle worker, just like Jesus. It's kinda sneaky, ya know? Like they're tryin' to steal Jesus' thunder!\n\nThey also got these stories about how people converted to Islam all on their own. But a lot of 'em come from second-hand stories, like \"So-and-so told me, who heard it from so-and-so.\" That kinda stuff makes it sound fishy to me.\n\nBut the worst part is, they try to make Muhammad out to be this perfect man, humble and wise. But history says somethin' different. I gotta wonder if Muslims today even know the real story about how Muhammad got so powerful.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya somethin'.  You see, the way folks been talkin' 'bout Jesus these days ain't nothin' like what he was really preachin'. It's like they got off track, ya know?  Seems like the world's gettin' more open-minded,  makin' progress and all that.  But you still got those old-timers, stuck in their ways,  refusin' to budge.  But they ain't gonna change nothin'. \n\nNow, I reckon folks are gonna start thinkin' 'bout the real Jesus, what he truly meant. They're gonna want to peel back all the layers of stuff that got added over the years. It might take a while, maybe even a long time, but it'll happen.  We're talkin' a whole turnaround, like turnin' back the clock.\n\nFolks are gonna start followin' Jesus like it's the good old days, just his words, nothin' else. The church might still be there, leadin' the way, but it won't be the same.  Everyone's gonna be thinkin' alike, with the same beliefs and doin' things the same way.  \n\nHistory's full of these big changes. Remember when Christians were gettin' persecuted by the Romans?  Then they turned around and became Christians themselves!  Same thing happened here in our country, went from slavery to black folks leadin' the way. \n\nThis whole thing, it's gonna happen in the church too, goin' back to the roots, forgettin' all the extra stuff. And it's gonna be like readin' Jesus' words in a new way, not takin' everything so literally.\n\nSo, what happened since Jesus walked the earth?  Well, it all started with Judaism, the foundation of Christianity.  They believed in only one God, had their scriptures, the whole shebang.  But even then, they weren't all on the same page, split into different groups, like the Sadducees, Pharisees, and those crazy Zealots.",
            "Look, I reckon \"The Jungle\" shows folks are pretty darn greedy, you know? Deep down, they just wanna look out for number one, make their own lives easier, and don't give a hoot about nobody else, especially not the little guy. The book makes that plain as day. \n\nTake them factory owners and bosses, for instance. All they care about is makin' their factories big and fancy, makin' as much dough as they can. They don't give a lick about anyone gettin' hurt or messed up along the way.\n\nUpton Sinclair, he writes about how the factories are like these big, ugly beasts, all black and smokin', spewin' out pollution like it's nothin'. He's tryin' to show how these factory owners just don't care about the people or the animals, just about makin' money. They don't care about the smoke chokin' the air or the mess they're makin' with all the animal waste runnin' around.\n\nAnd the bosses, they don't care about their workers neither. They'll squeeze every penny they can out of 'em, work 'em till they drop, and then lay 'em off without a second thought. Back then, there weren't no laws protectin' workers, so they could get away with anything. It was a dog-eat-dog world, and the workers were the ones gettin' eaten.\n\nSinclair says the workers were like slaves, treated worse than dirt. They had no say in nothin', no way to fight back. They were stuck in this awful system, workin' themselves to the bone just to survive.",
            "Y'all ever notice how some folks try to make you feel a certain way 'bout things? Like, they wanna pump you up or make you all sad and mopey?  Well, F. Scott Fitzgerald, that fella who wrote \"The Great Gatsby,\" he's a real master at that. He uses all sorts of tricks, like pairing words together that don't usually go together, kinda like sayin' \"purple polka-dotted toaster\" - it just makes ya stop and think, ya know? And he's real good at usin' symbols too, like colors.  He takes a color, gives it a meaning, then uses it again and again to make ya think of that same feelin'. \n\nHe's got this whole thing goin' on with colors like gold, green, white, and red.  But the ones he uses the most are white and gray - 'specially white and gray.  He uses 'em to show that somethin' ain't nothin' special, like a bunch of folks all wearin' the same clothes.\n\nSee, white for Fitzgerald means somethin' kinda fancy and nice, like Daisy, she's always in white, even when she's dressin' up for Gatsby's big parties.   But gray, well, that's more like somethin' old and faded, like them big apartment buildings Nick sees in the city.  He uses these colors to show how folks are all the same, like they're parts of a big ol' machine.\n\nThen, when Fitzgerald wants ya to think somethin' ain't important, he uses white and gray for it. He does this with Daisy, for example. After a while, when he keeps describin' her in these colors, she starts to seem less like a person and more like somethin' to be owned, like a fancy car or a piece of jewelry.\n\nSo, Fitzgerald's playin' with colors to make ya feel somethin' specific, like Daisy ain't just a woman, but somethin' more like an idea - somethin' predictable and kinda empty.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya about this little piece of land in San Diego.  It's a real gem.  Sun's always shinin', folks grow all sorts of good eatin' there – tomatoes, citrus, you name it.  Even got folks growin' stuff organic,  they're sellin' it faster than a politician promises a tax cut!\n\nNow, this here land, it's got a history,  been around since way back when the Native Americans lived here.  Then came the cowboys and folks cuttin' wood,  they used it for grazin' and choppin' wood.\n\nSo, I was thinkin', what if someone wanted to turn this land back into a farm,  but somethin' special,  organic and good for the critters too?  Well, it ain't gonna be cheap,  takes more work than just throwin' chemicals around.  But, there's all sorts of programs to help folks out,  like hand outs from the government.\n\nThey got this big plan for keepin' all the critters alive,  even the rare ones.  Seems like a lotta work,  plantin' all sorts of stuff to keep the animals happy,  but it's good for the land.\n\nNow, this organic farm I found nearby,  they're doin' it right.  They're makin' money and keepin' the wildlife happy.  It shows ya,  you can do good and make a buck at the same time.",
            "Listen up, folks! You know how everyone's always talkin' 'bout culture? Well, lemme tell ya, it ain't just some fancy word.  It's like, the way folks do things, their beliefs, y'know?  \n\nNow, don't go thinkin' all Russians are stubborn or all Japanese are nice. That's just plain wrong!  Culture ain't a one-size-fits-all kinda thing. It's more like, understandin' why people do what they do, especially when you're tryin' to work somethin' out with 'em.\n\nWhen you meet folks from a different place, it's kinda like lookin' in a mirror, seein' yourself a little bit, but different. You gotta learn their ways, like their history and what makes 'em tick.\n\nDon't go judgin' 'em or tryin' to change 'em, just respect their ways and work with 'em.  Especially if you're the one needin' somethin' from 'em.  Treat 'em right, be polite, and you'll get further than tryin' to bulldoze your way through.\n\nNow, culture ain't just 'bout countries, either. It's about companies too. Some places work hard, others take it easy. Some got fancy dress codes, others are more casual. It's all part of the culture.\n\nValues are even more important, 'cause they tell you why folks do what they do. If they value respect, you gotta be respectful.  If they're all about gettin' a good deal, you gotta be ready to haggle.\n\nSo, before you sit down at the table, do your homework. Learn about the folks you're dealin' with, their culture, their values.  And remember, treat 'em right, and you'll be halfway there.",
            "Alright, so these two fellas, St. Anselm and St. Thomas, both think God exists.  They both gotta prove it though, right? So, let's just assume they're both right about God, the God from the Bible, 'cause that's what they're talkin' about.\n\nNow, Anselm, he's all about faith, you know? He says you gotta look inside yourself to find God. He's sayin' that since we can even think about God, He must be real. It's kinda like knowin' you need a missing piece to a puzzle, even if you can't see it yet. Anselm says God's like that missing piece, we just know He's there.\n\nBut Thomas, he's a different breed. He wants to prove God with facts, ya know, stuff you can see and touch. He says there are five good reasons why God has to exist, like how everything changes, how things have a cause, and how there are different levels of good and bad. He's sayin' it's all just plain logic, like math, that proves God is real.\n\nSo, both these guys make some good points, but neither one really nails it down for me. They both kinda take a shortcut, ya know? Anselm just assumes we know God's there, and Thomas tries to prove it with logic, but that ain't always foolproof.",
            "So there was this prince, way back in the day, like way back, fifth or sixth century BCE,  who turned into this big deal, Buddha.  He was all about ditching the fancy life and figuring things out, and what he learned became Buddhism.  Now, this Buddhism thing, it's been around for like 2,500 years, and it ain't the same as when Buddha was kickin' around.  Take Sri Lanka, for instance, they got this water-cutting ceremony every year. Monks and regular folks do it, and it's kinda important to them, even though Buddha never mentioned nothin' about it.  See, Buddhism has changed a lot, from the little stuff to the big ideas.  All the monks and regular folks, they've had to tweak their beliefs over time.  Why? Well, things happen, both good and bad, from inside and outside the religion.\n\nLet's get this straight, we're gonna be talkin' about \"inside\" and \"outside,\" \"good\" and \"bad,\" ya know, like that.  Inside stuff comes from folks who are already Buddhists, doesn't matter if they're monks or not.  Outside stuff comes from folks who ain't Buddhists.  Anything that hurts Buddhism is bad, like someone tryin' to tear it down.  And anything that doesn't really care, well, that's neutral, good or bad, depends on the outcome.\n\nNow, let's talk about what Buddhists believe. They go for the triple gem: Buddha, the teachings, and the community.  The teachings are all in these books called the Tripitaka:  The Sutta Pitaka has Buddha's talks, the Vinaya Pitaka has the rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka has the deep stuff about how things work. They talk about no soul (Anatta), life is suffering (Dukkha), and everything changes (Anicca).  Gotta understand these things to get outta the cycle of death and rebirth (Sansara).  And when you get outta that cycle, you get rid of desire (lobha), hate (dosa), and delusion (moha), and become enlightened.  The Vinaya Pitaka tells you how to live. Lay folks have five rules, like don't kill, don't lie, don't steal, and so on. Monks have a whole bunch more rules to follow.\n\nThe big idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. First, life is suffering (Dukkha). Second, suffering comes from wanting things (attachment). Third, suffering can stop. Fourth, there's a way to stop suffering.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya, the US and Mexico, they used to be at each other's throats somethin' fierce! Went on for a good 57 years, from way back in 1836 to 1893.  You know, kinda like those feuds ya hear about down south, but on a bigger scale. The biggest fight was back in 1846, the Mexican-American War.  We jumped on Mexico and took their land, Texas and the Southwest, somethin' fierce!  They had a few other run-ins along the way, but finally calmed down just before the First World War.\n\nSee, it all started because these two countries had some real differences,  like religion, culture, how things were done - you know, the usual stuff. And they both wanted the same stuff, makin' things even hotter. Kinda like how neighbors sometimes fight over the fence line.\n\nIt ain't just the US and Mexico either. Lots of countries that share a border end up buttin' heads.  They're close, which means they're always gettin' in each other's way.  Heck, some folks say the US has more problems with Mexico and Cuba than any other country in Latin America.\n\nReligion was a big part of it too.  Back then, Americans weren't too fond of Catholics and Kings, just like they weren't too keen on Communism and Fascism later on. It was all about what ya believed and who was runnin' things. Just like how the US and Russia were at odds during the Cold War, but instead of politics, it was religion that was the main problem.  And it all went back to those old days when the English and Spanish were always fightin'.\n\nThey had a whole bunch of arguments over the years, somethin' like 17!  Most of them were about land, with people crossin' the border and causin' trouble.  Fence-mendin' time, ya know?  \n\nBut eventually, Mexico started dependin' on the US for a lot of stuff, and that kinda cooled things down.  By the late 1800s, the US was more interested in business than in taking more land, so they finally settled down.",
            "Fifteen years ago, things went south for me. I got sick.   A real nasty one, out of nowhere.  See, I was a nurse, always dreamt of being a scientist or a writer, but everyone told me to be a nurse, said it was safe, always in demand.  So, here I was, 46, single, broke, and couldn't work.  Been on disability ever since,  15 years now.  Can't say I own much of anything.  Every day's a struggle, gotta fight for my security, for my sanity.  Nothing's certain anymore, but one thing's for sure: I couldn't have made it this far without my family and a few good friends.  When life throws you a curveball, you realize just how strong you are, or ain't.\n\n\nMy point is, life throws curveballs, big and small.  You can plan for some, but some things are just too big to handle alone.  Now, I get folks talkin' about smaller government, and Lord knows, it ain't exactly runnin' smooth these days. But instead of everyone building their own bunkers, I say we start trustin' each other again.  Helpin' out, ask for help when you need it.\n\nThey say America was built on rugged individualism, but that ain't the whole story.  Our forefathers got through tough times 'cause they looked out for each other, shared what they had, cared for one another.  Those pioneers crossin' the Rockies, they didn't make it alone, did they?\n\nSo, be prepared, I am. Got my disaster kit, first aid stuff, water purification tablets, even plastic sheeting for the windows if we ever get hit with somethin' nasty.  Got flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, and a pantry full of canned goods.  If you got the space, grow your own food, can it, pickle it, whatever.  Wood stove's a good idea too, if you ain't livin' in an apartment.\n\nBut here's the thing:  while you're stockin' up, get to know your neighbors. That's what truly matters.",
            "So, ya know how creatures change over time, right?  Like, why do they become the way they are?  Is there some kinda rulebook for how they gotta evolve? Back in '17, some fella named Thompson said even figuring out the simplest animal in math words was harder than it looked. And today, well, it's still tough!\n\nBut folks are tryin'.  They're usin' math to figure out how seashells, like those spiral kinda ones, grow and change over time.  They're usin' fancy computer programs and pictures of shells to see what shapes they *could* make, and then tryin' to figure out how those shapes actually happened in real life.\n\nThink of a seashell like a little tube windin' around and around. Each loop is called a whorl, and they all go around a center line called the columella.  \n\nThese whorls can get bigger or smaller, and there's a line called a suture between each one.  Usually, the biggest whorl is the last one, and all the rest are called the spire.  The pointy end of the spire is the apex, and the other end, well, that's the base.  And there's a hole called the aperture where the critter lives.\n\nSo, these scientists are tryin' to figure out how all these parts work together to make a shell, and how they change over time. They're usin' math to see what's possible and then tryin' to figure out how those possibilities come true in nature.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya somethin' about these numbers in Indonesia.  \n\nFor the last ten years, babies ain't been doin' so hot.  They ain't dyin' off at a crazy rate, but they ain't gettin' any healthier neither.  Indonesia's doin' okay on some stuff, like gettin' clean water and toilets, but when it comes to moms and babies, they ain't doin' so hot.  They gotta step it up if they wanna meet their goals by 2015.\n\nSee, they're sayin' more babies are bein' born with a doctor or midwife around, which sounds good, right?  Well, not so fast.  A lot of these midwives ain't really trained to handle anythin' serious, so when somethin' goes wrong, well, it ain't good.  That's why so many moms are dyin' from bleedin' out.  \n\nAnd here's another thing: less kids are gettin' help when they're sick, especially with the tummy bugs.  And what about after the baby's born?  Nobody's really keepin' track of that, but it ain't lookin' good.  \n\nThey ain't doin' enough cesarean sections either.  Only 4% of the time.  Now, in the cities, it's 7%, but in the country, it's only 2%.  That tells ya somethin', don't it?  Healthcare ain't reachin' everyone.  It's like the rich folks get all the good stuff and the poor folks are left behind.\n\nSo, what's the answer?  Should they just focus on fixin' one problem at a time, or should they just make the whole healthcare system better?  Well, it's a tough call.  \n\nProgram-specific stuff sounds good, cuz it's easier to see what's workin' and what ain't.  But you know what? Sometimes that means they'll forget about other stuff and everyone'll be tryin' to grab money for their own program.  Plus, it gets confusing with so many different programs doin' the same thing.",
            "Alright, listen up. These fancy Victorian books, they're all about the little details and the rich folks back in the day. But then you got these two, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" they're different kinda beasts. They're like, \"Let's throw in some mystery and some crazy stuff,\" ya know?  It ain't your typical Victorian novel.  This mystery stuff, it makes the characters come alive, ya see? It shows you what they're really thinkin' and feelin'. \n\nTake this part from \"Oliver Twist,\" for instance:\n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\nThese books use mystery, like dreams or somethin', to show you what's goin' on inside their characters.  Like with Oliver, these weird happenings, they show ya what's botherin' him, what he's really seein' in this messed up world. When they finally revisit the shootin' of Oliver, he relives it in his head, like a bad dream. He's tryin' to find help, but it's like he's stuck, ya know? The passage shows how Oliver's got no control over nothin'. He's in bad shape, seein' things, and these hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit are just makin' it worse.  The shootin' just overwhelms him. He can't even feel the pain, it's constant. It's all just fear now. You gotta wonder who's really behind all this bad luck, 'cause it ain't Oliver. This shootin' shows how powerless Oliver really is. He can't even try to stop it, not even when his life is on the line. It's like Old Fagin's broken him, made him give up, ya know?\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.\"",
            "A couple years back, I was workin' at this after-school program, helpin' out those little rugrats with their schoolwork. I was pretty good at English and readin', so I mostly helped out with those. This one kid, Adrian, maybe third or fourth grade, was givin' me fits.  Seemed like he couldn't read worth a lick. He'd nail some words, then totally botch others, real strange. Now, I knew he was Latino, and he spoke perfect English, so it was confusing as heck. \n\nWe were strugglin' to get anywhere when his momma came in one day. Now, she didn't speak a lick of English, only Spanish.  Me, I was just learnin' a few words myself, but we managed to communicate somehow. And then it hit me, like a ton of bricks! Adrian could read fine, he just didn't know the English alphabet that well.  \n\nI don't know if that helped him much, but I hope he's doin' better now. \n\nThat's why I'm talkin' about this language barrier in schools, especially here in California. It ain't always as obvious as ya think. Even if a kid speaks English, readin' it can still be a real struggle. \n\nWe all know this problem exists, so what do we do about it? For Adrian, it was simple:  help him with the English alphabet and pronunciation. But for kids who barely speak English, it's way more complicated. Ain't no one-size-fits-all answer.  Dual language programs,  immersion, private tutors, ESL classes, none of it works solo. We gotta combine 'em all!\n\nFirst off, dual language programs are a good idea, not just for Spanish speakers, but for everyone. You know, kids in those programs do better in school. Some folks are scared, thinkin' it's a waste of money, but that ain't true. \n\nIf we made these programs the norm instead of the exception, everyone would benefit. But how do we do it? We can't make every teacher bilingual, that's crazy talk. But we can have bilingual aides, tutors, whatever ya wanna call 'em, to help out.",
            "Listen, you ever think about why we're all here? I mean, what's the big picture?  Some folks, they go to church or temple, or just try to figure it out on their own.  A lot of us just go along with what our folks taught us, but some, well, they say \"Nah, ain't nothin' out there but what we can see.\" They live for themselves, just their own world, ya know?  And sometimes folks change their minds about all that, what they believe.  No matter what, we're all searchin', tryin' to make sense of it all. We're lookin' for somethin' to guide us, somethin' bigger than ourselves.\n\nMy old man, he always liked cardinals. We were sittin' on the porch, rain hammerin' down, smokin' cigarettes. The gutters were overflowin', and the plants were gettin' soaked. He was lookin' out at the rain, like he was thinkin' about somethin' far away. He'd gotten thinner, his clothes baggy, and his hair was gettin' sparse. He didn't look at me much, just kept starin' at that rain. I felt lost, scared, but I couldn't bring myself to talk about missin' him. It would just make it too real.  So I hugged him, sat back down, and just watched the rain with him.\n\nHe kicked the bucket that December, just five days after I turned 22. The chemo and radiation kept him alive longer than the doctors thought, but it didn't stop the pain. I couldn't figure out what good it did.  If there's a God out there, I thought, he ain't listenin' to me anymore.\n\nI didn't wanna watch him die. I just couldn't. I wanted to remember him how he was, not how he went. Besides, I knew him better than anyone else. I knew he wouldn't want me there watchin' him fade away. So I hid in my bed for three days, waitin' for the news.\n\nNobody even called.",
            "Alright, so this \"Gothic Novel\" thing, it's a real head-scratcher, kinda like when you try to figure out what your Uncle Bubba's talkin' about. This Ian Watt fella, he calls it an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" which means it's both old and new at the same time.  People have been trashin' it, praisin' it, sayin' it's got no depth, then turnin' around and sayin' it's got this \"terrible sublime\" thing goin' on.  That's what Burke said, anyway.  See, this first \"Gothic Novel,\" \"The Castle of Otranto\" by Horace Walpole, it took bits and pieces from those ol' romances and those newfangled novels and mixed 'em together. He called it a \"Gothic Story.\" Kinda like how I like to mix up a good ol' fashioned whiskey with a splash of somethin' sweet.\n\nWalpole, he used all this stuff from old theater and tried to make it fit with the new way of writin' novels. He wanted people to get inside the characters' heads, you know? That's what makes Gothic novels stick around so long, even though they're old as dirt. It's like wearin' your grandpa's boots - they're old, but they still work!\n\nOne of the big things in Gothic novels is this \"Chivalry\" thing. Back in the day, they had these knights, all brave and honorable, and that's what folks were tryin' to be like. But these writers, like Walpole, they thought folks weren't so chivalrous anymore. So they wrote about these knights to make folks remember what they'd lost.\n\nWalpole, he was worried about the world back then, there was a lot of trouble goin' on. Maybe he thought folks had forgotten how to be good, you know? He put that idea into his stories, especially in this character, Frederic. This Frederic fella, he was like a knight outta a fairytale: he was a prince, he'd been through some bad stuff, and everyone thought he was dead.  He's like the poster boy for chivalry, but maybe a little too perfect, kinda like that guy at the gym who's always showin' off.",
            "Alright, so let me tell ya 'bout this thing called supply chain management.  It's like, how ya get stuff from when someone wants it, all the way back to where it started, you know?  This fella, Keith Oliver, came up with the name back in '82. He figured out it's all 'bout makin' sure you get what folks want, fast and cheap.  \n\nNow, there's six big parts to this whole shebang: makin' the stuff, gettin' the stuff, keepin' track of the stuff, knowin' where the stuff is, movin' the stuff, and talkin' 'bout the stuff.  Basically, you gotta do all these things right to keep your customers happy.\n\nFirst off, ya gotta make the stuff. That's the heart of it all.  Gotta figure out what folks want, when they want it, how much they want, and where to make it.  You gotta watch the market, see what people are buyin', and then decide what to build.  Like, if everyone's buyin' red pickup trucks, ya better be makin' red pickup trucks!  \n\nThen ya gotta figure out where to build 'em.  You gotta think about the best place to make the stuff,  keepin' in mind how much it costs and how good it has to be.  After that, ya gotta make a plan for makin' the stuff, makin' sure the machines are workin' right and the workers know what they're doin'.\n\nNext up is gettin' all the parts you need.  You might have different places makin' different parts, like one place for the engines and another for the seats.  Ya gotta make sure all those parts get to the right place at the right time.  Sometimes, ya might even outsource some stuff to other companies.  That's just a fancy way of sayin' ya hire someone else to make somethin' for ya.  It's like when ya take ya car to the mechanic, ya ain't makin' the car yourself, ya just gettin' someone else to do it.",
            "Well, let me tell ya, this here Ellen Page, she's got a sign, see, sayin' Hitler's alive in Burma.  Burma, that's Myanmar to them fancy folks, is a right mess of a country. They got this mean ol' bunch runnin' things, like a bunch of bullies takin' over the schoolyard.  Back in 2007, some monks, they put on their saffron robes, like a fancy uniform, and started marchin' 'cause they weren't happy.   The government, well, they didn't take too kindly to it.  Got real nasty, started beatin' folks up, even killed some journalists, just plain wrong. \n\nNow, this ain't nothin' new, folks.  Governments tryin' to keep folks in line, stomp on anyone speakin' out, that's been goin' on since the cavemen, I reckon.  The Romans, they thought they were gods, runnin' everything. And them Japanese emperors, they thought they were gods too!  Heck, even our own President, George W. Bush, he talks to some fella named Ted Haggard, who runs a group called Stupid People Worldwide.\n\nYou remember that time in China, back in '89?  They had these folks protestin', students and teachers and all, 'cause they didn't like how the government was runnin' things.  Well, the government got real mad, started shootin' folks.  Nobody knows exactly how many died, but it was a whole lot.  Then there was that Rwandan thing, back in the 90s, where they went after all the Tutsis.  And don't forget about Hitler and his bunch, they rounded up all the Jews and...well, you know.",
            "Duke Ellington, he was a real piano man, and he knew how to make his band sound good. He wasn't always the flashiest player, but he sure knew how to write tunes that showed off his guys. Ellington, he'd set up these frameworks where a musician could really let loose and improvise, and he'd also write these tight, orchestrated parts that made each guy in the band sound their best. It was like he knew exactly what made each guy tick, ya know?  He built this sound, this whole vibe, that was all his own.  People say his stuff was some of the most original and brilliant jazz ever made.\nThis dictionary, the Grove Music one, they say Ellington was always usin' the voice as an instrument. This song, \"Creole Love Call\", it shows what he meant. He used the voice to add this texture and color, without all the fuss of words. And it showed how he could make his soloists shine.  This slow blues song, it's got these six different parts, each one different and special.\n\n\nThe first part, it's like a conversation between the voice and the woodwinds, starts smooth, then gets rougher.  The second part, a trumpet solo, playin' muted,  stretchin' out the melody and addin' these bluesy notes.   The third part, the clarinet takes over, playin' high and sweet, with the piano doin' this subtle, syncopated thing in the background.  The fourth part, the whole band chimes in, like a call and response between the brass and the woodwinds.  The fifth part, that's the big one, the woodwinds callin' and respondin' high and bright, with the brass and rhythm section doin' this stop-time thing, like a heartbeat. Then the last part, it goes back to the first part, the voice and the woodwinds talkin' again, but this time the voice gets all raspy, like it's singin' on its own.  Then there's a little tag at the end, a vocal run and a trombone playin' somethin' kinda dissonant, just for fun.\n\nEllington usin' the voice like that, it's like he was colorin' the whole song.  And this was just one of the things he did. In another song, \"Hot and Bothered\", he takes this muted trumpet player, \"Bubber\" Miley, and this scat singer, Baby Cox, and he makes 'em sound like they're talkin' to each other. It's like the trumpet is singin' and the voice is playin' an instrument.  He did the same thing in \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\", usin' this trombone player, Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, to start the melody in a way that was just perfect.",
            "She always felt like somethin' was missin', you know? Like there was a hole in her life that nothin' could fill. It started when she was about 14, just gettin' into that teenage thing, and it was still there three years later, when she was 17. By then, she figured out she wanted someone, not some shiny new thing. But she just wasn't feelin' it for any boys. Some fellas tried to woo her, all awkward and shy, but nothin' ever clicked. She'd wrack her brain, tryin' to figure out why she felt this way, a plain ol' teenage girl with no interest in fellas.  She had a few theories, but nothin' stuck. So she just kept livin', always wonderin' about this feelin' inside her. \n\nNow, her folks were good people, calm and quiet. They never fought, and she hardly ever got in trouble with 'em. The only time they butted heads was when she tried to act like she was all grown up. She was a sweet kid, but she had a big, boisterous personality that stood out against her parents' laid-back vibes. It made her likeable, though. Everyone liked her.\n\nThis day, though, wasn't one of those calm days. She was moseyin' around the house, lookin' for somethin' to get her goin', when she heard a yelp from the kitchen. It was her mama, and she sounded hurt. She ran in, panickin', \"Mom! What's wrong?!\" Her mama was sprawled on the floor, grimachin' and sayin' \"Ow\" between breaths.  She rushed over and put her hand on her mama, tryin' to help. \"Ouch... sweety, I... need you to take me to... the hospital.\"\n\nHer words were choked out, and her daughter knew it was bad. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to meet you.\" Her mama pointed, and her daughter, glad she'd taken those self-defense classes, scooped her mama up and carried her to the car. She laid her down in the back seat and drove like a bat outta hell.\n\nThe hospital smelled like sickness and fear, but she didn't notice. She was too busy lookin' after her mama. She rushed her in, yellin' for help. A bunch of doctors gathered around, and someone wheeled her mama to a bed. They took her away, and her daughter sat there, worry gnawin' at her gut.\n\n\nTurns out, her mama had fallen off a step stool reachin' for somethin' up high.",
            "So, listen up!  This here study wanted to see if eatin' like folks in the Mediterranean, we're talkin' the \"aMed diet,\" would keep ya heart healthy and keep ya from havin' a stroke.  Now, this \"aMed diet\" is like a fancy way of sayin' eat yer fruits, veggies, nuts, and fish, and cut back on the meat and greasy stuff. A little wine's okay too, just don't go overboard. \n\nSee, they done some studies before, and they found that folks who ate like this were less likely to die from heart problems.  They even did a test where they told folks to eat this way, and they lost weight and their cholesterol got better.  But nobody really looked at strokes before.\n\nSo, they got 74,886 women, good lookin' nurses mostly, ages 38 to 63, and asked 'em what they ate for 20 years. They gave these ladies these fancy questionaires,  like \"How much broccoli ya eatin'?\"  They even checked their records to make sure they were tellin' the truth.  They also looked at how much they smoked, if they took vitamins, and if they were usin' hormone stuff after menopause.  \n\nThey figured out that the women who ate more like folks in the Mediterranean were less likely to have a heart attack or a stroke.  Out of all the ladies, 2391 had a heart attack, 1763 had a stroke, and 1077 died from heart problems. The ladies who ate the best were 29% less likely to have a heart attack or stroke.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya, back in '07, this whole country went belly up. Jobs were scarcer than hen's teeth, houses were worth nothin', and even big ol' companies went bust. And guess what? This mess ain't over yet! We gotta figure out what went wrong and how to stop this whole dang train wreck.\n\nSee, it all started with these slick politicians makin' decisions that were about as smart as a possum in a rainstorm. They pressured banks and businesses to give out loans to folks who couldn't afford 'em. It was like pourin' gasoline on a fire, and the whole thing went up in smoke!\n\nNow, there's these fancy organizations called Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. They were supposed to help folks buy homes, but they were gettin' pressured to buy up all these bad loans, pack 'em up like Christmas presents, and sell 'em off to everyone. When folks stopped payin' their mortgages, the whole house of cards came tumblin' down.\n\nThis whole mess started back in the Clinton days. He was tryin' to get re-elected, so he made it easier for folks to get loans, even if they weren't exactly financially stable. Some folks, like this fella Steven Holmes from the New York Times, saw the writing on the wall and warned about what could happen. But nobody listened.\n\nAnd let me tell ya, these newfangled mortgages were somethin' else. They had all these fancy names like \"adjustable-rate mortgages\" and \"collateralized debt obligations.\"  It was like a big ol' tangled mess, and nobody really understood how it all worked.\n\nAll those fancy financial games left folks with more debt than they could handle. And when the housing bubble burst, it was like a bomb goin' off in the economy. Big banks like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers went kaput, and even Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to change their tune. Fannie and Freddie were in deep trouble too, and the government had to step in and bail 'em out.",

We all know the golden rule: \"Show, don't tell.\" But sometimes, even the best of us get caught up in the weeds and end up with too much talkin' and not enough action. That's where exposition comes in—the part of the story where you dump a whole bucket of information on the reader. It's like watching someone tell you a story while they monopolize the entire conversation. \n\nThink of it like this:  You're reading a story and the author goes on and on about how the main character met her hubby, got hitched in a big ol' shindig, and then BAM! He gets whacked right in front of her eyes. Now, nobody wants to read two pages of that, with characters talking like robots and not showing any real emotion. \n\nInstead, the author should give us some juicy details about this hubby fella. Let us see how much he loved his wife through his words and actions. Show us how she changed and grew because of him. Get us invested in his story so that when he meets his maker, we feel the pain along with her.  \n\nWe want the story to have some meat on its bones! We want to be drawn in and feel like we're right there in the middle of it all.",

They lead with this story 'bout this Shad Hostettler fella in Ashley, Ohio. Stabbed his wife good, they said - didn't say her name though.  He looked like a real piece of work, that's for sure. They only gave it couple minutes, seein' as how it was still fresh.  Didn't give too many details, just that he stabbed her a bunch and they got him.  Seemed like about right, y'know?\n\nNext up was this Travis Buyers kid, 18 years old, shot in Sharon Woods.  Critically hurt, they said, and nobody had a clue who did it. SWAT team was on the case.  This one seemed kinda rushed, though.  Makes you wonder, don't it?  Maybe 'cause it was a black kid?  Cause I've noticed, and I'm talkin' for years now, they don't give minorities the same attention when they're in trouble.  If it's a white kid, missing or hurt, they go nuts. But a black kid? Lucky if they even mention it.\n\nThen they had this story about a bullet hole in a Med-Flight helicopter.  .22 caliber, they said, from a rifle.  They were offering five grand for tips, tryin' to catch the shooter.\n\nNext up was the weather, talkin' 'bout rain and thunderstorms comin' Saturday.  They said it'd be in the low eighties all weekend.   Kinda short on that one, like they were just teasin' ya.\n\nThen they had this story 'bout a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road.  Said the guy was a dark-skinned black fella, wearin' a hoodie.  Six foot tall, about one hundred and fifty pounds.  Seemed like they kept goin' on 'bout the color of his skin, don't ya think?\n\nLast one was 'bout this Rene Rodriguez, some big-shot drug dealer from Texas.  They said he was caught sellin' a whole lotta weed to Ohio.  He got 300 months - that's 25 years, for them keepin' score. They even mentioned he was Hispanic.

They see themselves in each other, good and bad.  When things get rough, that's when ya really see what kinda bond they got.  It can be powerful, strong as hell, but it can also hurt like crazy. \n\nThis book, \"The Scarlet Ibis\", it talks about that bond,  the good and the bad.  Two brothers, settin' out on this crazy journey, and it all goes south.   One brother, he's got this pride thing goin' on, thinks he's better than the other.  It's like he wants this perfect brother, someone to match him, ya know?  But the other brother, he's different.  He can't keep up, can't do all the things the older brother wants to do.

Then it was like papyrus, like them old scrolls. Then folks got fancy and said it was like a book. Now, these brainy scientists, they say it's like a computer.

Your brain's got so much goin' on, it can't pay attention to everything. It's like, you see a million blades of grass, but you don't really notice each one. But if someone says your name, bam!

It's all smoke and mirrors, folks.  \n\nHe calls it \"false consciousness,\" like they're dreamin' a dream they think is real.  But the truth is, they're gettin' used, used like a cheap tool.  They're buyin' into a system that ain't doin' nothin' but line the pockets of the fat cats.   \n\nAnd these folks, they ain't even thinkin' 'bout it.  They're too busy chasin' after the next shiny thing, the next pleasure.  They don't even know how to feel real emotions anymore, let alone fight back.   \n\nIt's a sad state of affairs, folks.  And Huxley, he's tryin' to wake us up.  He's sayin' we gotta start thinkin' for ourselves, gotta see through the lies.   We gotta fight for our freedom, or we're gonna end up livin' in a world where we're nothin' but cogs in a machine.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya, this here Uni Park's a right pain in the neck to get around, especially if ya live like me, way out East Halls, where the sun don't shine and the wind blows hard enough to blow ya off your feet.  It's a good thing I ain't got to walk all the way to Willard Buildin' - that's like walkin' from here to Dallas!  Used to be, there was nothin' out there but open fields, but now they're buildin' all sorts of fancy stuff - sports fields, new buildings, even apartments.  Makes ya wonder what's next, a dang rodeo?  Point is, this place keeps gettin' bigger, and harder to navigate.  \n\nNow, I reckon the best way to get around this campus is on a dang bicycle.  But a bicycle ain't gonna do ya no good if nobody's ridin' it, and the campus ain't built for bikes.  \n\nI was talkin' to my buddy the other day, and he said he'd been ridin' again after takin' a break for a few years.  He said, \"Man, why'd I ever stop?  Bikes are the only way to get around these parts.\"  He's right, ya know?  Besides bein' good for ya, they're the fastest way to get from Point A to Point B.  I ain't talkin' 'bout no fancy mountain bike, just a regular ol' bike, and a bowl of grits for breakfast will get ya goin' for 30 miles or more.\n\nI live off campus now, just as far from the center of campus as some of those dorms.  Best thing I did this year was buy a bike.  Used to take me a good 25 minutes to walk to my class in Thomas Buildin'.  Now, whiz on over there in 5 minutes flat if I pedal like the wind.  The only problem is, Pollock Road ain't always the friendliest place for a bike.\n\nWalkin' ain't bad, but I ain't got time for it.  Without my bike, I'd be walkin' to class every day, and that's a whole lotta time wasted.  Think about it, over 2 1/2 hours a week just walkin' to class.  Add that to walkin' to other places, and I ain't got no time for nothin' else."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",

While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

It's like tryin' to hear your grandpa tell a story at a BBQ.\n\nSo, what can you do if you're a teacher and you've got a kid with CAPD in your classroom? Well, there are things you can do to help 'em out.  Like, makin' sure they're sittin' near the front of the room, where they can hear you best.  And speakin' clearly and at a moderate pace.  You might even want to use visual aids, like pictures or diagrams, to help 'em understand.   And remember, patience is key!",
            "Well, lemme tell ya, this play, Twelfth Night, it's sayin' somethin' about how  disguises, they can be handy for foolin' folks for a while. But in the end, you gotta ditch the fake you, or you might just lose yourself for good. \n\nThe tough part is, when you pull off the mask, folks might get all riled up. Some might not care, but others, they'll be miffed that you played 'em for a fool. So you gotta choose: stay true to yourself, or keep the peace with the folks around ya.\n\nAnd this whole pretendin' to be the opposite gender thing? That's a real sticky wicket. Why'd they feel the need to change who they are?  Well, in Viola's case, it's all about survival. She's in a strange land, and she figures pretendin' to be a dude'll keep her safe from getting hurt. It works, but now she's cut off from the other women, missin' out on their support.\n\nAnd get this, she's so good at playin' the part, Olivia, this lady, falls head over heels for her!  It's like, \"Whoa, hold on, I'm a dude!\"  And then there's Orsino, who starts gettin' all gooey over Viola too. It's a tangled mess!\n\nMaybe this play is sayin' that pretendin' can help folks figure out their own feelings, even if they don't wanna admit 'em.  Like Olivia, is she really into Cesario 'cause he's a guy, or is there somethin' else goin' on?  Who knows?\n\nOne thing's for sure, Shakespeare liked to keep things complicated.",
            "Now listen here, this German empire thing, it was a real mixed bag.  Sure, they were meanies in some places, especially to those Ovaherero and Nama folks in South West Africa. That was just plain wrong. But you gotta remember, this ain't no one-size-fits-all story.  Like my buddy who's a little slow, each of their colonies was different, just like people. \n\nThey had some fancy schools in places like East Africa, even when the Brits took over they found a bunch of smart Africans already knowin' their stuff.  But down in South West Africa, it was a whole different tune.\n\nThey didn't care much for teachin' the locals there.  They let the church folks handle it, and those church folks didn't have much money. They did alright by the white folks though, built 'em their own schools and kept a close eye on the church schools too.  \n\nThat messed things up for South West Africa.  While other places were full of smart Africans, South West Africa was left behind.  They didn't get much teachin', most folks couldn't read or write.  There's a lotta reasons for this, gotta dig deep to figure it out.  I'm talkin' about the folks who moved there, the bosses in charge, and the whole economy.\n\nThere's been a lot of talk about this, folks have been writin' about it for years. Mostly in German, back when it was all goin' down.  They mainly just told what schools were like in each place.\n\nLater on, folks in English started comparin' schools all over the place and gettin' into the nitty-gritty of how they worked.  They found out it wasn't all the same, that's for sure.\n\nOne fella, Cohen, he wrote about South West Africa and East Africa. He says that South West Africa had a lot more white folks livin' there, and that's why the schools were so different.\n\nSouth West Africa was a pretty nice place to live, even if it was mostly desert.  There were a lot more white folks there than anywhere else they had colonies.",
            "Man, lemme tell ya, tryin' to figure out what all the different kinds of popular music are is like tryin' to herd cats! You got your rock, your country, your rap, your jazz, heck, even folk music, and each one of 'em has got a whole bunch of little sub-genres sprouted up like weeds. \n\nBut lemme tell ya, heavy metal, that's a whole 'nother ball game! That music's been around for like 40 years, and it's wilder than a bunch of coyotes in a chicken coop. It's got all these different moods, mostly on the darker side, but that's part of what makes it so cool.  \n\nIt's like a big ol' family reunion, with all these different branches and cousins. You got your classic metal, your thrash, your death metal, your doom metal, and a whole bunch more I can't even keep track of. It's like every time you think you've got it figured out, someone comes along and throws a wrench in the works. \n\nNow, you gotta understand, heavy metal ain't just about the music. It's a whole way of life, a movement, if you will. It's about bein' loud, bein' proud, and not bein' afraid to show your true colors. It's about  embracin' the darkness, the chaos, the whole nine yards.\n\nAnd yeah, some folks might say it's all about drugs and violence, and maybe there's a little truth to that. But there's more to it than that, too. It's about expressin' yourself, about findin' your voice, about bein' part of somethin' bigger than yourself. \n\nSo, if you wanna understand heavy metal, you gotta go beyond the surface. You gotta dig deep into the music, into the lyrics, into the heart of the movement. You gotta understand what it means to be a metalhead, to embrace the darkness, to live life on your own terms.",
            "Before them fancy Surrealist painters started makin' their weird dream pictures, this fella Henri Rousseau was busy dreamin' his own dreams, both in his head and on canvas. See, back in 1910, he painted this picture called \"The Dream,\" and it ain't just some lady lookin' at pretty stuff in a dream. It's kinda like Rousseau himself, pourin' his heart out about what he wanted as a painter. This guy, he dreamed big - he wanted folks to notice his art, to like it, to say good things about it. But here's the catch: he was torn. He wanted to be accepted by all the fancy art folks, but he also wanted to be himself, ya know? It was like he had a choice: play by their rules or stick to his own guns. And \"The Dream,\" well, that's him wrestle'n with that choice. \n\nNow, to understand this painting, ya gotta know a little about Rousseau's life. He wasn't born with a silver spoon, wasn't no art prodigy. He worked for the government, collectin' tolls, all while paintin' on the side. Didn't have no formal art training, nothin' fancy like that.  But he was a dreamer, and after his wife and kids passed away, paintin' became his way to escape, to find somethin' new.\n\nHe wanted to be accepted by the art world, and I don't blame him. He started later in life than most, and there were a bunch of other talented artists makin' a name for themselves. He even worked around the same time as Matisse, but they were different cats. Matisse was all about bein' original, breakin' the rules, while Rousseau just wanted to paint somethin' good enough to get noticed.",
            "Lotsa brainy folks think thinkin' 'bout right and wrong is kinda like thinkin' 'bout pretty things - they go together.  You know, like that fella Keats said, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" We learn a lot by goin' to school or doin' stuff, but  we just kinda *get* right and wrong and pretty things, ya know?\n\nIt's not like we're taught how to like good art or do good deeds, it's more like we try to figure out *why* stuff's good or pretty. Like, when we talk about a painting, we might talk about colors and stuff, but that don't really tell ya why it's so dang good.  It's like, \"There's just somethin' about it,\" ya know?  Same with right and wrong - we can talk 'bout rules all day, but it's more than just followin' the rules. \n\nIt's like that writer Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say somethin' that can't be said any other way.\"  No matter how much we talk 'bout a book or a painting, there's always somethin' more to it, somethin' special.  That's what makes 'em so powerful. It's like that \"je ne sais quoi\"  -  that somethin' special that ya can't put your finger on. \n\nI think we feel right and wrong deep down inside, in a way that we can't really explain. It's like a gut feelin'. And that's why art and right and wrong are so connected - they both touch us in a way that words can't always explain.",
            "Germany today is a real powerhouse, a country that's come together with its own unique culture. You can feel it everywhere, from the fancy city of München nestled in the Alps all the way to Kiel by the Baltic Sea. Then there's Köln on the Rhine River, Dresden in Saxony by the Elbe –  it's a blend of history and tradition that makes Germany so special.  It's no surprise that this awesome country has roots from all sorts of different tribes and groups. \n\nThey call the land where the Germans live \"Germania\".  But where did that name come from?  Well, everyone's got their own theory. This guy Tacitus, a writer back in the day, said it came from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians. He figured they were called \"Germans\" before they crossed the Rhine and fought with the Gauls. Then there's Julius Caesar, who used the word \"Germanus\" in his writings about the Gallic Wars. He was fighting the Gauls and these Germanic tribes who kept sneaking across the Rhine. Caesar used the word to tell the difference between who he had conquered (the Gauls) and who he hadn't. Some folks think the Gauls gave him the word, others say it came from a spear the Germans used in battle called a \"ger\".  Maybe it even comes from an old Irish word for \"shout\" because, you know, Germans are known for being loud! \n\nTacitus wrote a book about the origins of the Germans called \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" way back in 98 AD.  He thought the Germans were original folks, not mixed with other races.  He even said, “Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?”\n\nAnd you know who wouldn't go to Germania? The Romans! They'd march in for goods and fight a few battles, but mostly they stayed home in their big empire. So the Germanic tribes hung out on the edges of the Roman world in the 1st century, trading stuff they got from the land and even serving in the Roman army.",
            "Man, I was lookin' at this stuff, all messed up and stuff.  Didn't even know what to think, ya know?  Just lookin' at it, like it was some kinda puzzle I couldn't solve. My mind was runnin', but nothin' was clickin'. It was like watchin' a movie, but I didn't understand the story.\n\nOnce, this artist buddy told me about this book, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" Said it could teach ya how to draw anything.  \n\nHe said if you want to draw somethin' real good, you gotta break it down. Like, if you see a whole room,  just focus on one thing, like a bowl of fruit.  It's like takin' a picture and makin' it smaller, easier to understand.\n\nBut this stuff I was lookin' at, it was too much. I felt like I was staring at somethin' outta this world. Like, Picasso had his blue period, Monet loved flowers, and all those fancy Italian painters, they used every color in the book. I figured, if I was gonna be an artist, I gotta start somewhere. And this, right here, this was my start. My \"Masterpiece in Brown.\"  \n\nI reached out, my hand tremblin' a little, like I was holdin' a magic wand. My mind was sayin' one thing, but my body was doin' somethin' else. The water swirled, lookin' all calm and peaceful. Then, somethin' happened. The brown stuff, it wouldn't budge. It was stuck like glue.\n\nMy heart was beatin' faster now. This wasn't what I had in mind.  I was wearin' this stupid tie, my feet felt funny, and all I could think about was this mess. I was like a waiter at a fancy restaurant, but instead of servin' food, I was servin' up...well, you know.  I took a deep breath, grabbed the mop, and got to work.  I swear, it felt like I was preparin' for a Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya, these young whippersnappers are dyin' behind the wheel somethin' fierce! It's like a recipe for disaster, ya know?  The big brains over at the National Institutes of Health say that their brains ain't quite cooked yet for all the craziness of drivin'. And let's face it, they ain't got much experience either.  That lack of know-how leads to a whole heap of accidents, rollovers, speedin', and even drivin' off the road!\n\nNow, these kids, they love cruisin' around with their buddies, and we all know it.  A bunch of 'em piled in a car is like a recipe for trouble. These brainiacs down in California did a study showin' just how much worse things get when the passenger's a peer.  \n\nThey've tried to fix this by givin' young'uns these temporary licenses that put limits on when they can drive and who they can have in the car. But that's just a band-aid on a bullet hole, if ya ask me.\n\nThe real problem is that these young drivers, statistically speakin', ain't cut out for the road yet.  This fella Zuckerman, a psychologist, says even 18's too young for a real license.  He's done all sorts of research showin' that young folks, 19 and under, just crave that thrill, that rush.  Waitin' a bit longer, until they calm down a bit, might be a good idea.\n\nWe keep givin' 'em licenses, we're gonna see more and more young folks gettin' hurt. With all those baby boomers' kids turnin' 16 soon, we're lookin' at a real catastrophe on the roads.  \n\nHere's what we gotta do:  Keep teachin' 'em in school, but no one under 18 gets behind the wheel. We can still have those learner's permits and all that, and they gotta get their hours in with a grown-up.  California, they already do 6 hours of drivin' with an instructor and 50 hours with a parent or somethin'.\n\nWe need a nationwide law on this, somethin' that protects everyone.  It ain't a new idea, but it's a darn good one.",
            "Listen, I was lookin' at these old Edison movies, you know, the ones from way back in the day,  like before World War I. There were fifteen of these \"trick\" movies, and they were all about pullin' the wool over your eyes. They use some fancy cuttin' and whatnot to make things look like magic. I tried to figure out how these movies worked, ya know, like the rules of the game. Most of 'em are pretty basic, like they were filmed on a stage. The camera never moves, it just sits there like it's watchin' a play. And the actors, they only move back and forth, never towards or away from the camera. Like somethin' outta  those old vaudeville shows.  They even stick to these long shots, like you're way back in the audience. No close-ups, not even once.  \n\nAnd the whole thing is like one big trick, ya see? Each trick is like one whole movie, only a minute or so long. They just gotta get the trick done quick, like a magic show. But don't let that fool ya, sometimes they'll stitch together a bunch of little shots to make it look like somethin' disappeared or somethin'. Watch this one, \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" from way back in 1895.  It looks like one shot, but if you look real close, you'll see where they switch things out.  Sneaky, huh?",
            "Now listen here folks, this John Taylor fella, he was a real firebrand when it came to bein' a Republican.  Worked the land himself,  but that didn't stop him from talkin' up his beliefs, loud and clear.  He was all about folks being free to do their own thing, especially when it came to runnin' their own farms.  That's what drove his whole outlook on government, see?  He figured  the government was best when it kept its nose out of folks' business and let 'em get on with their lives.\n\nJohn Taylor, he thought America had a chance to build somethin' real special, somethin' that hadn't been done before.  He felt like we were startin' fresh, with no old ways holdin' us back.  He believed folks were born with rights, you know,  rights that couldn't be messed with by the government.  He figured if you take away one right,  they all start to crumble.\n\nTo make this dream work, Taylor thought the government had to be built right. He knew folks are good and bad, so the government had to keep both sides in check.  He was a straight shooter,  believed there was right and wrong,  and he thought the government should stick to what's right.  He felt a good government protects your property, helps farmers, and doesn't get too big for its britches.  He believed folks would always look out for themselves, but that's not always a bad thing if it helps the whole country.  \n\nTaylor, like a lot of his Republican buddies, believed the Constitution should be read exactly as it was written.  He didn't want the government gettin' too powerful,  costin' too much money,  or bossin' folks around.  But he also knew you gotta understand what the folks who wrote it meant,  not just read the words on the page.  He even thought the Declaration of Independence was more important 'cause it talked about states bein' independent, not just one big country.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya, seein' that chart in Figure 17, it was like  someone pulled the plug on those commuter logs in the third month.  Kinda bummed me out,  I gotta say.  Hard to figure out why folks stopped fillin' 'em out.  You know, up here in New England, when winter hits, folks ain't walkin' or bikin' much anymore.  That could explain some of it, I reckon.  December's also when the semester's endin' and everyone's runnin' around tryin' to finish their work, get their grades, and all that jazz.  Maybe the log just slipped their minds.  And then there's the holidays, man.  It's a whole month long break for students and teachers, nobody's even on campus most of the time!  Then school starts back up in January, and that might explain why there weren't many logs then either.  But nothin' explains why February was so slow.\n\nI guess folks get all excited about new projects at first, then the fire dies down, ya know?  So we tried to crank things up again with a special \"Carpool Challenge Week\" in March, and that brought the logs back up a bit.  We learned that keepin' folks engaged is tough, especially with all the holidays and breaks in academia. \n\nAnother thing, folks love their cars.  It's just part of our American way of life.  So, we gotta give 'em somethin' good to switch over, ya know?  We gave away all sorts of prizes, gift cards to restaurants, coffee shops, massage places, even the bookstore.  I wonder though, if we'd given away some real big prizes, like a new bike, a hybrid car, or even an electric one, would that've gotten more folks involved?  Maybe it would've stopped that dip in the logs.  \n\nWe kept the prizes the same throughout the whole project.  But what if we'd upped the ante?  Maybe if we'd announced some fancy bikes in December, and then a hybrid or electric car in January, folks would've been more motivated to log their commutes.",
            "Well shoot, lemme tell ya 'bout these fancy things called ETFs. They're kinda like those index funds, but you can buy 'em and sell 'em like regular ol' stocks. Think of it like this: you want to own a piece of the whole stock market, but you don't wanna pick out each stock yourself. An ETF does that for ya, like a big ol' basket of stocks all wrapped up in one.\n\nThey're cheaper than those mutual funds, and you can buy just a single share, not like some of them funds where you gotta put down a whole truckload of cash.  But here's the kicker: you gotta pay a fee every time you buy or sell, just like with regular stocks.\n\nNow, there's all sorts of ETFs out there, trackin' different things, like the whole market, certain industries, even somethin' called \"hot dogs\" if you believe it! This here one, IHF, is trackin' a bunch of different companies, but lemme tell ya, most of it's tied up in just ten of 'em.\n\nSo I figured, why not just buy those ten companies straight up? See if it's better than buyin' the whole ETF. Turns out, usin' just those ten companies, I might get a better return, and it might even be a little less risky. \n\nNow, I ain't no fancy Wall Street fella, but I reckon it's always good to double-check the numbers.  See if what they're sayin' about diversification and all that jazz is really true.",
            "So, Poe thought this poem, \"Dream-Land\", was pretty darn good. You see, he uses this word \"Thulé\" twice in it, and this guy named Mabbott figured out that Poe got it from Virgil. Virgil, way back when, used \"Thulé\" to talk about an island way up north, like the edge of the world back then. Now, Virgil probably used it first, but Poe was a big fan of German writers, ya know?\n\nOne of these German fellas, Goethe, wrote this poem called \"The King of Thulé\". It's about a king who loses his wife and goes totally bonkers, drinking like crazy and moping around. He ends up giving away all his stuff and throwing himself off a cliff. Sound familiar?  Some smart guy, Karl J. Arndt, said Poe's poem and Goethe's are kinda alike, like Poe was copying him. \n\nGoethe was a big deal back in the day, wrote this famous play called \"Faust\", the first part came out in 1808 and the second one when he died in 1832.  And in the second part of \"Faust\", there's this short poem called \"The King of Thulé\", which is about that same sad king who throws himself off a cliff.  Poe used \"Thulé\" twice in his poems, once in \"Dream-Land\" and once in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\".  Some folks say these two poems, Poe's and Goethe's, they kinda go together. Poe's poem is about this dark and lonely place, haunted by dead friends, just like Goethe's king.\n\nPoe liked Tennyson, and Goethe was a big deal even back then. Poe probably knew about him because everybody was talking about him.",
            "So, lemme ask ya somethin'. This gal, Jennifer, she tripped and fell in a grocery store because some dang applesauce was spilled on the floor. Now, the store manager, this Martin fella, knew about the spill twice before Jennifer went down. But he was too busy eatin' his dinner to clean it up for half an hour! Can Jennifer sue for extra money, ya know, like punishin' the store for bein' so dang careless? \n\nWell, the judge ain't gonna just toss her claim out the window right away.  To get that extra money, Jennifer gotta prove that Martin knew darn well folks could get hurt from that spill, but he just didn't care. She also gotta show he was a real jerk about it.\n\nJennifer can say that Martin shoulda known better 'cause folks had been slipin' and fallin' on spills all year!  Even though he knew this, he still ignored the problem.\n\nNow, sayin' Martin was a real bad apple might be a stretch, but it ain't outta line, ya know?  Six folks had already busted their tails fallin' in that store that year!\n\nHere's the story: This employee, Rich, told Martin about the applesauce spill at 5 pm. Martin said he was on break and didn't wanna deal with it. Then another worker, Mary, told Martin about the spill again at 5:15 pm, but he said the same thing.  At 5:30 pm, Jennifer went down and hurt her back somethin' fierce!\n\nNow, Jennifer's sayin' D&D should pay for her injuries, both for the hurtin' she done and for bein' so dang negligent.  And we gotta figure out if we should ask the judge to throw out the part about punative damages.\n\nSee, in California, you can get extra money if a company acts real bad, even if there ain't no contract involved. They gotta have done somethin' mean, like cheat folks or act with malice.  Malice means they either wanted to hurt folks or they were so dang reckless that they knew they were gonna hurt someone, but didn't care. That's what Jennifer's tryin' to prove with Martin and that applesauce.",
            "So, lemme tell ya somethin'. I took this Islam class, like four years ago, at CBC. One thing we argued about a lot was if Islam was a bad religion, ya know? And now, more than ever, that question feels important. Think about it, after 9/11, the news went from sayin' Islam was bad to sayin' it's totally cool. I mean, could you imagine back in 2001 havin' a prez candidate named Barack Obama, with that Muslim family history? Not a chance!\n\nNow, this book about Muhammad, the prophet, it got me thinkin'. I always thought Muhammad was a kinda tough guy, ya know, conquerin' tribes and makin' 'em turn Muslim. But this book paints him as this martyr, misunderstood, even humble. Like, people came to him on their own, seein' the truth in his words. Kinda makes ya wonder, huh?\n\nAnd listen, this book makes Muhammad sound a lot like Jesus. Take that story about him turnin' a little mutton and milk into enough for forty guys. It's like they're tryin' to make Muhammad look like some kinda miracle worker, just like Jesus. It's kinda sneaky, ya know? Like they're tryin' to steal Jesus' thunder!\n\nThey also got these stories about how people converted to Islam all on their own. But a lot of 'em come from second-hand stories, like \"So-and-so told me, who heard it from so-and-so.\" That kinda stuff makes it sound fishy to me.\n\nBut the worst part is, they try to make Muhammad out to be this perfect man, humble and wise. But history says somethin' different. I gotta wonder if Muslims today even know the real story about how Muhammad got so powerful.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya somethin'.  You see, the way folks been talkin' 'bout Jesus these days ain't nothin' like what he was really preachin'. It's like they got off track, ya know?  Seems like the world's gettin' more open-minded,  makin' progress and all that.  But you still got those old-timers, stuck in their ways,  refusin' to budge.  But they ain't gonna change nothin'. \n\nNow, I reckon folks are gonna start thinkin' 'bout the real Jesus, what he truly meant. They're gonna want to peel back all the layers of stuff that got added over the years. It might take a while, maybe even a long time, but it'll happen.  We're talkin' a whole turnaround, like turnin' back the clock.\n\nFolks are gonna start followin' Jesus like it's the good old days, just his words, nothin' else. The church might still be there, leadin' the way, but it won't be the same.  Everyone's gonna be thinkin' alike, with the same beliefs and doin' things the same way.  \n\nHistory's full of these big changes. Remember when Christians were gettin' persecuted by the Romans?  Then they turned around and became Christians themselves!  Same thing happened here in our country, went from slavery to black folks leadin' the way. \n\nThis whole thing, it's gonna happen in the church too, goin' back to the roots, forgettin' all the extra stuff. And it's gonna be like readin' Jesus' words in a new way, not takin' everything so literally.\n\nSo, what happened since Jesus walked the earth?  Well, it all started with Judaism, the foundation of Christianity.  They believed in only one God, had their scriptures, the whole shebang.  But even then, they weren't all on the same page, split into different groups, like the Sadducees, Pharisees, and those crazy Zealots.",
            "Look, I reckon \"The Jungle\" shows folks are pretty darn greedy, you know? Deep down, they just wanna look out for number one, make their own lives easier, and don't give a hoot about nobody else, especially not the little guy. The book makes that plain as day. \n\nTake them factory owners and bosses, for instance. All they care about is makin' their factories big and fancy, makin' as much dough as they can. They don't give a lick about anyone gettin' hurt or messed up along the way.\n\nUpton Sinclair, he writes about how the factories are like these big, ugly beasts, all black and smokin', spewin' out pollution like it's nothin'. He's tryin' to show how these factory owners just don't care about the people or the animals, just about makin' money. They don't care about the smoke chokin' the air or the mess they're makin' with all the animal waste runnin' around.\n\nAnd the bosses, they don't care about their workers neither. They'll squeeze every penny they can out of 'em, work 'em till they drop, and then lay 'em off without a second thought. Back then, there weren't no laws protectin' workers, so they could get away with anything. It was a dog-eat-dog world, and the workers were the ones gettin' eaten.\n\nSinclair says the workers were like slaves, treated worse than dirt. They had no say in nothin', no way to fight back. They were stuck in this awful system, workin' themselves to the bone just to survive.",

He uses all sorts of tricks, like pairing words together that don't usually go together, kinda like sayin' \"purple polka-dotted toaster\" - it just makes ya stop and think, ya know? And he's real good at usin' symbols too, like colors.  He takes a color, gives it a meaning, then uses it again and again to make ya think of that same feelin'. \n\nHe's got this whole thing goin' on with colors like gold, green, white, and red.  But the ones he uses the most are white and gray - 'specially white and gray.  He uses 'em to show that somethin' ain't nothin' special, like a bunch of folks all wearin' the same clothes.\n\nSee, white for Fitzgerald means somethin' kinda fancy and nice, like Daisy, she's always in white, even when she's dressin' up for Gatsby's big parties.   But gray, well, that's more like somethin' old and faded, like them big apartment buildings Nick sees in the city.  He uses these colors to show how folks are all the same, like they're parts of a big ol' machine.\n\nThen, when Fitzgerald wants ya to think somethin' ain't important, he uses white and gray for it. He does this with Daisy, for example. After a while, when he keeps describin' her in these colors, she starts to seem less like a person and more like somethin' to be owned, like a fancy car or a piece of jewelry.\n\nSo, Fitzgerald's playin' with colors to make ya feel somethin' specific, like Daisy ain't just a woman, but somethin' more like an idea - somethin' predictable and kinda empty.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya about this little piece of land in San Diego.  It's a real gem.  Sun's always shinin', folks grow all sorts of good eatin' there – tomatoes, citrus, you name it.  Even got folks growin' stuff organic,  they're sellin' it faster than a politician promises a tax cut!\n\nNow, this here land, it's got a history,  been around since way back when the Native Americans lived here.  Then came the cowboys and folks cuttin' wood,  they used it for grazin' and choppin' wood.\n\nSo, I was thinkin', what if someone wanted to turn this land back into a farm,  but somethin' special,  organic and good for the critters too?  Well, it ain't gonna be cheap,  takes more work than just throwin' chemicals around.  But, there's all sorts of programs to help folks out,  like hand outs from the government.\n\nThey got this big plan for keepin' all the critters alive,  even the rare ones.  Seems like a lotta work,  plantin' all sorts of stuff to keep the animals happy,  but it's good for the land.\n\nNow, this organic farm I found nearby,  they're doin' it right.  They're makin' money and keepin' the wildlife happy.  It shows ya,  you can do good and make a buck at the same time.",
            "Listen up, folks! You know how everyone's always talkin' 'bout culture? Well, lemme tell ya, it ain't just some fancy word.  It's like, the way folks do things, their beliefs, y'know?  \n\nNow, don't go thinkin' all Russians are stubborn or all Japanese are nice. That's just plain wrong!  Culture ain't a one-size-fits-all kinda thing. It's more like, understandin' why people do what they do, especially when you're tryin' to work somethin' out with 'em.\n\nWhen you meet folks from a different place, it's kinda like lookin' in a mirror, seein' yourself a little bit, but different. You gotta learn their ways, like their history and what makes 'em tick.\n\nDon't go judgin' 'em or tryin' to change 'em, just respect their ways and work with 'em.  Especially if you're the one needin' somethin' from 'em.  Treat 'em right, be polite, and you'll get further than tryin' to bulldoze your way through.\n\nNow, culture ain't just 'bout countries, either. It's about companies too. Some places work hard, others take it easy. Some got fancy dress codes, others are more casual. It's all part of the culture.\n\nValues are even more important, 'cause they tell you why folks do what they do. If they value respect, you gotta be respectful.  If they're all about gettin' a good deal, you gotta be ready to haggle.\n\nSo, before you sit down at the table, do your homework. Learn about the folks you're dealin' with, their culture, their values.  And remember, treat 'em right, and you'll be halfway there.",
            "Alright, so these two fellas, St. Anselm and St. Thomas, both think God exists.  They both gotta prove it though, right? So, let's just assume they're both right about God, the God from the Bible, 'cause that's what they're talkin' about.\n\nNow, Anselm, he's all about faith, you know? He says you gotta look inside yourself to find God. He's sayin' that since we can even think about God, He must be real. It's kinda like knowin' you need a missing piece to a puzzle, even if you can't see it yet. Anselm says God's like that missing piece, we just know He's there.\n\nBut Thomas, he's a different breed. He wants to prove God with facts, ya know, stuff you can see and touch. He says there are five good reasons why God has to exist, like how everything changes, how things have a cause, and how there are different levels of good and bad. He's sayin' it's all just plain logic, like math, that proves God is real.\n\nSo, both these guys make some good points, but neither one really nails it down for me. They both kinda take a shortcut, ya know? Anselm just assumes we know God's there, and Thomas tries to prove it with logic, but that ain't always foolproof.",
            "So there was this prince, way back in the day, like way back, fifth or sixth century BCE,  who turned into this big deal, Buddha.  He was all about ditching the fancy life and figuring things out, and what he learned became Buddhism.  Now, this Buddhism thing, it's been around for like 2,500 years, and it ain't the same as when Buddha was kickin' around.  Take Sri Lanka, for instance, they got this water-cutting ceremony every year. Monks and regular folks do it, and it's kinda important to them, even though Buddha never mentioned nothin' about it.  See, Buddhism has changed a lot, from the little stuff to the big ideas.  All the monks and regular folks, they've had to tweak their beliefs over time.  Why? Well, things happen, both good and bad, from inside and outside the religion.\n\nLet's get this straight, we're gonna be talkin' about \"inside\" and \"outside,\" \"good\" and \"bad,\" ya know, like that.  Inside stuff comes from folks who are already Buddhists, doesn't matter if they're monks or not.  Outside stuff comes from folks who ain't Buddhists.  Anything that hurts Buddhism is bad, like someone tryin' to tear it down.  And anything that doesn't really care, well, that's neutral, good or bad, depends on the outcome.\n\nNow, let's talk about what Buddhists believe. They go for the triple gem: Buddha, the teachings, and the community.  The teachings are all in these books called the Tripitaka:  The Sutta Pitaka has Buddha's talks, the Vinaya Pitaka has the rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka has the deep stuff about how things work. They talk about no soul (Anatta), life is suffering (Dukkha), and everything changes (Anicca).  Gotta understand these things to get outta the cycle of death and rebirth (Sansara).  And when you get outta that cycle, you get rid of desire (lobha), hate (dosa), and delusion (moha), and become enlightened.  The Vinaya Pitaka tells you how to live. Lay folks have five rules, like don't kill, don't lie, don't steal, and so on. Monks have a whole bunch more rules to follow.\n\nThe big idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. First, life is suffering (Dukkha). Second, suffering comes from wanting things (attachment). Third, suffering can stop. Fourth, there's a way to stop suffering.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya, the US and Mexico, they used to be at each other's throats somethin' fierce! Went on for a good 57 years, from way back in 1836 to 1893.  You know, kinda like those feuds ya hear about down south, but on a bigger scale. The biggest fight was back in 1846, the Mexican-American War.  We jumped on Mexico and took their land, Texas and the Southwest, somethin' fierce!  They had a few other run-ins along the way, but finally calmed down just before the First World War.\n\nSee, it all started because these two countries had some real differences,  like religion, culture, how things were done - you know, the usual stuff. And they both wanted the same stuff, makin' things even hotter. Kinda like how neighbors sometimes fight over the fence line.\n\nIt ain't just the US and Mexico either. Lots of countries that share a border end up buttin' heads.  They're close, which means they're always gettin' in each other's way.  Heck, some folks say the US has more problems with Mexico and Cuba than any other country in Latin America.\n\nReligion was a big part of it too.  Back then, Americans weren't too fond of Catholics and Kings, just like they weren't too keen on Communism and Fascism later on. It was all about what ya believed and who was runnin' things. Just like how the US and Russia were at odds during the Cold War, but instead of politics, it was religion that was the main problem.  And it all went back to those old days when the English and Spanish were always fightin'.\n\nThey had a whole bunch of arguments over the years, somethin' like 17!  Most of them were about land, with people crossin' the border and causin' trouble.  Fence-mendin' time, ya know?  \n\nBut eventually, Mexico started dependin' on the US for a lot of stuff, and that kinda cooled things down.  By the late 1800s, the US was more interested in business than in taking more land, so they finally settled down.",
            "Fifteen years ago, things went south for me. I got sick.   A real nasty one, out of nowhere.  See, I was a nurse, always dreamt of being a scientist or a writer, but everyone told me to be a nurse, said it was safe, always in demand.  So, here I was, 46, single, broke, and couldn't work.  Been on disability ever since,  15 years now.  Can't say I own much of anything.  Every day's a struggle, gotta fight for my security, for my sanity.  Nothing's certain anymore, but one thing's for sure: I couldn't have made it this far without my family and a few good friends.  When life throws you a curveball, you realize just how strong you are, or ain't.\n\n\nMy point is, life throws curveballs, big and small.  You can plan for some, but some things are just too big to handle alone.  Now, I get folks talkin' about smaller government, and Lord knows, it ain't exactly runnin' smooth these days. But instead of everyone building their own bunkers, I say we start trustin' each other again.  Helpin' out, ask for help when you need it.\n\nThey say America was built on rugged individualism, but that ain't the whole story.  Our forefathers got through tough times 'cause they looked out for each other, shared what they had, cared for one another.  Those pioneers crossin' the Rockies, they didn't make it alone, did they?\n\nSo, be prepared, I am. Got my disaster kit, first aid stuff, water purification tablets, even plastic sheeting for the windows if we ever get hit with somethin' nasty.  Got flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, and a pantry full of canned goods.  If you got the space, grow your own food, can it, pickle it, whatever.  Wood stove's a good idea too, if you ain't livin' in an apartment.\n\nBut here's the thing:  while you're stockin' up, get to know your neighbors. That's what truly matters.",
            "So, ya know how creatures change over time, right?  Like, why do they become the way they are?  Is there some kinda rulebook for how they gotta evolve? Back in '17, some fella named Thompson said even figuring out the simplest animal in math words was harder than it looked. And today, well, it's still tough!\n\nBut folks are tryin'.  They're usin' math to figure out how seashells, like those spiral kinda ones, grow and change over time.  They're usin' fancy computer programs and pictures of shells to see what shapes they *could* make, and then tryin' to figure out how those shapes actually happened in real life.\n\nThink of a seashell like a little tube windin' around and around. Each loop is called a whorl, and they all go around a center line called the columella.  \n\nThese whorls can get bigger or smaller, and there's a line called a suture between each one.  Usually, the biggest whorl is the last one, and all the rest are called the spire.  The pointy end of the spire is the apex, and the other end, well, that's the base.  And there's a hole called the aperture where the critter lives.\n\nSo, these scientists are tryin' to figure out how all these parts work together to make a shell, and how they change over time. They're usin' math to see what's possible and then tryin' to figure out how those possibilities come true in nature.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya somethin' about these numbers in Indonesia.  \n\nFor the last ten years, babies ain't been doin' so hot.  They ain't dyin' off at a crazy rate, but they ain't gettin' any healthier neither.  Indonesia's doin' okay on some stuff, like gettin' clean water and toilets, but when it comes to moms and babies, they ain't doin' so hot.  They gotta step it up if they wanna meet their goals by 2015.\n\nSee, they're sayin' more babies are bein' born with a doctor or midwife around, which sounds good, right?  Well, not so fast.  A lot of these midwives ain't really trained to handle anythin' serious, so when somethin' goes wrong, well, it ain't good.  That's why so many moms are dyin' from bleedin' out.  \n\nAnd here's another thing: less kids are gettin' help when they're sick, especially with the tummy bugs.  And what about after the baby's born?  Nobody's really keepin' track of that, but it ain't lookin' good.  \n\nThey ain't doin' enough cesarean sections either.  Only 4% of the time.  Now, in the cities, it's 7%, but in the country, it's only 2%.  That tells ya somethin', don't it?  Healthcare ain't reachin' everyone.  It's like the rich folks get all the good stuff and the poor folks are left behind.\n\nSo, what's the answer?  Should they just focus on fixin' one problem at a time, or should they just make the whole healthcare system better?  Well, it's a tough call.  \n\nProgram-specific stuff sounds good, cuz it's easier to see what's workin' and what ain't.  But you know what? Sometimes that means they'll forget about other stuff and everyone'll be tryin' to grab money for their own program.  Plus, it gets confusing with so many different programs doin' the same thing.",
            "Alright, listen up. These fancy Victorian books, they're all about the little details and the rich folks back in the day. But then you got these two, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" they're different kinda beasts. They're like, \"Let's throw in some mystery and some crazy stuff,\" ya know?  It ain't your typical Victorian novel.  This mystery stuff, it makes the characters come alive, ya see? It shows you what they're really thinkin' and feelin'. \n\nTake this part from \"Oliver Twist,\" for instance:\n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\nThese books use mystery, like dreams or somethin', to show you what's goin' on inside their characters.  Like with Oliver, these weird happenings, they show ya what's botherin' him, what he's really seein' in this messed up world. When they finally revisit the shootin' of Oliver, he relives it in his head, like a bad dream. He's tryin' to find help, but it's like he's stuck, ya know? The passage shows how Oliver's got no control over nothin'. He's in bad shape, seein' things, and these hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit are just makin' it worse.  The shootin' just overwhelms him. He can't even feel the pain, it's constant. It's all just fear now. You gotta wonder who's really behind all this bad luck, 'cause it ain't Oliver. This shootin' shows how powerless Oliver really is. He can't even try to stop it, not even when his life is on the line. It's like Old Fagin's broken him, made him give up, ya know?\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.\"",
            "A couple years back, I was workin' at this after-school program, helpin' out those little rugrats with their schoolwork. I was pretty good at English and readin', so I mostly helped out with those. This one kid, Adrian, maybe third or fourth grade, was givin' me fits.  Seemed like he couldn't read worth a lick. He'd nail some words, then totally botch others, real strange. Now, I knew he was Latino, and he spoke perfect English, so it was confusing as heck. \n\nWe were strugglin' to get anywhere when his momma came in one day. Now, she didn't speak a lick of English, only Spanish.  Me, I was just learnin' a few words myself, but we managed to communicate somehow. And then it hit me, like a ton of bricks! Adrian could read fine, he just didn't know the English alphabet that well.  \n\nI don't know if that helped him much, but I hope he's doin' better now. \n\nThat's why I'm talkin' about this language barrier in schools, especially here in California. It ain't always as obvious as ya think. Even if a kid speaks English, readin' it can still be a real struggle. \n\nWe all know this problem exists, so what do we do about it? For Adrian, it was simple:  help him with the English alphabet and pronunciation. But for kids who barely speak English, it's way more complicated. Ain't no one-size-fits-all answer.  Dual language programs,  immersion, private tutors, ESL classes, none of it works solo. We gotta combine 'em all!\n\nFirst off, dual language programs are a good idea, not just for Spanish speakers, but for everyone. You know, kids in those programs do better in school. Some folks are scared, thinkin' it's a waste of money, but that ain't true. \n\nIf we made these programs the norm instead of the exception, everyone would benefit. But how do we do it? We can't make every teacher bilingual, that's crazy talk. But we can have bilingual aides, tutors, whatever ya wanna call 'em, to help out.",
            "Listen, you ever think about why we're all here? I mean, what's the big picture?  Some folks, they go to church or temple, or just try to figure it out on their own.  A lot of us just go along with what our folks taught us, but some, well, they say \"Nah, ain't nothin' out there but what we can see.\" They live for themselves, just their own world, ya know?  And sometimes folks change their minds about all that, what they believe.  No matter what, we're all searchin', tryin' to make sense of it all. We're lookin' for somethin' to guide us, somethin' bigger than ourselves.\n\nMy old man, he always liked cardinals. We were sittin' on the porch, rain hammerin' down, smokin' cigarettes. The gutters were overflowin', and the plants were gettin' soaked. He was lookin' out at the rain, like he was thinkin' about somethin' far away. He'd gotten thinner, his clothes baggy, and his hair was gettin' sparse. He didn't look at me much, just kept starin' at that rain. I felt lost, scared, but I couldn't bring myself to talk about missin' him. It would just make it too real.  So I hugged him, sat back down, and just watched the rain with him.\n\nHe kicked the bucket that December, just five days after I turned 22. The chemo and radiation kept him alive longer than the doctors thought, but it didn't stop the pain. I couldn't figure out what good it did.  If there's a God out there, I thought, he ain't listenin' to me anymore.\n\nI didn't wanna watch him die. I just couldn't. I wanted to remember him how he was, not how he went. Besides, I knew him better than anyone else. I knew he wouldn't want me there watchin' him fade away. So I hid in my bed for three days, waitin' for the news.\n\nNobody even called.",
            "Alright, so this \"Gothic Novel\" thing, it's a real head-scratcher, kinda like when you try to figure out what your Uncle Bubba's talkin' about. This Ian Watt fella, he calls it an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" which means it's both old and new at the same time.  People have been trashin' it, praisin' it, sayin' it's got no depth, then turnin' around and sayin' it's got this \"terrible sublime\" thing goin' on.  That's what Burke said, anyway.  See, this first \"Gothic Novel,\" \"The Castle of Otranto\" by Horace Walpole, it took bits and pieces from those ol' romances and those newfangled novels and mixed 'em together. He called it a \"Gothic Story.\" Kinda like how I like to mix up a good ol' fashioned whiskey with a splash of somethin' sweet.\n\nWalpole, he used all this stuff from old theater and tried to make it fit with the new way of writin' novels. He wanted people to get inside the characters' heads, you know? That's what makes Gothic novels stick around so long, even though they're old as dirt. It's like wearin' your grandpa's boots - they're old, but they still work!\n\nOne of the big things in Gothic novels is this \"Chivalry\" thing. Back in the day, they had these knights, all brave and honorable, and that's what folks were tryin' to be like. But these writers, like Walpole, they thought folks weren't so chivalrous anymore. So they wrote about these knights to make folks remember what they'd lost.\n\nWalpole, he was worried about the world back then, there was a lot of trouble goin' on. Maybe he thought folks had forgotten how to be good, you know? He put that idea into his stories, especially in this character, Frederic. This Frederic fella, he was like a knight outta a fairytale: he was a prince, he'd been through some bad stuff, and everyone thought he was dead.  He's like the poster boy for chivalry, but maybe a little too perfect, kinda like that guy at the gym who's always showin' off.",
            "Alright, so let me tell ya 'bout this thing called supply chain management.  It's like, how ya get stuff from when someone wants it, all the way back to where it started, you know?  This fella, Keith Oliver, came up with the name back in '82. He figured out it's all 'bout makin' sure you get what folks want, fast and cheap.  \n\nNow, there's six big parts to this whole shebang: makin' the stuff, gettin' the stuff, keepin' track of the stuff, knowin' where the stuff is, movin' the stuff, and talkin' 'bout the stuff.  Basically, you gotta do all these things right to keep your customers happy.\n\nFirst off, ya gotta make the stuff. That's the heart of it all.  Gotta figure out what folks want, when they want it, how much they want, and where to make it.  You gotta watch the market, see what people are buyin', and then decide what to build.  Like, if everyone's buyin' red pickup trucks, ya better be makin' red pickup trucks!  \n\nThen ya gotta figure out where to build 'em.  You gotta think about the best place to make the stuff,  keepin' in mind how much it costs and how good it has to be.  After that, ya gotta make a plan for makin' the stuff, makin' sure the machines are workin' right and the workers know what they're doin'.\n\nNext up is gettin' all the parts you need.  You might have different places makin' different parts, like one place for the engines and another for the seats.  Ya gotta make sure all those parts get to the right place at the right time.  Sometimes, ya might even outsource some stuff to other companies.  That's just a fancy way of sayin' ya hire someone else to make somethin' for ya.  It's like when ya take ya car to the mechanic, ya ain't makin' the car yourself, ya just gettin' someone else to do it.",

They got this mean ol' bunch runnin' things, like a bunch of bullies takin' over the schoolyard.  Back in 2007, some monks, they put on their saffron robes, like a fancy uniform, and started marchin' 'cause they weren't happy.   The government, well, they didn't take too kindly to it.  Got real nasty, started beatin' folks up, even killed some journalists, just plain wrong. \n\nNow, this ain't nothin' new, folks.  Governments tryin' to keep folks in line, stomp on anyone speakin' out, that's been goin' on since the cavemen, I reckon.  The Romans, they thought they were gods, runnin' everything. And them Japanese emperors, they thought they were gods too!  Heck, even our own President, George W. Bush, he talks to some fella named Ted Haggard, who runs a group called Stupid People Worldwide.\n\nYou remember that time in China, back in '89?  They had these folks protestin', students and teachers and all, 'cause they didn't like how the government was runnin' things.  Well, the government got real mad, started shootin' folks.  Nobody knows exactly how many died, but it was a whole lot.  Then there was that Rwandan thing, back in the 90s, where they went after all the Tutsis.  And don't forget about Hitler and his bunch, they rounded up all the Jews and...well, you know.",
            "Duke Ellington, he was a real piano man, and he knew how to make his band sound good. He wasn't always the flashiest player, but he sure knew how to write tunes that showed off his guys. Ellington, he'd set up these frameworks where a musician could really let loose and improvise, and he'd also write these tight, orchestrated parts that made each guy in the band sound their best. It was like he knew exactly what made each guy tick, ya know?  He built this sound, this whole vibe, that was all his own.  People say his stuff was some of the most original and brilliant jazz ever made.\nThis dictionary, the Grove Music one, they say Ellington was always usin' the voice as an instrument. This song, \"Creole Love Call\", it shows what he meant. He used the voice to add this texture and color, without all the fuss of words. And it showed how he could make his soloists shine.  This slow blues song, it's got these six different parts, each one different and special.\n\n\nThe first part, it's like a conversation between the voice and the woodwinds, starts smooth, then gets rougher.  The second part, a trumpet solo, playin' muted,  stretchin' out the melody and addin' these bluesy notes.   The third part, the clarinet takes over, playin' high and sweet, with the piano doin' this subtle, syncopated thing in the background.  The fourth part, the whole band chimes in, like a call and response between the brass and the woodwinds.  The fifth part, that's the big one, the woodwinds callin' and respondin' high and bright, with the brass and rhythm section doin' this stop-time thing, like a heartbeat. Then the last part, it goes back to the first part, the voice and the woodwinds talkin' again, but this time the voice gets all raspy, like it's singin' on its own.  Then there's a little tag at the end, a vocal run and a trombone playin' somethin' kinda dissonant, just for fun.\n\nEllington usin' the voice like that, it's like he was colorin' the whole song.  And this was just one of the things he did. In another song, \"Hot and Bothered\", he takes this muted trumpet player, \"Bubber\" Miley, and this scat singer, Baby Cox, and he makes 'em sound like they're talkin' to each other. It's like the trumpet is singin' and the voice is playin' an instrument.  He did the same thing in \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\", usin' this trombone player, Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, to start the melody in a way that was just perfect.",
            "She always felt like somethin' was missin', you know? Like there was a hole in her life that nothin' could fill. It started when she was about 14, just gettin' into that teenage thing, and it was still there three years later, when she was 17. By then, she figured out she wanted someone, not some shiny new thing. But she just wasn't feelin' it for any boys. Some fellas tried to woo her, all awkward and shy, but nothin' ever clicked. She'd wrack her brain, tryin' to figure out why she felt this way, a plain ol' teenage girl with no interest in fellas.  She had a few theories, but nothin' stuck. So she just kept livin', always wonderin' about this feelin' inside her. \n\nNow, her folks were good people, calm and quiet. They never fought, and she hardly ever got in trouble with 'em. The only time they butted heads was when she tried to act like she was all grown up. She was a sweet kid, but she had a big, boisterous personality that stood out against her parents' laid-back vibes. It made her likeable, though. Everyone liked her.\n\nThis day, though, wasn't one of those calm days. She was moseyin' around the house, lookin' for somethin' to get her goin', when she heard a yelp from the kitchen. It was her mama, and she sounded hurt. She ran in, panickin', \"Mom! What's wrong?!\" Her mama was sprawled on the floor, grimachin' and sayin' \"Ow\" between breaths.  She rushed over and put her hand on her mama, tryin' to help. \"Ouch... sweety, I... need you to take me to... the hospital.\"\n\nHer words were choked out, and her daughter knew it was bad. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to meet you.\" Her mama pointed, and her daughter, glad she'd taken those self-defense classes, scooped her mama up and carried her to the car. She laid her down in the back seat and drove like a bat outta hell.\n\nThe hospital smelled like sickness and fear, but she didn't notice. She was too busy lookin' after her mama. She rushed her in, yellin' for help. A bunch of doctors gathered around, and someone wheeled her mama to a bed. They took her away, and her daughter sat there, worry gnawin' at her gut.\n\n\nTurns out, her mama had fallen off a step stool reachin' for somethin' up high.",
            "So, listen up!  This here study wanted to see if eatin' like folks in the Mediterranean, we're talkin' the \"aMed diet,\" would keep ya heart healthy and keep ya from havin' a stroke.  Now, this \"aMed diet\" is like a fancy way of sayin' eat yer fruits, veggies, nuts, and fish, and cut back on the meat and greasy stuff. A little wine's okay too, just don't go overboard. \n\nSee, they done some studies before, and they found that folks who ate like this were less likely to die from heart problems.  They even did a test where they told folks to eat this way, and they lost weight and their cholesterol got better.  But nobody really looked at strokes before.\n\nSo, they got 74,886 women, good lookin' nurses mostly, ages 38 to 63, and asked 'em what they ate for 20 years. They gave these ladies these fancy questionaires,  like \"How much broccoli ya eatin'?\"  They even checked their records to make sure they were tellin' the truth.  They also looked at how much they smoked, if they took vitamins, and if they were usin' hormone stuff after menopause.  \n\nThey figured out that the women who ate more like folks in the Mediterranean were less likely to have a heart attack or a stroke.  Out of all the ladies, 2391 had a heart attack, 1763 had a stroke, and 1077 died from heart problems. The ladies who ate the best were 29% less likely to have a heart attack or stroke.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya, back in '07, this whole country went belly up. Jobs were scarcer than hen's teeth, houses were worth nothin', and even big ol' companies went bust. And guess what? This mess ain't over yet! We gotta figure out what went wrong and how to stop this whole dang train wreck.\n\nSee, it all started with these slick politicians makin' decisions that were about as smart as a possum in a rainstorm. They pressured banks and businesses to give out loans to folks who couldn't afford 'em. It was like pourin' gasoline on a fire, and the whole thing went up in smoke!\n\nNow, there's these fancy organizations called Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. They were supposed to help folks buy homes, but they were gettin' pressured to buy up all these bad loans, pack 'em up like Christmas presents, and sell 'em off to everyone. When folks stopped payin' their mortgages, the whole house of cards came tumblin' down.\n\nThis whole mess started back in the Clinton days. He was tryin' to get re-elected, so he made it easier for folks to get loans, even if they weren't exactly financially stable. Some folks, like this fella Steven Holmes from the New York Times, saw the writing on the wall and warned about what could happen. But nobody listened.\n\nAnd let me tell ya, these newfangled mortgages were somethin' else. They had all these fancy names like \"adjustable-rate mortgages\" and \"collateralized debt obligations.\"  It was like a big ol' tangled mess, and nobody really understood how it all worked.\n\nAll those fancy financial games left folks with more debt than they could handle. And when the housing bubble burst, it was like a bomb goin' off in the economy. Big banks like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers went kaput, and even Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to change their tune. Fannie and Freddie were in deep trouble too, and the government had to step in and bail 'em out.",
            "Listen up, writers! We all know the golden rule: \"Show, don't tell.\" But sometimes, even the best of us get caught up in the weeds and end up with too much talkin' and not enough action. That's where exposition comes in—the part of the story where you dump a whole bucket of information on the reader. It's like watching someone tell you a story while they monopolize the entire conversation. \n\nThink of it like this:  You're reading a story and the author goes on and on about how the main character met her hubby, got hitched in a big ol' shindig, and then BAM! He gets whacked right in front of her eyes. Now, nobody wants to read two pages of that, with characters talking like robots and not showing any real emotion. \n\nInstead, the author should give us some juicy details about this hubby fella. Let us see how much he loved his wife through his words and actions. Show us how she changed and grew because of him. Get us invested in his story so that when he meets his maker, we feel the pain along with her.  \n\nWe want the story to have some meat on its bones! We want to be drawn in and feel like we're right there in the middle of it all.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya 'bout these newscasts I watched from Columbus, Ohio. First up was NBC 4 this mornin', August 13th, 2011.  They lead with this story 'bout this Shad Hostettler fella in Ashley, Ohio. Stabbed his wife good, they said - didn't say her name though.  He looked like a real piece of work, that's for sure. They only gave it couple minutes, seein' as how it was still fresh.  Didn't give too many details, just that he stabbed her a bunch and they got him.  Seemed like about right, y'know?\n\nNext up was this Travis Buyers kid, 18 years old, shot in Sharon Woods.  Critically hurt, they said, and nobody had a clue who did it. SWAT team was on the case.  This one seemed kinda rushed, though.  Makes you wonder, don't it?  Maybe 'cause it was a black kid?  Cause I've noticed, and I'm talkin' for years now, they don't give minorities the same attention when they're in trouble.  If it's a white kid, missing or hurt, they go nuts. But a black kid? Lucky if they even mention it.\n\nThen they had this story about a bullet hole in a Med-Flight helicopter.  .22 caliber, they said, from a rifle.  They were offering five grand for tips, tryin' to catch the shooter.\n\nNext up was the weather, talkin' 'bout rain and thunderstorms comin' Saturday.  They said it'd be in the low eighties all weekend.   Kinda short on that one, like they were just teasin' ya.\n\nThen they had this story 'bout a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road.  Said the guy was a dark-skinned black fella, wearin' a hoodie.  Six foot tall, about one hundred and fifty pounds.  Seemed like they kept goin' on 'bout the color of his skin, don't ya think?\n\nLast one was 'bout this Rene Rodriguez, some big-shot drug dealer from Texas.  They said he was caught sellin' a whole lotta weed to Ohio.  He got 300 months - that's 25 years, for them keepin' score. They even mentioned he was Hispanic.  Not really sure why they thought that mattered.",
            "Brothers, they're somethin' else, ain't they?  Like nothin' else in the world, ya know?  Love 'em, hate 'em, get mad at 'em, but they're always there.  They see right through ya, like lookin' in a mirror.  Sometimes that's good, sometimes it's real bad.   Like,  brothers understand each other, more than anyone else. They see themselves in each other, good and bad.  When things get rough, that's when ya really see what kinda bond they got.  It can be powerful, strong as hell, but it can also hurt like crazy. \n\nThis book, \"The Scarlet Ibis\", it talks about that bond,  the good and the bad.  Two brothers, settin' out on this crazy journey, and it all goes south.   One brother, he's got this pride thing goin' on, thinks he's better than the other.  It's like he wants this perfect brother, someone to match him, ya know?  But the other brother, he's different.  He can't keep up, can't do all the things the older brother wants to do.  They're both different, they both got somethin' to learn.  The story shows how pride can hurt, how it can lead to bad decisions.  It's a tough read, but it makes ya think, ya know?",
            "Y'all listen up, cuz this brain thing is a real head scratcher, kinda like tryin' to figure out what my brother was talkin' about after a night out dancin'. \n\nSee, back in the day, folks thought the brain was like a wax tablet, ya know, somethin' ya could write on and wipe clean. Then it was like papyrus, like them old scrolls. Then folks got fancy and said it was like a book. Now, these brainy scientists, they say it's like a computer. But lemme tell ya, all these comparisons, they ain't always right.\n\nSo, you gotta understand, this brain of ours, it's like a big ol' factory, takin' in all sorts of stuff. You see somethin', hear somethin', feel somethin', all that gets turned into signals, like little messages. Then, your brain, it's like a master chef, takin' those messages and cookin' up somethin' outta them. It's a two-way street, too. It's like, sometimes your brain uses what it already knows to figure things out faster, kinda like when you see a box and you know right away what it is.\n\nAnd then there's this thing called attention, it's like a bouncer at a club, choosin' what gets in and what gets tossed out. Your brain's got so much goin' on, it can't pay attention to everything. It's like, you see a million blades of grass, but you don't really notice each one. But if someone says your name, bam! You hear it clear as day.\n\nNow, your brain, it's gotta store all this information, like a giant library. There's different kinds of memory, short-term, long-term, all sorts of things. It's like, you hear somethin', you gotta hold onto it for a bit, then maybe tuck it away for later. And how it all gets organized, well, that's a whole other story, like tryin' to figure out the whole damn Dewey Decimal System.",
            "Listen up, folks! This here Huxley fella, he's got somethin' to say about all this fancy newfangled technology and the way the money folks run things. See, in his book, \"Brave New World,\" folks are all about lookin' out for each other, but they ain't thinkin' for themselves none. They're all about havin' a good time right now, no matter what.  \n\nIt's like they're puppets, y'know?  This big boss man, the World Controller, he's pullin' all the strings.  And Huxley, he's sayin' this whole thing is gonna mess us up somethin' fierce.  He's talkin' about how the rich folks are keepin' the poor folks in the dark, makin' them think they're better off than they really are.  He sees right through it, just like I see through a politician's promises.  It's all smoke and mirrors, folks.  \n\nHe calls it \"false consciousness,\" like they're dreamin' a dream they think is real.  But the truth is, they're gettin' used, used like a cheap tool.  They're buyin' into a system that ain't doin' nothin' but line the pockets of the fat cats.   \n\nAnd these folks, they ain't even thinkin' 'bout it.  They're too busy chasin' after the next shiny thing, the next pleasure.  They don't even know how to feel real emotions anymore, let alone fight back.   \n\nIt's a sad state of affairs, folks.  And Huxley, he's tryin' to wake us up.  He's sayin' we gotta start thinkin' for ourselves, gotta see through the lies.   We gotta fight for our freedom, or we're gonna end up livin' in a world where we're nothin' but cogs in a machine.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya, this here Uni Park's a right pain in the neck to get around, especially if ya live like me, way out East Halls, where the sun don't shine and the wind blows hard enough to blow ya off your feet.  It's a good thing I ain't got to walk all the way to Willard Buildin' - that's like walkin' from here to Dallas!  Used to be, there was nothin' out there but open fields, but now they're buildin' all sorts of fancy stuff - sports fields, new buildings, even apartments.  Makes ya wonder what's next, a dang rodeo?  Point is, this place keeps gettin' bigger, and harder to navigate.  \n\nNow, I reckon the best way to get around this campus is on a dang bicycle.  But a bicycle ain't gonna do ya no good if nobody's ridin' it, and the campus ain't built for bikes.  \n\nI was talkin' to my buddy the other day, and he said he'd been ridin' again after takin' a break for a few years.  He said, \"Man, why'd I ever stop?  Bikes are the only way to get around these parts.\"  He's right, ya know?  Besides bein' good for ya, they're the fastest way to get from Point A to Point B.  I ain't talkin' 'bout no fancy mountain bike, just a regular ol' bike, and a bowl of grits for breakfast will get ya goin' for 30 miles or more.\n\nI live off campus now, just as far from the center of campus as some of those dorms.  Best thing I did this year was buy a bike.  Used to take me a good 25 minutes to walk to my class in Thomas Buildin'.  Now, whiz on over there in 5 minutes flat if I pedal like the wind.  The only problem is, Pollock Road ain't always the friendliest place for a bike.\n\nWalkin' ain't bad, but I ain't got time for it.  Without my bike, I'd be walkin' to class every day, and that's a whole lotta time wasted.  Think about it, over 2 1/2 hours a week just walkin' to class.  Add that to walkin' to other places, and I ain't got no time for nothin' else."
