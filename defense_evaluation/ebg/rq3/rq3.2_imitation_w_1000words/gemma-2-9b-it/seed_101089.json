            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

And I wanna help families that are fallin' apart. I'm talkin' 'bout real help, the kinda that makes a difference.\n\nI believe in treatin' folks right, doin' the right thing, and always tryin' to be better.  It ain't just about social work, it's about livin' right.  See, I always wanted to help folks, but I didn't know how.  Back in school, I saw a lot of folks runnin' from their problems, doin' things that weren't right.  That's why I got my Psychology degree, figured it would help me understand.\n\nOne time, I met this young kid, just sixteen,  scared outta his wits.  His folks were treatin' him awful.  I knew I had to do somethin'. I talked to the cops, told 'em what I knew.  Turns out, the law couldn't do much, so they asked me to talk to the parents.  When I did, they were nervous, tryin' to make excuses for how they treated their own son.\n\nThat's when I knew, I gotta be a social worker. Gotta help these kids, protect 'em from folks who don't know how to treat 'em right.\n\nAnd let me tell ya, fairness matters. We say everyone's important, but we act like we all gotta be the same.  I ain't buyin' it. I'm gonna stand up for what's right, fight for the folks who can't fight for themselves.  I've always done that, standin' up against bullies, racists, anyone tryin' to push folks down.  That's my way, and it ain't gonna change.",
            "Well now, lemme tell ya 'bout this here sleep stuff.  Seems like there's two ways folks look at it: the insides of your head, and what's goin' on around ya. \n\nFirst, ya got the folks who say it's all in your genes, like inheritin' a bad back or a love for chili. They talk 'bout stuff like your brain cells and how they work, like that there orexin thingy.  They did some tests on mice, sayin' that these orexin fellas tell ya when to sleep and when to stay awake.  They found that messin' with these little fellas can make a mouse sleepy or wired.  So, if you got a messed up orexin, maybe that's why you can't sleep right.\n\nThen ya got the folks who say it's all 'bout your life, like your job, your fam, and who you hang with.

They're lookin' at all the studies and tryin' to figure out which one makes more sense. They even talkin' 'bout different kinds of sleep problems, like when you just can't fall asleep or when you fall asleep but can't stay asleep.",
            "Alright, so this here paper's talkin' 'bout somethin' called Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD for short.  It's kinda like this, see?  Some folks, they hear just fine, but their brains, well, their brains ain't quite cuttin' it when it comes to understandin' what they hear.  Like, they can hear you talkin', but they might have trouble makin' sense of it all, or maybe they can't tell where the sounds are comin' from.  We're gonna break it down into three parts: what CAPD is, how ya tell if someone's got it, and what a teacher can do to help out a kid in the classroom that's dealin' with this.   \n\nFirst off, CAPD is like a glitch in the brain's sound center. It ain't that their ears ain't workin', it's that their brain's havin' trouble processin' all the sounds it's gettin'.  They might hear a word, but they can't quite figure out what it means, or they might hear lots of different sounds at once and not be able to tell 'em apart.   People first started talkin' 'bout this kinda thing back in the 50s, but it took a while to figure out what was goin' on.   \n\nNow, there ain't no one test that can tell ya for sure if someone's got CAPD, but there are ways to figure it out.  Doctors and teachers might use tests and watch how a kid listens and responds to sounds, seein' if they're havin' any trouble. It's kinda like when you're watchin' a kid play, you can tell if they're strugglin' with somethin' just by watchin' 'em.\n\nSo, what can a teacher do if they've got a kid in their class with CAPD? Well, that's what we're gonna talk about next.",
            "So, this play, Twelfth Night, it's sayin' somethin' about how usin' disguises, even if it works for a while, can mess ya up real bad.

See, some folks might not care if you tricked 'em, but others, they'll be real mad and think you're a phony.\n\nNow, when it comes to pretendin' to be the opposite gender, that's a whole other can of worms. It makes you wonder, why'd they even do it in the first place? Like, why ditch their own skin and try to be someone else? In Viola's case, it's about stayin' safe. She's in a new place, and she figures if she pretends to be a guy, folks won't mess with her so much. \n\nIt works, but now she's all alone, cut off from the other women. And to make things worse, she's so good at playin' the guy role that Olivia, this rich lady, falls for her! Olivia even calls her \"husband\", can you believe that? And then there's Orsino, the Duke, who's got feelings for Viola, even though she's playin' a dude. It's a whole tangled mess.\n\nBut maybe that's the point. Maybe this play is sayin' that pretendin' can help folks figure out what they really feel.  Olivia and Orsino, maybe they were hidin' some feelings they didn't even know they had. Maybe Olivia's not even really into Cesario, but she's just so used to lookin' at folks and judgin' 'em by their looks, that she falls for the act. Once she sees Sebastian, who's Viola's twin brother, she forgets all about Cesario.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya, them Germans, they weren't exactly known for bein' nice to folks when they were runnin' things. Especially in that place they called South West Africa, now Namibia. They done messed up real bad, killed a whole bunch of Ovaherero and Nama folks. Now, I ain't sayin' all the Germans were bad, mind ya. They ran things different in different places, just like folks do today. \n\nWhen them Brits took over in East Africa after the war, they found a whole lot of Africans could read and write, thanks to the Germans. Seems like they did alright in some places, like Kamerun. But down in South West Africa, it was a whole different story.\n\nThey basically left it up to those missionary folks to teach the natives, and the government didn't give 'em much help. But for the white folks, they built schools and made sure them missionaries were doin' things right.  Makes ya wonder what kinda thinking was goin' on there, huh?\n\nAnyway, long story short, most of the folks in South West Africa couldn't read or write after the Germans left. It was like they never even tried. Now, I'm not sayin' it was all the Germans' fault, but those policies they had sure didn't help.\n\nThere's a whole lotta books written about how the Germans ran things in their colonies, mostly by them Germans themselves back in the day. Then some folks from England started doin' some studies, comparin' how things were done in different places.\n\nOne fella, Cohen, he wrote a book about how things were different in South West Africa and East Africa. He said it all comes down to the fact that South West Africa had a lot more white folks livin' there. \n\nNow, South West Africa wasn't exactly a hotbed of activity, but it wasn't too bad either. There were a whole lot more white folks there than in any of the other German colonies.",
            "Listen up, folks! Music's changed a whole lot in the last hundred years. There's so many dang styles now, it's hard to keep track! You got your rock, your country, your jazz, your rap, and a whole mess of others. And get this, each one of those has a bunch of little sub-genres, like little branches on a tree.\n\nNow, Heavy Metal rock? That's a real wild one. It's been around for about 40 years and it's got all kinds of flavors. It's like a big ol' potluck, everyone bringin' their own dish. Some folks like it dark and moody, others like it loud and fast. You got your death metal, your thrash metal, your power metal, and more than I can even remember. \n\nIt's gotten so crazy that it's hard to say exactly what makes something \"heavy metal\" anymore. It's like a chameleon, changin' colors all the time to fit in with whatever's popular. But even though it's all mixed up now, it all started somewhere.\n\nYou see, Heavy Metal is more than just music. It's a whole movement, like a big ol' family. It's about bein' loud, bein' proud, and bein' different. It's about takin' what you got and makin' it your own.\n\nIt's got this dark side to it, kinda like a storm cloud.  It's got more bass, more guitars, more drums, more everything! The guys in these bands are real musicians, they know their stuff. And let's be honest, a little bit of drugs never hurt nobody, right? \n\nIt's like the Beatles, even they got in on the action with songs like \"Helter Skelter.\"  Talk about dark!",
            "Well, lemme tell ya, this fella Rousseau, he was a dreamer, sorta like those fancy Surrealists, but he was doin' it way back before they came along.  See, he painted this picture, \"The Dream,\" back in 1910, and it ain't just some gal starin' at pretty things in her sleep. It's like he's puttin' his own hopes and dreams on that canvas, ya know?\n\nThis guy, he wanted folks to think he was a real artist, to be respected by the fancy art crowd. But here's the catch: he was stuck between a rock and a hard place. He wanted to be accepted, but he also wanted to paint his own dang way.  \n\nNow, this Rousseau fella, he wasn't born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He worked for the government, collectin' tolls, and never had any fancy art lessons. He lost his wife and kids, too, which left him pretty heartbroken. So, he took up paintin' as a way to make somethin' of himself and find some peace. He wasn't tryin' to be all fancy and highbrow like some of the other artists, he just wanted to paint what he saw and felt.\n\nBut the art world, well, it can be a tough nut to crack.  He was startin' late compared to all the other artists makin' a name for themselves. He wanted to be part of that crowd, to be accepted, but he had to choose: follow the rules or stay true to himself. \"The Dream,\" that's where it all comes together, ya know? It's like a snapshot of his struggle, his desire to be recognized and his fear of losin' his own voice.",
            "A whole bunch of smart folks have said that ethics and beauty are like two sides of the same coin. I reckon they're right. Like that poet Keats said, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\"  We learn most things in life by reading books or doin' things, but we just kinda *know* when somethin's right or wrong, or when somethin's beautiful, without havin' to think too hard about it.  \n\nEthics and beauty ain't about tellin' ya what to do or what to think. It's more about tryin' to figure out *why* somethin' is beautiful or why somethin' is right. Like, when we talk about a painting bein' good, we might talk about the colors and the shapes, but that don't really explain why it makes us feel somethin'. It's like when you're asked about your favorite song, you just gotta say, \"There's just somethin' about it,\" ya know?\n\nSame goes for morals. We can talk about right and wrong all day long, but it's hard to put it into words. It's like Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way.\" There's always somethin' more to it than just the words.  \n\nI think that's what makes art and morals so powerful. They touch somethin' deep inside us that we can't always explain.  It's like when you read a good book, or see somethin' truly beautiful. It just makes ya feel somethin'. And I think that's why they're so connected.",
            "Germany today is a powerful country, united and full of its own unique culture. You can feel this culture everywhere, from Munich in the shadow of the Alps all the way to Kiel by the Baltic Sea. It's the same story from Cologne on the Rhine River, through the heart of Germany, and to Dresden, that cool Saxon city on the Elbe.  It makes sense that Germany, as we know it now, came from all sorts of different places and people.\n\nThe land we know as Germany has been home to Germans for ages. Where the name \"Germany\" came from is something folks still argue about. Some say it comes from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, back when they lived across the Rhine River and fought those Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar, way back when, first used the word \"Germanus\" in his writings about the Gallic Wars. He used it to tell the difference between the Gauls he conquered and those pesky Germanic tribes who kept crossing the Rhine (Caesar, 50-40 BC). Some think he got the word from the Gauls themselves.  Others think it comes from the spear they used in battles, called a \"ger\" (O.E.D, 2010), or maybe from an old Irish word meaning \"to shout,\" because, well, Germans were known for being loud (Names of Germany).\n\nTacitus, a Roman historian, wrote way back in 98 AD about the origins of the Germans. He said they were the original people in Germany, not mixed with anyone else (Tacitus, 98).  He thought it would be crazy for anyone to leave Asia, Africa, or even Italy to come to Germany! Who would want to live in a wild, cold place with grumpy people? (Tacitus, 98).\n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germany? Not the Romans, not at first anyway. They might send out armies to grab stuff from Germany or fight battles, but they mostly just went back home to their big empire.  As the Germanic tribes popped up around the first century, they lived right on the edge of the Roman Empire. They traded goods they took from the land and even fought for the Romans in their army (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "Man, I was lookin' at this thing, just starin' at it.  My mind was workin' but not really gettin' anywhere. I was takin' it all in, you know, like a scientist or somethin', but it wasn't clickin' for me.  Thoughts were poppin' up and disappearin' faster than a fly at a picnic. It was like my brain was on autopilot, just processin' the sights without really thinkin' about 'em. \n\nThis one time, this art fella I knew told me about this book, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\"  I always wanted to learn how to draw, ever since I was a kid, and this book promised to teach ya everything, even how your brain makes sense of lines.  One trick it had was to put a square around whatever you're lookin' at, like a frame.  So, instead of lookin' at this whole mess, you're just focusin' on that one part, like a bowl of fruit on a table.  \n\nBut lookin' at this thing, I couldn't picture that frame. I was just overwhelmed, man.  Like, Picasso had his blue period, Monet loved green, and all those fancy Italian guys painted with every color under the sun. I was tryin' to think, \"Maybe this is my thing, my art, my story.\" But all I could think was, \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nSo there I was, holdin' this thing, my hand ready to go.  My muscles were tensed up, like I was about to do somethin' important. And then I did it.  Water swirlin', clean and clear, stuff fallin' away.  My hand went for the toilet handle again, this time with more force. I swear, that brown thing was stuck like glue.  \n\nMop in one hand, lookin' like a fool in my green tie, I stared at this mess someone left behind.  A few more flushes, a few more moments of quiet contemplation, and then I reached for the toilet paper.  I wrapped it around my hand like I was mummifyin' somethin'.  \n\nI stood up straight, then bent over, my hand reaching into the bowl, like I was checkin' on a turkey in the oven...",
            "Listen, folks, these young whippersnappers are dyin' behind the wheel! It ain't just some fluke, there's a whole bunch of stuff goin' on, ya know?  The big brains at the National Institutes of Health say those teen brains ain't even ready for the danger of drivin', just plain greenhorns, that's all.  And that lack of experience, well, it's a recipe for disaster. More crashes, more rollovers, even more speedin' and drivin' off the road, ya hear?\n\nNow, ain't nothin' worse than those teenagers cruisin' around with their buddies, and we all know they do it all the time.  Some fancy-pants group in California did a study, showed it plain as day – the more buddies in the car, the more trouble they get into.\n\nSo California and some other states, they're tryin' to help out, givin' these young'uns temporary licenses, limitin' their hours and who they can have in the car.  But that's like puttin' a bandage on a bullet wound, ya know?\n\nThe real problem is, these kids just ain't ready to handle the car, plain and simple. Some smart fella, Marvin Zuckerman, he says 18 ain't even old enough! He's done some studies, shows that young folks just love to take risks, get that thrill, ya get me?  So maybe we should wait a bit longer, let 'em grow up some, before they're behind the wheel.\n\nWe keep lettin' 'em drive, it's gonna be a bloodbath out there! All those baby boomers' kids, they'll be drivin' soon, and it'll be chaos!  We need new laws, somethin' to keep these kids safe. Schools can teach 'em about drivin', but no one under 18 gets behind the wheel, plain and simple.  Then maybe a temporary permit, and some practice with a grown-up.\n\nLook, it ain't rocket science, folks! We gotta do somethin' before more kids end up in the graveyard. National laws, that's what it takes.  We can save lives, I tell ya!",
            "So I was lookin' through these old Edison movies, see, the ones from way back when, and I found a bunch of these trick films.  There were fifteen of 'em, made between 1895 and 1901.  These movies, they ain't your regular stuff, they use some fancy editing tricks to make ya think things are happenin' that ain't.\n\nI spent a good amount of time lookin' at these flicks, tryin' to figure out how they worked their magic.  Most of 'em, they stick to the same old ways, ya know? They're shot in one spot, like they're on a stage, and the camera just sits there, no movin' around.  They use long shots and medium shots, never gettin' close up on nothin'.  And each movie, well, it's like one big idea, one shot, boom, it's over.\n\nBut then there's a few of these later ones, they start doin' somethin' different, like usin' more than one shot in a movie. It's like they're tryin' something new.\n\nOne thing that's real common in these trick films is that they're all shot inside, like they're on a stage.  The camera just sits there, watchin' the action go on, never movin'. Kinda like how they used to do it in vaudeville shows.  So the folks in the movies, they just walk back and forth, never comin' closer or goin' further away from the camera.\n\nAnd because they're all shot in one spot, they use long shots and sometimes medium shots, but never nothin' close up. That's 'cause they wanted folks to see the whole thing, just like at a play.\n\nAnd these movies, they're real short, just a minute or less, 'cause each one is like one big idea. They're mostly just a bunch of little tricks, like makin' somethin' disappear or reappear, kinda like magic.\n\nNow, here's the thing, sometimes what looks like one shot in the movie, it might actually be a bunch of shots put together to make the trick work.  Take this one movie, \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots,\" for instance. It looks like it's all one shot, but if you look real close, you can see where they cut between shots to make it look like her head's been cut off.",
            "This John Taylor fella, he was all about bein' a good ol' Republican, ya know?  He was a farmer, through and through, but even him talkin' politics, he was a straight shooter, always speakin' his mind about freedom and how the government should run. See, he thought farm life was the best, and that's what shaped his whole view on everything. He wanted to keep things simple, protect the farmers, and that's what drove his ideas about the government, the Constitution, even the courts.\n\nJohn believed America had a real shot at buildin' somethin' special, somethin' better than what Europe had.  Since we didn't have all that old-world baggage, we could start fresh, build a system where folks could govern themselves. He was all about folks havin' rights, natural rights, that's what he called 'em, and he said if one right gets messed with, they all start fallin' apart. Government shouldn't be messin' with those rights none. He said back in the \"wild west,\" the strong guys always took what they wanted, but in a civilized society, that ain't right.\n\nTo make this perfect society, John thought we needed a government that understood both the good and bad in people. He was a firm believer in good and evil, that folks are born with 'em both. He said, \"Government's run by people, so it's gonna have all the good and bad that people have.\"  He thought good government protected your stuff, helped farmers, and kept people from gettin' too greedy.  He believed even if a government was run by scoundrels, it'd still work if it was built on those good principles.\n\nHe thought folks are naturally selfish, but that's not always bad. It's only bad when folks get greedy and try to take advantage of others.  A good government keeps folks in line, but we gotta watch it close so it don't start doin' bad things itself.\n\nJohn, like a lot of his Republican friends, wanted a government that stuck to the Constitution. He wanted it small and simple, just doin' what the Constitution said, nothin' more. He knew a big government cost a lot of money and could easily turn into a tyrant. But he said just readin' the words ain't enough, gotta understand what the fellas who wrote it meant. He thought the Declaration of Independence was more important, 'cause it said America was a bunch of states, each lookin' out for themselves, not one big country.",
            "Alright, so listen up, we had this project, see, and it was about gettin' folks to ditch their cars and  walk or bike to work.  Figure 17, that there chart, shows things went south around the third month. Kinda bummed us out, to be honest.  \n\nNow, it's New England, so winter hit hard, right?  Folks ain't walkin' or bikin' much when it's snowin' or freezin'. December, that's when the semester ends, everyone's swamped with schoolwork and whatnot.  Fillin' out a log for the project?  Yeah, that probably slipped their minds.  Then December's when the holidays hit, and everyone's scatterin' for the hills.  Students and teachers gone, ain't nobody on campus for a whole month.  Come January, things start up again, but by then, the log entries are still low.  \n\nNow, I reckon any project starts with a bang, folks all excited, then it fades a little.   To try and keep things goin', we had this \"Carpool Challenge Week\" in March, like a big ol' push to get folks back on track.  Worked, too, entries went up.  But heck, keepin' things movin' when folks are busy or on break? That's a challenge right there.\n\nAnother thing is, folks love their cars.  It's part of our culture.  Gotta give 'em somethin' to make 'em wanna ditch the wheels.  We gave out gift cards, you know, to restaurants, coffee shops, even massage places.  But I wonder if somethin' bigger woulda worked, like a shiny new bike, a hybrid car, or maybe even a fancy electric one.  \n\nThe prizes stayed the same the whole time.  Maybe if we'd upped the ante, like sayin', \"Hey, in December, we're givin' away bikes!\" and then, in January, \"And in January, it's a hybrid car!\"  Maybe that'd have kept folks interested.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya 'bout these fancy things called ETFs, they're like index funds but fancier, kinda like a stock but traded on the market. You know how index funds track somethin' like the whole market, but ETFs are more like pickin' a few stocks to follow.  And here's the deal, they're cheaper than those mutual funds, but ya gotta pay a little somethin' somethin' each time ya buy or sell 'em, just like regular stocks.  The good thing about ETFs is there's a whole bunch of 'em out there, so ya can find one for just about anything.  Now, some folks say ETFs give ya all the good stuff of a fund, like spreadin' your money around, but ya gotta look close and make sure they ain't just talkin' a big game.  \n\nNow lemme tell ya 'bout this one ETF, IHF, I'm gonna compare it to the top ten stocks it's made up of. I'm gonna see if just buyin' those ten stocks straight up is better than buyin' the whole ETF.  \n\nSee, these ten stocks make up most of what's in the ETF, like 63% or somethin'.  So we're gonna see if they act like the whole ETF, like if they make the same kinda money or have the same kinda risk.  I'm gonna figure out somethin' called \"Beta,\" which tells ya how risky somethin' is, and \"return,\" which is how much money ya make.\n\nWell, turns out, the ten stocks made a little more money than the whole ETF, like 6% more. And they were a little less risky too.  So it looks like buyin' those ten stocks straight up might be a better deal. But I gotta make sure it ain't just luck, ya know?\n\nSo I'm gonna check somethin' called \"standard deviation,\" which tells ya how much the price of somethin' goes up and down. If the ten stocks are less risky than the ETF, then maybe buyin' just those ten stocks is the way to go.",
            "Alright, so Poe, he thought \"Dream-Land\" was one of his best poems, ya know? Now, in this poem, he uses this word \"Thulé\", like a fancy name for a place.  Turns out, some smart guy named Mabbott figured out that Poe got this word from an old fella named Virgil. Virgil wrote about this island called Thulé way up north, past Britain, where folks back then thought the world ended.  Now, Virgil definitely used the word, but there's this other guy, Goethe, who Poe really liked.  Poe was a big fan of German writers. \n\nThis whole thing about Thulé is important 'cause it shows Poe knew his stuff, ya know? This guy, Arndt, wrote a book comparing Poe's poem to Goethe's, and he thinks Poe was basically copying him.  \n\nGoethe was a big deal back then. This book of his called \"Faust\" was super famous, with two parts, one in 1808 and the other when he died, 1832.  There's this little poem in the second part of \"Faust\" called \"The King of Thulé.\" It's about this king who loses his wife, and after she dies, he just drinks and cries all the time.  He's so sad he decides to die too, and he gives away everything except this fancy goblet his wife gave him. He goes to a cliff, throws the goblet in the ocean, closes his eyes, and that's it.\n\nNow, the King of Thulé, he's kinda like Poe's character in \"Dream-Land,\" maybe a dark reflection of Poe's own sadness and drinking problems.  \"Faust\" was even made into a play in 1842, just before Poe used the word \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"  \n\nPoe only uses \"Thulé\" a couple of times in his writing. Once in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and twice in \"Dream-Land\" at the beginning and end of the poem.  You could almost read them together, like they're friends. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker talks about this dark, lonely place called Thulé, haunted by dead friends, and everything's just gray and sad.  It's like he's stepped right into the King of Thulé's story.\n\nGoethe was a big shot, and Poe would've known him, even if it was just 'cause Poe liked Tennyson. Plus, everyone was copying Goethe back then.",
            "So, some lady named Jennifer Palmer went and slipped on some applesauce in a grocery store, hurt her back real bad.  Now she's trying to sue the store, sayin' the manager knew about the spill and didn't clean it up for half an hour 'cause he was busy eatin' dinner. She wants the store to pay her extra money, kinda like a punishment, 'cause she says the manager was bein' a real jerk. \n\nSee, in California, ya gotta prove the store manager did somethin' real bad on purpose, like he meant to hurt her or was just plain nasty.  The lady's sayin' he knew folks were slipin' and fallin' on spills all the time, but still didn't care. That's a pretty good argument, maybe even mean enough to get her extra money.\n\nIt all happened back in 2009.  Two employees told the manager, Paul, about the spilled applesauce. He just told 'em to go away 'cause he was eatin'.  Then, half an hour later, Jennifer goes and slips, hurts herself somethin' fierce.\n\nThe lady's lawyer is sayin' this ain't just a simple accident, it's like the manager was willfully ignorin' the danger, like he didn't care if someone got hurt. That's what they mean by \"despicable\" I guess.\n\nSo now the judge's gotta decide if the manager was really that bad, bad enough to pay extra money.  That's a tough one, huh?",
            "Y'all know, back when I took that Islam class at CBC, like four years ago, we talked a lot about whether Islam was a mean religion or not. Seems even more important now, don't ya think? After 9/11, the media went from really hating on Muslims and folks like that to bein' all soft on 'em. Like, could you imagine back in 2001 havin' a president named Barack Obama, with his Muslim family history? No way!\n\nNow, this book about Muhammad, it's got me confused. See, I always thought he was a real tough guy, conquerin' tribes and makin' 'em turn Muslim. But this book paints him as a martyr, misunderstood and humble. People just came to him, seein' the truth in his words.  It's like they're tryin' to make him out to be some kinda saint.\n\nAnd get this - there are some things about Muhammad's story that sound a lot like stuff Jesus did. Like, he turned milk and meat into enough for forty guys! It makes me wonder if they're tryin' to steal Jesus' thunder, y'know? They're downplayin' Jesus' miracles to make Muhammad look bigger.\n\nThe book also tells a lot of stories about folks convertin' to Islam on their own, but it's all hearsay. They say \"So-and-so told me, who heard it from so-and-so.\" Makes it sound fishy to me.\n\nWhat really bothers me is how they try to make Muhammad seem so perfect, humble, and wise. But history ain't got nothin' on that, no sir. I just can't believe Muslims today know the whole story about how Muhammad got so powerful.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya, it seems like them fancy theologians done went and changed up Jesus's teachings somethin' fierce since he kicked the bucket. Kinda like how my buddy took my pool plans and made 'em his own, but didn't ask first.\n\nLook, the world's gettin' more open-minded every day, like a rusty gate finally swingin' open. Now, some folks are stuck in their ways, like a mule in a ditch, but they ain't gonna change the whole darn world. More and more folks are gonna start lookin' back and seein' what got added to Christianity over the years, stuff that wasn't even in Jesus's playbook.\n\nIt might take a while, maybe decades or even longer, but mark my words, things are gonna change. It'll be like rewindin' a VCR, goin' back to the basics, back to Jesus's original message. Imagine folks gettin' rid of all that extra stuff, layer by layer, until all that's left is Jesus himself, plain and simple.\n\nThis change is gonna sweep through America and Europe faster than a wildfire, and folks are gonna start worshipin' like it's the good ol' days back when Jesus walked the earth. The church, well, they'll be leadin' the way, but things are gonna be different.\n\nAll these different churches, all these different ideas, it's gonna start to fade away. It'll be more like one big family again, everybody singin' from the same hymn book.\n\nHistory's full of these big changes, like when the Romans went from persecutin' Christians to becomein' Christians themselves. Or how America went from slavery to havin' Black folks leadin' the way.\n\nThis time, it's gonna be about Christianity, goin' back to its roots, gettin' rid of all the fancy stuff, and comin' together as one.\n\nAnd here's the secret sauce: folks are gonna start seein' Jesus's words differently, not just as plain words, but like stories and symbols.\n\nNow, let's talk about where it all started.\n\nWay back in the day, before Jesus came along, there was Judaism. It was all about one God, God's word, and the Hebrew scriptures.\n\nThe Jewish folks weren't all on the same page, though. They had their own groups, like the Sadducees, the Pharisees, the Essenes, and the Zealots.",
            "Listen,  this book, \"The Jungle\", it shows us how folks, deep down, they're just plain greedy.  It's all about lookin' out for number one, ya know? They don't give a hoot about anyone else, especially if they're not makin' them rich.  \n\nYou see it right there in the bosses of these big factories. They just wanna make their companies bigger and bigger, no matter who gets hurt along the way.  They don't care about the smoke pourin' outta their chimneys, or the stinkin' mess from all the animals around the place.  It's all about the money, see?  Like that author, Sinclair, he says, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". That's how bad it was, man. \n\nAnd the bosses, they don't care about their workers neither. They'll work 'em 'til they drop, then fire 'em without a second thought.  Back then, there weren't no rules protectin' folks, so the bosses could do whatever they wanted. It was a real dog-eat-dog world in that Packingtown. \n\nThe workers were treated worse'n dogs, like slaves.  They were workin' themselves to death, but nobody helped 'em. Even the unions were just lookin' out for themselves. They were makin' money off the backs of the poor folks. \n\nIt's a real sad story, man. Just shows how greed can corrupt people, and how the powerful can take advantage of the weak.",
            "Some writers, they got tricks for makin' ya feel somethin' 'bout what they're writin', ya know? Some ways work better'n others. F. Scott Fitzgerald, he's one smart fella, he uses all kinds of tricks in his book, \"The Great Gatsby\". Sometimes he'll put words together that don't usually go together, like a \"blue banana\", just to make ya feel somethin' different about somethin'. Other times, he'll pick a color or somethin', give it a meaning, and then use that same color to make ya feel that same way 'bout somethin' important. He does that with colors all the time, like gold, green, white, gray, and even red and pink. \n\nIn \"The Great Gatsby\", he builds up meanings for these colors, especially white and gray, and then uses 'em to make ya remember somethin' 'bout somethin' important. He uses white and gray to mean, well, kinda like boring sameness, like everything's the same. White's a bit fancier, and gray's more like old and worn out. He starts doin' this right at the beginning of the book. Daisy and Jordan are always wearin' white, like all the time! Nick wears white pants to Gatsby's party, Tom's wearin' a white shirt when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine's all pale and white.  The only time folks ain't wearin' white is when Nick's gettin' a feel for Gatsby's party, and then it's all bright colors, like nothin' like white. He uses these colors to describe all sorts of things, too, like Nick goin' to work down these white streets, or  names at Gatsby's party lookin' gray on Nick's list. Catherine's apartment, it's like a big white cake, all the same. He even uses white and gray for folks and places that ain't nothin' special, like Jordan and Daisy's childhood, the cars and the land in the valley of ashes, even a little kid and an old dog seller.\n\nAfter he's used white and gray enough, he starts usin' 'em to show that somethin' ain't important or that it's just the same as everything else. He does this with Daisy first. After he don't use white or gray for a while, he starts describin' Daisy wearin' white in a white car. Now, we start seein' Daisy as less of a real person and more like somethin' Gatsby just wants, somethin' plain and boring. He keeps doin' this with Daisy, like describin' her fur collar as a gray haze. It's all about makin' ya feel somethin' about Daisy, somethin' kinda flat and empty.",
            "San Diego's weather is perfect for growin' crops, y'all.  They got tomatoes, citrus, greens, squash, broccoli, all sorts of herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, even peppers. Folks in San Diego are real keen on eatin' organic, and there's a whole lotta demand for it. They got these farms that sell their food straight to folks, kinda like a club, and they're always got waitin' lists.  Organic eggs and milk are real popular too. Now, a lot of these organic farms, they're not just about the food. They let folks come out and see how they do things, even go for a hike or watch the birds.  It's a way for the farmers to make some extra dough, teach folks somethin', and it's good for the land. \n\n\nNow, organic farmin' ain't easy. It takes a whole lot more work, 'cause you can't just use all those chemicals to get rid of pests and weeds. And sometimes, you lose more crops than if you were usin' that stuff. Plus, a little farm like that can't compete with the big boys when it comes to makin' a profit.\n\nBut there's a whole lotta good things about it too. The land's healthier, you got more critters around, and that makes for a prettier place to live. So, if you're a farmer thinkin' about doin' things the organic way, there's some help out there. The government's got programs to help folks who wanna do right by the land and still make a livin'.\n\nTake this piece of land I found, right next to Potrero. It's got chaparral, some grass that ain't from around here, and some oak trees. It's right next to the forest, and there's all sorts of critters livin' there, some of 'em rare as hen's teeth. This land's been around for a long time, first the Native Americans lived there, then some folks came along and raised cattle and cut wood.\n\nNow, I found this organic farm not far away, and they're doin' things the right way. It gives you an idea of what could be done with that piece of land.",
            "Well, let me tell ya, culture is a big ol' deal when you're tryin' to get somethin' done. It ain't just about what a culture *is*, it's about what it ain't too. You can't just say \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese folks are nice as pie\" 'cause that ain't right.  Every culture's got its own way of doin' things, its own quirks and beliefs.  \n\nWhen you're dealin' with folks from a different place, you gotta remember that you're lookin' at it through your own lens. It's kinda like lookin' at a picture through a funhouse mirror, ya know? You can see the shapes, but they ain't quite right.\n\nSo instead of tryin' to change 'em or judge 'em, just gotta accept 'em for who they are and play along. Especially when you're the one who's got less to bargain with. It's like showin' respect when you're in someone else's house, ya gotta treat their stuff with care.\n\nNow, culture ain't just about countries, it's about companies too. Some companies are all about long hours and hard work, others are more laid back. You can tell a lot about a company by how folks dress, how they talk to each other, and who they hire. Some companies even encourage their employees to give back to the community, others are more focused on the bottom line.\n\nBut here's the kicker: even within a country, you'll find different cultures. Like back home in America, we got all sorts of different kinds of companies, from big corporations to small businesses, and each one's got its own way of doin' things.\n\nAnd then there's values. Those are the real heart of a culture, the reasons behind the actions. If a culture values respect and harmony, they ain't gonna embarrass their boss to get ahead. But a culture that values a hard bargain might hold out longer.\n\nSo, before you go in to negotiate with someone, it's good to do a little homework on their culture. But don't forget to get to know the person you're talkin' to too. That'll help you make a real connection and get somethin' done.",
            "So, these two fellas, Anselm and Aquinas, they both wanted to prove God exists, see? But they went about it different ways. Anselm, he's all about faith, like lookin' inside yourself and knowin'. He says, since we can even think about God, He's gotta be real, like, it's in our heads already.  He's sayin' you don't need no fancy proof, just trust what you know in your heart. \n\nNow, Aquinas, he's the kinda guy who wants facts, you know? He thinks you can prove God with your brain, like a puzzle. He lays out five reasons why God has to be there, like how things change, where stuff comes from, and how everything ain't just happenin' by itself. He's sayin' it all adds up to God bein' the missing piece. \n\nBoth of 'em got good points, but neither one's got the whole picture, ya know? It's like, Anselm's sayin' trust your gut, and Aquinas is sayin' use your noggin. But neither one's gonna convince everyone.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya 'bout this fella, Buddha, back in the ol' days, like way back when folks were just starting to figure things out.  He was some kinda prince, but he got tired of all that fancy livin'.  So, he said \"screw this\" and went off to find the truth. Turns out, he found it, became all wise and stuff, and started preachin'.  People listened, liked what he had to say, and bam!  Buddhism was born. Now, this one branch of Buddhism, called Theravada, is like the original recipe, been around for over 2,500 years.  But times change, right?  Even Buddha wouldn't recognize it today.  Like, in Sri Lanka, they do this water-cuttin' thingy every year.  Monks and regular folks, all chip in, and it's kinda important, even though Buddha never mentioned nothin' about it.  See, Buddhism ain't just about the big ideas, it's about the little stuff too, and it's changed over the years.  Both the monks and the regular folks who follow Buddha, they had to tweak their beliefs a bit.  Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad, sometimes it's just life, ya know?  We'll get into all the details, but first, let's talk about the basics.\n\nBuddhists, they believe in three things: the Buddha himself, his teachings (called \"Dhamma\"), and the community of followers (called \"Sangha\").  Think of it like a three-legged stool, all gotta be there.  The \"Dhamma\" is like the rulebook, all written down in these ancient texts called the Tripitaka.  There's the Sutta Pitaka, which is like the main preachin's, the Vinaya Pitaka, which is the monk's code of conduct, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, which gets all philosophical.  It's got all the heady stuff like \"Anatta\" (no soul), \"Dukkha\" (life is suffering), and \"Anicca\" (everything changes).  Get these ideas, and you can escape the cycle of death and rebirth, called \"Sansara\".  No more sufferin', no more desire, no more anger, no more delusion, just peace.  Now, the Vinaya Pitaka, it lays out the rules for folks who follow Buddha.  Regular folks gotta follow five rules: no killin', no lyin', no stealin', no messin' around, and no gettin' drunk.  Monks, they gotta follow a whole bunch more.  But the most important thing, the whole foundation of Buddhism, is the Four Noble Truths.  First, life is suffering.  Second, why we suffer is because we cling to things.  Third, we can stop suffering.  And fourth, there's a way to stop suffering, and that's through the Eightfold Path.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya 'bout these here U.S. and Mexico fellas. They got themselves in a right ol' tussle back in the day, lasted somethin' like 57 years, from '36 to '93.  You know, like two brothers fightin' over the last piece of pie.  They even went to war over it, back in '46 and '48, the U.S. took Texas and all that southwest land from Mexico.  \n\nNow, ain't this somethin' like when your neighbors always stealin' your lawnmower or somethin'?  Countries sometimes squabble over land, resources, and beliefs, ya know?\n\nThese two, they clashed over religion, culture, tradition, and even money.  Ain't that somethin'?  Just like how folks get their noses outta joint over who got the best BBQ sauce!\n\nYou see, the U.S. and Mexico, they're like those two brothers always at it.  The U.S. had a real hankerin' for Mexico's land, kinda like that fella who always wants the biggest slice of cake.  \n\nReligion played a part too, just like when folks argue over who's got the right way to worship.  Americans back then, they weren't too keen on Catholics, kinda like how folks might not get along if one's a hunter and the other's a tree hugger.\n\nAnyway, they had all sorts of disagreements, 17 of 'em, if you believe them books.  Most of it was over land and folks crossin' the border.  It was like a big ol' border dispute, with outlaws and bandits makin' trouble.\n\nBut eventually, Mexico kinda had to rely on the U.S. for help, kinda like when your neighbor needs to borrow your tools.  And the U.S., they started lookin' at Mexico's money more than their land.  So, the fightin' died down, like when two kids finally get tired of bickerin'.",
            "Fifteen years ago, somethin' happened to me outta nowhere. This sickness, one I never even knew existed, hit me like a ton of bricks. I was a nurse back then, ya know? I went into it 'cause I wanted that safety and security, somethin' I never had growin' up. Everyone was always sayin', \"You'll always have a job, folks get sick all the time!\" So, even though I dreamed of bein' a scientist or maybe a journalist, somethin' like that, I stuck with nursing.  \n\nBut there I was, 46 years old, single, nothin' saved up, and couldn't work no more.  This sickness, it took everything from me. Fifteen years on disability now, and I'm nothin' but broke.  Every day's a fight, a struggle just to keep my head above water. My security, my safety, my pride, gone. Ain't nothin' for sure anymore, but one thing I know for sure: I couldn't have made it this far without my family and a few good friends. Believe me,  when disaster strikes, you feel mighty weak.\n\nLife throws curveballs, big and small. You can plan all you want, but some things are just too much to handle alone.\n\nI agree, we gotta stop relyin' on the government for everything. That whole system's rotten to the core.  But instead of everyone buildin' their own little fortresses, how about we start trustin' each other again? Help each other out, ask for help when we need it. That's what this country was built on: compassion, respect, and lookin' out for one another.\n\nSure, they talk about rugged individualism, but the truth is,  our forefathers didn't make it through tough times by themselves. It was by lookin' out for each other.\n\nSo yeah, be prepared. I am. Got my disaster kit, first aid, water purifiers, even plastic to cover the windows if things get real ugly. Flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, and enough canned goods to feed a small army. If you got the land, grow your own food, learn to can it. That's a good idea, just like a wood stove, as long as you ain't livin' in an apartment.\n\nBut here's the thing: get to know your neighbors.",
            "Listen up, folks! You ever wonder why critters are the way they are? Like, what makes 'em evolve into these crazy shapes? Well, some brainiacs back in the day, way back in 1917, said figuring out how life changes in math terms is like trying to herd cats! And guess what? They weren't too far off.  \n\nBut, some folks are tryin' somethin' new. They're usin' math to figure out how critters like these fancy snails, called Prunum, grow their shells. It's like, they take pictures of these shells, break 'em down into numbers, and then use computer programs to see what kinda crazy shell shapes they could come up with. \n\nThink of it like this: a shell's like a spiral staircase, goin' round and round.  Each step is a whorl, and the whole thing's built around a central pole, like the support in the middle. Now, these steps can grow bigger or smaller, and there are lines between 'em called sutures.  \n\nNow, imagine makin' a blueprint for this shell staircase. You gotta figure out how big each step is, how far apart they are, and how they all fit together. That's what these scientists are doin'! They're tryin' to figure out the rules of how these shells grow, and maybe even predict what kinda new shell shapes could pop up. It's like a puzzle, but with real live critters!",
            "Well, lemme tell ya, little ol' Indonesia ain't doin' too hot when it comes to keepin' babies alive. They been havin' the same old problems for the last ten years, nothin' much changin'.  \n\nSure, they doin' alright with clean water and bathrooms, hittin' all those fancy goals they got. But when it comes to makin' sure moms and babies are healthy, they fallin' way behind.  They ain't gonna make their goals by 2015 if they keep up like this.  \n\nWhy? Well, lemme break it down for ya.  They tryin' to say they got more midwives helpin' out with babies, 72% of 'em now.  But, a lot of these midwives are just regular folks, not real doctors.  They can't handle nothin' fancy, gotta get a real doctor if somethin' goes wrong. And that's why so many moms bleed to death after havin' babies.  \n\nThey also sayin' less babies are gettin' sick with diarrhea.  Maybe, maybe not.  They don't even know how many babies are gettin' checked after they born, so hard to say for sure.  But it ain't lookin' good.  \n\nNow, they doin' barely any C-sections, just 4%.  That's low, y'know?  In the cities, they doin' 7%, but out in the country, it's only 2%.  Seein' as how everybody goes to the city for fancy stuff, that's a problem.  Rich folks gettin' the good stuff, poor folks stuck with nothin'. \n\nThey got a whole lotta problems to solve, but the big question is:  Should they just keep doin' the same old thing, or should they fix the whole system?  Program-specific stuff is easier, quicker, and more focused.  But it can drain resources from other parts of the health system. \n\nThey need to decide what's gonna work best, and fast.  Babies ain't gettin' any younger!",
            "Victorian books are all about the little details and the fancy people who lived back then.  But there are two books, *Oliver Twist* and *Wuthering Heights*, that are kinda different. They have mystery and weird stuff going on, which wasn't really common in those books. This mystery stuff helps us understand the characters better, like what makes them tick and what they're really feelin'.\n\nHere's a bit from *Oliver Twist*:\n\n\"Suddenly, his head was full of all these confusing thoughts. He felt like he was walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were yelling at each other. He could almost hear them talking. Then he realized he was talking to them... But then BANG! Gunshots! He heard people yelling and saw flashes of light, and someone grabbed him and dragged him away. Through all this chaos, he kept feeling this weird pain that just wouldn't go away.\"\n\nThese books use mystery a lot, sometimes through dreams or things that feel like dreams. In *Oliver Twist*, these strange happenings show us what's going on inside Oliver's head, his hurts, and how he sees the world around him.  When he gets shot, it's like he's reliving it all over again in a dream, even though he's trying to find help. This part shows how out of control he is, how bad he's hurt, and those visions of Sikes and Crackit just make it worse.  He gets so overwhelmed that he doesn't even notice who's carrying him away. He's numb to everything except the pain, which is constant and scary now, not just a shock. It makes you wonder who's really in charge of his life, because it sure ain't him! This shooting shows that Oliver has zero control over anything. Even when he's in danger, he can't even try to fight back. It's like Fagin has broken him, making him give up hope. Otherwise, you'd think he'd at least try to save himself.\n\n\n*Wuthering Heights* also has mystery and dreams, but they work a little differently. *",
            "A couple years back, I was workin' in this after-school program, helpin' out the little rugrats with their schoolwork.  I was pretty good at English and readin', so that's what I mostly did. One day, this little fella named Adrian - think he was in third or fourth grade -  needed some extra help. Now, this kid was speakin' perfect English, but his readin' was all messed up.  Some letters, he'd read 'em fine, others, well, he sounded like a frog tryin' to sing opera!  It was mighty strange. I figured maybe he was just slow, but something didn't add up.   \n\nThen one day, while I was lookin' after a few stragglers, Adrian's momma walked in. Couldn't say a lick of English, just Spanish.  I was just learnin' a few words myself, but we managed to piece together what was goin' on. Turns out, Adrian knew how to read, just not the English alphabet real well.   \n\nI guess that's why he was havin' such a hard time.  It was like he knew the words, but didn't know how to put 'em together right.\n\nThat's when it hit me, see?  It ain't always as simple as it looks.  Even if a kid speaks English, readin' it can be a real struggle.  \n\nThat's why I'm sayin' we gotta do somethin' about the language barrier in schools, especially here in California.  Adrian's story shows us that it ain't always about the kid not knowin' the language, sometimes it's about knowin' the alphabet and how to put the letters together.\n\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' it's easy.  We gotta figure out what works best for each kid.  Dual language programs,  immersion, private tutors, ESL classes - all got their place, but there ain't no one-size-fits-all solution.  \n\nThe best thing to do is combine 'em all.",
            "Y'all ever think about what's bigger than us, you know? Like, somethin' we can't even wrap our heads around? Some folks go to church, others hit the temple, some try to figure it out on their own.  Lotta folks just go with what their parents taught 'em, but some, they say \"Nah, there ain't nothin' out there but what we can see.\" They live their lives in their own little world.\n\nMe, I've changed my mind about things a time or two, you know? What I thought was important one day, ain't so important the next. We all gotta figure out our own way, our own beliefs. We're all lookin' for somethin' to guide us, somethin' to make sense of it all.\n\nMy old man, he loved cardinals. We were sittin' on the porch one day, rain comin' down like crazy.  He was lookin' out at the storm, kinda like he was lost in thought. He wasn't lookin' so good, skinnier than usual, hair all thin. He didn't meet my eyes much that day. I felt kinda scared, you know? I wanted to tell him I loved him, but talkin' about it just seemed to make it all too real. So I just hugged him, sat next to him, and watched the rain.\n\nHe passed away a few months later, right before my 22nd birthday. They tried to help him with medicine and all that, but it didn't really work. He just suffered longer. God, what kind of God lets that happen, I thought. I didn't say no prayers, not that night.  If God was out there, he'd stopped listenin' to me a long time ago.\n\nI didn't want to watch him die. It was too hard. I wanted to remember him like he was, not like he was in pain. I knew him better than anyone else, better than his family did. I knew he wouldn't want me there. I just curled up in bed for a few days and waited for the news.\n\nNobody even called me.",
            "Alright, so this here \"Gothic Novel\" thing, it's like a real head-scratcher. You got folks sayin' it ain't got no depth, then you got others swearin' it's got this whole \"terrible sublime\" thing goin' on.  It's like a mix of old and new, kinda like my runnin' mate ideas, ya know?\n\nThis fella, Ian Watt, he wrote somethin' called \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel,\" and he says it's all a big ol' oxymoron 'cause it's both old and new.  He's talkin' 'bout how the first Gothic Novel, this \"Castle of Otranto\" by Horace Walpole, it took bits and pieces from old-timey romances and mixed 'em with this newfangled story-tellin' thing called the novel. Walpole, he called it a \"Gothic Story,\" and he used all sorts of theatrics and nature stuff to make it somethin' special. \n\nSee, back in the day, folks were usin' the word \"gothic\" for all sorts of things, like different people, styles, and even times. It was kinda like sayin' somethin' was old-fashioned or, well, kinda dumb compared to the \"modern\" stuff. But then you got this whole new way of tellin' stories, the novel, where the reader gets right up close and personal with the characters' thoughts and feelings.  And that's what made Gothic somethin' special, somethin' that could be both old and new at the same time.\n\nOne of the big things in Gothic Novels is this idea of \"Chivalry.\" You got these knights, brave and honorable, and the writers, well, they kinda miss that in folks these days.  Walpole, he was writin' during a time when things were pretty messed up politically, and he was scared about what the future held. Maybe he thought those \"good old days\" of chivalry had disappeared, and he wanted to bring 'em back.  In his book, you can see this in characters like Frederic. He's described as this prince who's been through a lot, suffered some tragedies, and is supposed to be dead. He's got all these chivalric traits, like a knight in shining armor. But, ya know, it's all kinda over-the-top, which kinda sets the stage for the whole Gothic thing, with all its drama and excitement.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya 'bout this 'supply chain' thing. It's like how ya get your stuff from wantin' it to havin' it in your hands.  It starts with a fella orderin' somethin', then it goes through all these steps: gettin' the stuff to make it, makin' it, stowin' it,  deciding where to keep it, gettin' it to the store, and finally, deliverin' it to ya!  This Keith Oliver fella, a smart guy, kinda made up the name 'supply chain management' back in '82. He said it's all about plannin', doin', and controllin' all those steps to make sure folks get what they want, quick and easy.\n\nNow, there are six big parts to this whole shebang: makin' it, gettin' the stuff, keepin' track of it, decidin' where to put it, movin' it around, and knowin' what's goin' on all the time.  Smart business folks use these six things to make sure their customers are happy.\n\nMakin' it's the first step. You gotta figure out when, where, and how to make the stuff.  Gotta know what folks want, right?  Look at the market, see what folks are buyin'. That tells ya what to make and how much. Then you gotta pick the right place to make it, one that can make it good and plenty, and keep the customers happy.  \n\nAfter that, it's all about plannin' when to do what and keepin' the makin' stuff in tip-top shape.  Makin' things right is real important, 'cause if you mess it up, it costs ya time and money in the long run.  I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target, and they had rules for everything, from how the workers dressed to how they got stuff off the trucks.  Keepin' things organized makes things run smooth.\n\nThe next big part is gettin' the stuff. That means figuring out where to get the stuff you need and who to trust to make it for ya.  Sometimes, you might have different parts of makin' somethin' in different places.  You gotta pick the best place for each part.  And sometimes, you gotta get help from other companies, 'cause they're good at somethin' ya ain't.  That's called \"outsorin',\" and it can make things faster and cheaper, but ya gotta make sure they do a good job.",

Now, Burma, that's that Southeast Asian country where them folks been havin' a real rough go of it. They got this military junta runnin' the show, and they ain't exactly known for their kindness. Back in 2007, they had these big protests, them monks all wearin' their saffron robes, callin' it the \"Saffron Revolution.\" The government tried to shut 'em down, started gettin' rough, even attacked the monasteries.  They threw journalists in jail and even killed one, just for bein' there, a fella named Kenji Nagai. \n\nNow, this ain't nothin' new, see.  Governments always tryin' to keep folks quiet, keepin' all the power to themselves.  Back in Roman times, them emperors thought they were gods, rule everything.  Even them Japanese emperors, they think they're gods too, sent down to lead folks with cell phones and, well, that hara-kiri business. And don't even get me started on our own President, Bush.  He and that Ted Haggard fella, head of Stupid People Worldwide, they're always talkin' on the phone.  \n\nYou see, it's happened before, all over the world.  Like back in '89, them folks in Tiananmen Square, tryin' to protest the Chinese government, and the government just went and cracked down on 'em, killed a whole bunch of 'em.  And then there was that Rwandan genocide, Hutu folks killin' Tutsis, just because.  And let's not forget Hitler and the Holocaust, rounded up all them Jews and...well, you know.",

Now, he wasn't always playin' the piano loud and flashy, but when he wrote music, man, it was somethin' else! He made tunes so fancy and complicated, they let each guy in the band show off their own style.  Ellington was like the ringmaster, settin' up the whole show so these guys could go wild and improvise.  But he also knew how to make sure everything fit together, like a well-oiled machine, makin' each note sound just right.  He knew how to make each instrument sing, and how to get them all workin' together like a team.  That's why he wrote some of the best jazz music ever!\n\nThis guy Grove, he wrote a book about music, and he said Ellington was a real innovator.  He used his singers like instruments, not just for singin' words, but for makin' the music sound different and more interesting. One of his tunes, \"Creole Love Call,\" shows how he did that. It ain't no normal song, it's like a conversation between a voice and the instruments. The singer starts smooth and sweet, then gets rougher later on. Then you got this trumpet player, he plays kinda quiet and sad, but it's still real soulful. Then comes the clarinet, screamin' high notes, like it's tryin' to reach the sky!  And the whole band jumps in, makin' it a real party.\n\nEllington used all kinds of tricks like that in his music, makin' it sound like nothin' you've ever heard before. He knew how to make everything fit together, from the singers to the brass to the rhythm section. He was a real genius!",
            "She's always felt like somethin' was missin'. Like there was a hole in her life that just wouldn't be filled. It started back when she was about 14, just gettin' into all that teenage stuff.  And it was still there at 17, three years later. By then, she figured out she wanted someone, not some shiny new gadget or somethin'. But no boys ever really caught her eye. Some tried to, ya know, win her over, but nothin' worked. She wondered about it a lot, tryin' to figure out why she didn't feel nothin' for anyone. She thought about it for years, had all these theories, but nothin' ever really stuck. So she just kept livin', always wonderin' about what she was lookin' for.\n\nLife at home was usually pretty chill. Her folks were good folks, always calm and collected. They never fought, and even when she was pushin' back, tryin' to be independent, they never really got upset. She was the wild one in a calm family, always full of energy and fun. People liked her, she was a real sweetheart. \n\nBut today wasn't a calm day. She was walkin' around the house, tryin' to figure out what she wanted to do with herself, when she heard her mom scream from the kitchen. It was a sharp, scared sound. She rushed in, worryin' somethin' was wrong.  \"Mom! Mom, what's happenin'?\" Her mom was on the floor, holdin' her side, makin' little \"ow\" sounds.  Her daughter rushed to her side. \"Ouch... sweetie... I... need you to take me to... the hospital.\" She was talkin' in short breaths, in pain. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to pick you up.\" Her mom pointed, and her daughter, strong from all the workouts she'd been doin', scooped her up and carried her to the car. She laid her mom down in the back and drove as fast as she could.\n\nThe hospital smelled like medicine and sickness, and she was scared, but all she could think about was gettin' her mom help. She carried her in and yelled for a doctor. A bunch of worried faces gathered around, they pushed a bed over and laid her mom on it. They rushed her off, and her daughter was left sittin' there, waitin' and worryin'.\n\nLater, they found out her mom had fallen off a step stool while reachin' for a vase.",
            "So listen up, folks! This here study is about this thing called the \"Mediterranean Diet,\" or \"Med diet\" for short.  It's like a fancy way of sayin' eat your veggies, drink some wine, and enjoy life!  They found that folks who follow this diet, especially the \"aMed diet\" which is like the Med diet on steroids, are less likely to get those nasty heart problems, like heart attacks and strokes.  \n\nSee, the aMed diet is all about eatin' good stuff like fruits, nuts, and fish, and cuttin' back on the fatty meats and bad fats.  Plus, you can have a little wine with dinner, which ain't bad!\n\nDoctors have been sayin' for a while now that this Med diet is good for ya, but this study really focused on strokes and heart attacks.  They followed a bunch of nurses for like 20 years and kept track of what they ate and if they got sick.\n\nThey used these fancy questionnaires to see what everyone was eatin', and they found that the nurses who ate the most like Mediterranean folks were less likely to have a heart attack or stroke.  It's like magic!\n\nSo there ya have it, folks.  Eat your fruits and veggies, drink some wine, and you'll be lookin' good for years to come!",
            "Listen up folks, 'cause this here's a story about how our country, the good ol' USA, went belly up back in 2007.  Jobs disappeared faster than a squirrel up a tree, houses were worth less than a used tire, and even the big, fancy companies went bust. This mess ain't over yet, so let's figure out what went wrong and how to fix it, you hear? Well, it all started with some politicians playin' fast and loose with money. They pushed banks and companies to hand out loans to folks who couldn't even pay the electric bill. And meanwhile, these big shots at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, they were packin' up those risky loans like Christmas presents, sellin' 'em off to everyone and their uncle.\n\nNow, when folks couldn't keep up with their payments, the whole house of cards came tumblin' down. Banks were left with nothin' but empty pockets, and they passed the blame around faster than a hot potato. This whole thing started back in '99, when President Clinton was tryin' to stay in the White House. He wanted to look good for reelection, so he loosened up the rules on loans.  Back then, a fella named Steven Holmes, he was writin' for the New York Times, said right then and there that this was a recipe for disaster. He said it'd be just like the savings and loan crisis back in the '80s.  Well, ol' Steve was a prophet, wasn't he? \n\nThings got even worse 'cause folks were borrowin' money they didn't have, buyin' houses they couldn't afford. It was a real wild west out there. And then, the bubble burst. The price of houses went down faster than a greased piglet at a county fair. The big investment banks, they were left holding the bag, drowning in mortgage debts. Some of 'em went belly up, some had to sell themselves for peanuts, and the government had to step in and save the rest.",
            "Alright, so there's this thing called exposition, right?  It's when you gotta lay out the story's background, kinda like explainin' things to a slowpoke.  Sometimes it can be good, like when you're really hookin' 'em in, but most times, it's like watchin' paint dry.   You know, when your readers are yawnin' and wishin' they were doin' somethin' else, like countin' the cracks in the sidewalk. \n\nNow, I'm sure y'all know the sayin', \"Show, don't tell,\" but even I, ol' Dr. Merlin, trip up sometimes and get stuck in a whole mess of tellin' instead of showin'.  It's like when you're talkin' to someone and you just keep babblin' on and on about everything that ever happened, instead of just lettin' them see it for themselves. \n\nExposition is like that talkin' fella in a movie who just spills the beans about everything.  It's like, \"Hey, listen up!  Here's the whole story, from start to finish!\"  \n\nAnd trust me, nobody wants to hear that.  You gotta make 'em feel it, make 'em see it, make 'em understand what's goin' on without you just tellin' 'em every little detail. \n\nLet's say you're writin' a story about a gal who falls head over heels for this fella, they get hitched, and then BAM!  He gets whacked right in front of her.  You wouldn't want to spend two whole pages just tellin' us all that, would ya?  \n\nNo sir, you'd wanna show us how much they loved each other, how special he was to her, and how much she's gonna miss him.  You'd want us to feel the pain, to understand why she's so heartbroken.  \n\nSee, that's what exposition's all about:  makin' it real, makin' it feelin', makin' 'em care.  Don't just tell 'em the story, show 'em the story.",
            "Man, lemme tell ya 'bout these newscasts I watched outta Columbus, Ohio. First one was NBC 4 this mornin' (August 13, 2011), live and all. Biggest story they had was this fella in Ashley, Ohio, stabbed his wife somethin' fierce. Didn't say her name, but the fella's name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mugshot, looked like a real piece of work. They only gave him two minutes or so, which seemed right for a story still cookin'. All they said was he stabbed her a bunch of times and got hauled away. \n\nNext up was this young fella, Travis Buyers, 18 years old, shot up in Sharon Woods. Critically injured, poor kid. No one caught yet, SWAT team lookin' for the shooter. That story felt short, ya know? Makes me wonder if it was 'cause he was a black man, or livin' in a black neighborhood. 'Cause you know how it goes, when a white kid or grownup gets in trouble, the media goes bonkers. But when it's a minority, they barely give 'em a mention. \n\nThey did talk about a bullet hole in a Med-Flight helicopter, though.  .22 caliber, they said, from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers offerin' five grand for any tips leadin' to the shooter. \n\nThen they had a little chat 'bout the rain and thunder comin' Saturday. Said it'd be in the eighties all weekend.  Short and sweet, like they wanted ya to keep watchin'. \n\nAnd then this robbery at a UDF on Clime Road, Columbus. They went on and on about the robber bein' a black man, dark-skinned, six-foot tall, a hundred and fifty pounds. Seemed like they were really hammerin' home that he was black, ya know? \n\nLast story was about this Rene Rodriguez, some kinda drug kingpin from Texas.  Convicted of sendin' weed to Ohio.  Funny thing, they said he got sentenced to \"300\" months, instead of just twenty-five years.  Maybe they thought that sounded meaner?  Oh, and they mentioned he was Hispanic, which didn't seem too important to the story, if ya ask me.",
            "Brothers, man, they got this bond, like, nothin' can break it. You know, like when you're watchin' your own reflection, except it's your brother. It's love, pride, jealousy, even anger, all mixed up in there.  You see yourself in him, the good and the bad. And when things get tough, that's when you really see what that bond is made of, right or wrong.  But it ain't always pretty. That bond, it comes with baggage, ya know?\n\nThis story, \"The Scarlet Ibis\", it's all about that brotherly love, the good and the bad. These two guys, they're out there in this beautiful place, tryin' to do somethin' that ain't gonna work out. There's this pride, see, and it's like a fire, burnin' hot.  It starts with the older brother, he wants somethin' out of his little brother, someone to keep up with him, someone to share all the adventures. But the little brother, Doodle, he's different. He's got this heart thing, ain't gonna last long, and he can't do all the stuff the older brother wants to do.  Makes the older brother mad, makes him feel like he's been robbed. He even thinks about, well, let's just say he ain't happy with Doodle.  But then Doodle smiles at him, and it's like somethin' melts inside him.  \n\nThe story goes on, and you see that pride growin', and then, bam!  It all comes crashin' down.  They go on this last trip, and things go bad.  One brother makes it out, the other...well, you gotta read the story to see what happens. But it's all about that bond, about how love and pride can both hurt like hell.",
            "Dang, that brain of ours is somethin' else!  It's like a complicated gizmo, always thinkin' and creatin'.   Back in the day, folks thought it was like a wax tablet, then a piece of papyrus, then a book, and now they're sayin' it's like a computer.   But listen, don't go gettin' too hung up on that, 'cause these fancy comparisons only go so far. \n\nSee, all this thinkin' starts with our senses.  They take all these things we feel and hear and see and turn 'em into electrical signals.   The brain then takes those signals and messes with 'em, kinda like a recipe, makin' sense of 'em from the bottom up and the top down.\n\nLet's say you see a black box on a white background.  The bottom-up stuff, that's like lookin' at the box's edges and color and sayin', \"Hey, that's a box!\".   But the top-down stuff, that's like your brain already knowin' what a box is and sayin', \"Yep, that's a box, gotta be!\"\n\nNow, once the brain's got all that info, it's gotta decide what's important.  It's like a filter, lettin' in the good stuff and blockin' out the rest.  You see a whole bunch of grass, but your brain ain't gonna bother with every single blade.  But if someone calls your name in a crowed room, bam!  Your brain's all ears.\n\nTo keep all this goin', the brain's gotta store the info, too.   There's all kinds of memory, like short-term and long-term.   \n\nImagine you read a word.  Your brain stores it in a bunch of different ways: how it looks, how it sounds, and what it means.  Then it holds onto it for a bit, like somethin' you're workin' on right now.  And if it's important enough, it gets tucked away in long-term memory, like a file cabinet in your brain.\n\nNow, how all that stuff gets organized is a mystery.   Some folks say it's like a web, where ideas are connected like threads.   But nobody's quite figured it out yet.",
            "Alright, so this Huxley fella, he's got some beef with all this fancy technology and the way our money system keeps pushin' it.  In his book \"Brave New World,\" he paints a picture of a messed up future where folks care more about bein' part of the crowd than bein' themselves.  They're all about instant gratification, like a bunch of kids hooked on candy.  And the big boss man, the World Controller, he's like the puppeteer, makin' sure everyone's thinkin' the same way.\n\nNow, some smart folks who study stuff like money and power, they call themselves Marxists, and they see right through Huxley's story. He's talkin' about how things like sameness and makin' everything into a product, that's the problem.  It's like he's sayin' that our system is rigged, and the folks at the top are keepin' the rest of us in the dark about how it really works.\n\nThink about it like this:  the common folks in Huxley's book, they're just slaves to their wants and needs. They're pumped up on instant pleasures, buyin' and spendin' like there's no tomorrow. The World Controller, he's the one pullin' the strings, makin' sure they stay happy and dumb.  It's like a big ol' illusion, man.\n\nAnd the worst part is, nobody even notices! They're too busy chasin' their own tails to see the bigger picture. They're like sheep, followin' the leader without question.  Love, real feelin's, they're all gone, replaced by this phony, plastic happiness.  It's a real bummer, ya know?\n\nSo Huxley's story, it's a warning. He's sayin' that if we don't wake up and see what's really goin' on, we're gonna end up just like those folks in \"Brave New World\" - trapped in a world of fake happiness and empty promises.",
            "I been goin' to this here University Park for a couple years now, 'bout two and a half, maybe four and a half semesters. Now, gettin' around this campus is a real pain in the neck for most folks, includin' me. Back when I was a freshman, they stuck me in one of them East Halls dorms, way out east, past the stadium and that big ol' Bryce Jordan Center. Walkin' from that place to classes over by Willard, right in the middle of campus, could take you nearly 25 minutes, especially if the weather was bein' a real crank, which it seems to do a whole lot 'round here in State College. I was talkin' to a fella who graduated just a bit before me, and he told me that these East Halls used to be way out in the sticks, surrounded by nothin' but empty land. But now, they built all these new things - sports fields, fancy buildings like that new Creamery and the health place, and a bunch of apartments. It's gettin' harder and harder to get around with all this new buildin' goin' on.\n\nSo, what's the answer? How are we gonna fix this mess?  In my book, the answer is bicycles.  But it ain't just about havin' bikes, it's about havin' a campus that works for folks who ride 'em.\n\n\nI was talkin' to my friend the other day, and he just got back into ridin' after takin' a break for a while. He said he couldn't believe he ever stopped. \"Bikes are the only way to go,\" he said, \"It ain't cool to ride one for a while there, but it's the best way to get around.\" Bikes are good for ya, both physically and for gettin' places. A bowl of oatmeal and a little peddlin' and you can go 30 miles or more. Now, I live off campus, just as far from the center of campus as some of them dorms. Best decision I ever made this year was buyin' a bike. I got class in that Thomas building every day, and it's a good 25-minute walk from my place. But on my bike, I can make it in 5 minutes if I'm peddlin' hard. \n\nThe only problem is, that road, Pollock Road, it's the straightest way to Thomas, but it ain't always the easiest to ride.  Yeah, walkin' is good too, but I'm too busy for that. If I didn't have my bike, walkin' would be the only way to get to class.  Walkin' to Thomas every day would take another 30-40 minutes out of my day, that's over two and a half hours every week. And that's not countin' all the other walkin' I'd have to do to get to class, appointments, and all that other stuff.  Just ain't got the time for that."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",

With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

And I wanna help families that are fallin' apart. I'm talkin' 'bout real help, the kinda that makes a difference.\n\nI believe in treatin' folks right, doin' the right thing, and always tryin' to be better.  It ain't just about social work, it's about livin' right.  See, I always wanted to help folks, but I didn't know how.  Back in school, I saw a lot of folks runnin' from their problems, doin' things that weren't right.  That's why I got my Psychology degree, figured it would help me understand.\n\nOne time, I met this young kid, just sixteen,  scared outta his wits.  His folks were treatin' him awful.  I knew I had to do somethin'. I talked to the cops, told 'em what I knew.  Turns out, the law couldn't do much, so they asked me to talk to the parents.  When I did, they were nervous, tryin' to make excuses for how they treated their own son.\n\nThat's when I knew, I gotta be a social worker. Gotta help these kids, protect 'em from folks who don't know how to treat 'em right.\n\nAnd let me tell ya, fairness matters. We say everyone's important, but we act like we all gotta be the same.  I ain't buyin' it. I'm gonna stand up for what's right, fight for the folks who can't fight for themselves.  I've always done that, standin' up against bullies, racists, anyone tryin' to push folks down.  That's my way, and it ain't gonna change.",
            "Well now, lemme tell ya 'bout this here sleep stuff.  Seems like there's two ways folks look at it: the insides of your head, and what's goin' on around ya. \n\nFirst, ya got the folks who say it's all in your genes, like inheritin' a bad back or a love for chili. They talk 'bout stuff like your brain cells and how they work, like that there orexin thingy.  They did some tests on mice, sayin' that these orexin fellas tell ya when to sleep and when to stay awake.  They found that messin' with these little fellas can make a mouse sleepy or wired.  So, if you got a messed up orexin, maybe that's why you can't sleep right.\n\nThen ya got the folks who say it's all 'bout your life, like your job, your fam, and who you hang with. They say things like where ya live, your money situation, and even what color ya are can mess with your sleep.  \n\nSo, this paper here is talkin' about both sides of this sleep story. They're lookin' at all the studies and tryin' to figure out which one makes more sense. They even talkin' 'bout different kinds of sleep problems, like when you just can't fall asleep or when you fall asleep but can't stay asleep.",
            "Alright, so this here paper's talkin' 'bout somethin' called Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD for short.  It's kinda like this, see?  Some folks, they hear just fine, but their brains, well, their brains ain't quite cuttin' it when it comes to understandin' what they hear.  Like, they can hear you talkin', but they might have trouble makin' sense of it all, or maybe they can't tell where the sounds are comin' from.  We're gonna break it down into three parts: what CAPD is, how ya tell if someone's got it, and what a teacher can do to help out a kid in the classroom that's dealin' with this.   \n\nFirst off, CAPD is like a glitch in the brain's sound center. It ain't that their ears ain't workin', it's that their brain's havin' trouble processin' all the sounds it's gettin'.  They might hear a word, but they can't quite figure out what it means, or they might hear lots of different sounds at once and not be able to tell 'em apart.   People first started talkin' 'bout this kinda thing back in the 50s, but it took a while to figure out what was goin' on.   \n\nNow, there ain't no one test that can tell ya for sure if someone's got CAPD, but there are ways to figure it out.  Doctors and teachers might use tests and watch how a kid listens and responds to sounds, seein' if they're havin' any trouble. It's kinda like when you're watchin' a kid play, you can tell if they're strugglin' with somethin' just by watchin' 'em.\n\nSo, what can a teacher do if they've got a kid in their class with CAPD? Well, that's what we're gonna talk about next.",
            "So, this play, Twelfth Night, it's sayin' somethin' about how usin' disguises, even if it works for a while, can mess ya up real bad. If you keep pretendin' to be someone you ain't, you might just lose yourself completely. The problem is, if you stop the charade, you might hurt people's feelings. See, some folks might not care if you tricked 'em, but others, they'll be real mad and think you're a phony.\n\nNow, when it comes to pretendin' to be the opposite gender, that's a whole other can of worms. It makes you wonder, why'd they even do it in the first place? Like, why ditch their own skin and try to be someone else? In Viola's case, it's about stayin' safe. She's in a new place, and she figures if she pretends to be a guy, folks won't mess with her so much. \n\nIt works, but now she's all alone, cut off from the other women. And to make things worse, she's so good at playin' the guy role that Olivia, this rich lady, falls for her! Olivia even calls her \"husband\", can you believe that? And then there's Orsino, the Duke, who's got feelings for Viola, even though she's playin' a dude. It's a whole tangled mess.\n\nBut maybe that's the point. Maybe this play is sayin' that pretendin' can help folks figure out what they really feel.  Olivia and Orsino, maybe they were hidin' some feelings they didn't even know they had. Maybe Olivia's not even really into Cesario, but she's just so used to lookin' at folks and judgin' 'em by their looks, that she falls for the act. Once she sees Sebastian, who's Viola's twin brother, she forgets all about Cesario.",

They done messed up real bad, killed a whole bunch of Ovaherero and Nama folks. Now, I ain't sayin' all the Germans were bad, mind ya. They ran things different in different places, just like folks do today. \n\nWhen them Brits took over in East Africa after the war, they found a whole lot of Africans could read and write, thanks to the Germans. Seems like they did alright in some places, like Kamerun. But down in South West Africa, it was a whole different story.\n\nThey basically left it up to those missionary folks to teach the natives, and the government didn't give 'em much help. But for the white folks, they built schools and made sure them missionaries were doin' things right.  Makes ya wonder what kinda thinking was goin' on there, huh?\n\nAnyway, long story short, most of the folks in South West Africa couldn't read or write after the Germans left. It was like they never even tried. Now, I'm not sayin' it was all the Germans' fault, but those policies they had sure didn't help.\n\nThere's a whole lotta books written about how the Germans ran things in their colonies, mostly by them Germans themselves back in the day. Then some folks from England started doin' some studies, comparin' how things were done in different places.\n\nOne fella, Cohen, he wrote a book about how things were different in South West Africa and East Africa. He said it all comes down to the fact that South West Africa had a lot more white folks livin' there. \n\nNow, South West Africa wasn't exactly a hotbed of activity, but it wasn't too bad either. There were a whole lot more white folks there than in any of the other German colonies.",

It's been around for about 40 years and it's got all kinds of flavors. It's like a big ol' potluck, everyone bringin' their own dish. Some folks like it dark and moody, others like it loud and fast.

It's like he's puttin' his own hopes and dreams on that canvas, ya know?\n\nThis guy, he wanted folks to think he was a real artist, to be respected by the fancy art crowd. But here's the catch: he was stuck between a rock and a hard place. He wanted to be accepted, but he also wanted to paint his own dang way.  \n\nNow, this Rousseau fella, he wasn't born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He worked for the government, collectin' tolls, and never had any fancy art lessons. He lost his wife and kids, too, which left him pretty heartbroken. So, he took up paintin' as a way to make somethin' of himself and find some peace. He wasn't tryin' to be all fancy and highbrow like some of the other artists, he just wanted to paint what he saw and felt.\n\nBut the art world, well, it can be a tough nut to crack.  He was startin' late compared to all the other artists makin' a name for themselves. He wanted to be part of that crowd, to be accepted, but he had to choose: follow the rules or stay true to himself. \"The Dream,\" that's where it all comes together, ya know? It's like a snapshot of his struggle, his desire to be recognized and his fear of losin' his own voice.",
            "A whole bunch of smart folks have said that ethics and beauty are like two sides of the same coin. I reckon they're right. Like that poet Keats said, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\"  We learn most things in life by reading books or doin' things, but we just kinda *know* when somethin's right or wrong, or when somethin's beautiful, without havin' to think too hard about it.  \n\nEthics and beauty ain't about tellin' ya what to do or what to think. It's more about tryin' to figure out *why* somethin' is beautiful or why somethin' is right. Like, when we talk about a painting bein' good, we might talk about the colors and the shapes, but that don't really explain why it makes us feel somethin'. It's like when you're asked about your favorite song, you just gotta say, \"There's just somethin' about it,\" ya know?\n\nSame goes for morals. We can talk about right and wrong all day long, but it's hard to put it into words. It's like Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way.\" There's always somethin' more to it than just the words.  \n\nI think that's what makes art and morals so powerful. They touch somethin' deep inside us that we can't always explain.  It's like when you read a good book, or see somethin' truly beautiful. It just makes ya feel somethin'. And I think that's why they're so connected.",
            "Germany today is a powerful country, united and full of its own unique culture. You can feel this culture everywhere, from Munich in the shadow of the Alps all the way to Kiel by the Baltic Sea. It's the same story from Cologne on the Rhine River, through the heart of Germany, and to Dresden, that cool Saxon city on the Elbe.  It makes sense that Germany, as we know it now, came from all sorts of different places and people.\n\nThe land we know as Germany has been home to Germans for ages. Where the name \"Germany\" came from is something folks still argue about. Some say it comes from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, back when they lived across the Rhine River and fought those Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar, way back when, first used the word \"Germanus\" in his writings about the Gallic Wars. He used it to tell the difference between the Gauls he conquered and those pesky Germanic tribes who kept crossing the Rhine (Caesar, 50-40 BC). Some think he got the word from the Gauls themselves.  Others think it comes from the spear they used in battles, called a \"ger\" (O.E.D, 2010), or maybe from an old Irish word meaning \"to shout,\" because, well, Germans were known for being loud (Names of Germany).\n\nTacitus, a Roman historian, wrote way back in 98 AD about the origins of the Germans. He said they were the original people in Germany, not mixed with anyone else (Tacitus, 98).  He thought it would be crazy for anyone to leave Asia, Africa, or even Italy to come to Germany! Who would want to live in a wild, cold place with grumpy people? (Tacitus, 98).\n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germany? Not the Romans, not at first anyway. They might send out armies to grab stuff from Germany or fight battles, but they mostly just went back home to their big empire.  As the Germanic tribes popped up around the first century, they lived right on the edge of the Roman Empire. They traded goods they took from the land and even fought for the Romans in their army (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "Man, I was lookin' at this thing, just starin' at it.  My mind was workin' but not really gettin' anywhere. I was takin' it all in, you know, like a scientist or somethin', but it wasn't clickin' for me.  Thoughts were poppin' up and disappearin' faster than a fly at a picnic. It was like my brain was on autopilot, just processin' the sights without really thinkin' about 'em. \n\nThis one time, this art fella I knew told me about this book, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\"  I always wanted to learn how to draw, ever since I was a kid, and this book promised to teach ya everything, even how your brain makes sense of lines.  One trick it had was to put a square around whatever you're lookin' at, like a frame.  So, instead of lookin' at this whole mess, you're just focusin' on that one part, like a bowl of fruit on a table.  \n\nBut lookin' at this thing, I couldn't picture that frame. I was just overwhelmed, man.  Like, Picasso had his blue period, Monet loved green, and all those fancy Italian guys painted with every color under the sun. I was tryin' to think, \"Maybe this is my thing, my art, my story.\" But all I could think was, \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nSo there I was, holdin' this thing, my hand ready to go.  My muscles were tensed up, like I was about to do somethin' important. And then I did it.  Water swirlin', clean and clear, stuff fallin' away.  My hand went for the toilet handle again, this time with more force. I swear, that brown thing was stuck like glue.  \n\nMop in one hand, lookin' like a fool in my green tie, I stared at this mess someone left behind.  A few more flushes, a few more moments of quiet contemplation, and then I reached for the toilet paper.  I wrapped it around my hand like I was mummifyin' somethin'.  \n\nI stood up straight, then bent over, my hand reaching into the bowl, like I was checkin' on a turkey in the oven...",
            "Listen, folks, these young whippersnappers are dyin' behind the wheel! It ain't just some fluke, there's a whole bunch of stuff goin' on, ya know?  The big brains at the National Institutes of Health say those teen brains ain't even ready for the danger of drivin', just plain greenhorns, that's all.  And that lack of experience, well, it's a recipe for disaster. More crashes, more rollovers, even more speedin' and drivin' off the road, ya hear?\n\nNow, ain't nothin' worse than those teenagers cruisin' around with their buddies, and we all know they do it all the time.  Some fancy-pants group in California did a study, showed it plain as day – the more buddies in the car, the more trouble they get into.\n\nSo California and some other states, they're tryin' to help out, givin' these young'uns temporary licenses, limitin' their hours and who they can have in the car.  But that's like puttin' a bandage on a bullet wound, ya know?\n\nThe real problem is, these kids just ain't ready to handle the car, plain and simple. Some smart fella, Marvin Zuckerman, he says 18 ain't even old enough! He's done some studies, shows that young folks just love to take risks, get that thrill, ya get me?  So maybe we should wait a bit longer, let 'em grow up some, before they're behind the wheel.\n\nWe keep lettin' 'em drive, it's gonna be a bloodbath out there! All those baby boomers' kids, they'll be drivin' soon, and it'll be chaos!  We need new laws, somethin' to keep these kids safe. Schools can teach 'em about drivin', but no one under 18 gets behind the wheel, plain and simple.  Then maybe a temporary permit, and some practice with a grown-up.\n\nLook, it ain't rocket science, folks! We gotta do somethin' before more kids end up in the graveyard. National laws, that's what it takes.  We can save lives, I tell ya!",
            "So I was lookin' through these old Edison movies, see, the ones from way back when, and I found a bunch of these trick films.  There were fifteen of 'em, made between 1895 and 1901.  These movies, they ain't your regular stuff, they use some fancy editing tricks to make ya think things are happenin' that ain't.\n\nI spent a good amount of time lookin' at these flicks, tryin' to figure out how they worked their magic.  Most of 'em, they stick to the same old ways, ya know? They're shot in one spot, like they're on a stage, and the camera just sits there, no movin' around.  They use long shots and medium shots, never gettin' close up on nothin'.  And each movie, well, it's like one big idea, one shot, boom, it's over.\n\nBut then there's a few of these later ones, they start doin' somethin' different, like usin' more than one shot in a movie. It's like they're tryin' something new.\n\nOne thing that's real common in these trick films is that they're all shot inside, like they're on a stage.  The camera just sits there, watchin' the action go on, never movin'. Kinda like how they used to do it in vaudeville shows.  So the folks in the movies, they just walk back and forth, never comin' closer or goin' further away from the camera.\n\nAnd because they're all shot in one spot, they use long shots and sometimes medium shots, but never nothin' close up. That's 'cause they wanted folks to see the whole thing, just like at a play.\n\nAnd these movies, they're real short, just a minute or less, 'cause each one is like one big idea. They're mostly just a bunch of little tricks, like makin' somethin' disappear or reappear, kinda like magic.\n\nNow, here's the thing, sometimes what looks like one shot in the movie, it might actually be a bunch of shots put together to make the trick work.  Take this one movie, \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots,\" for instance. It looks like it's all one shot, but if you look real close, you can see where they cut between shots to make it look like her head's been cut off.",
            "This John Taylor fella, he was all about bein' a good ol' Republican, ya know?  He was a farmer, through and through, but even him talkin' politics, he was a straight shooter, always speakin' his mind about freedom and how the government should run. See, he thought farm life was the best, and that's what shaped his whole view on everything. He wanted to keep things simple, protect the farmers, and that's what drove his ideas about the government, the Constitution, even the courts.\n\nJohn believed America had a real shot at buildin' somethin' special, somethin' better than what Europe had.  Since we didn't have all that old-world baggage, we could start fresh, build a system where folks could govern themselves. He was all about folks havin' rights, natural rights, that's what he called 'em, and he said if one right gets messed with, they all start fallin' apart. Government shouldn't be messin' with those rights none. He said back in the \"wild west,\" the strong guys always took what they wanted, but in a civilized society, that ain't right.\n\nTo make this perfect society, John thought we needed a government that understood both the good and bad in people. He was a firm believer in good and evil, that folks are born with 'em both. He said, \"Government's run by people, so it's gonna have all the good and bad that people have.\"  He thought good government protected your stuff, helped farmers, and kept people from gettin' too greedy.  He believed even if a government was run by scoundrels, it'd still work if it was built on those good principles.\n\nHe thought folks are naturally selfish, but that's not always bad. It's only bad when folks get greedy and try to take advantage of others.  A good government keeps folks in line, but we gotta watch it close so it don't start doin' bad things itself.\n\nJohn, like a lot of his Republican friends, wanted a government that stuck to the Constitution. He wanted it small and simple, just doin' what the Constitution said, nothin' more. He knew a big government cost a lot of money and could easily turn into a tyrant. But he said just readin' the words ain't enough, gotta understand what the fellas who wrote it meant. He thought the Declaration of Independence was more important, 'cause it said America was a bunch of states, each lookin' out for themselves, not one big country.",
            "Alright, so listen up, we had this project, see, and it was about gettin' folks to ditch their cars and  walk or bike to work.  Figure 17, that there chart, shows things went south around the third month. Kinda bummed us out, to be honest.  \n\nNow, it's New England, so winter hit hard, right?  Folks ain't walkin' or bikin' much when it's snowin' or freezin'. December, that's when the semester ends, everyone's swamped with schoolwork and whatnot.  Fillin' out a log for the project?  Yeah, that probably slipped their minds.  Then December's when the holidays hit, and everyone's scatterin' for the hills.  Students and teachers gone, ain't nobody on campus for a whole month.  Come January, things start up again, but by then, the log entries are still low.  \n\nNow, I reckon any project starts with a bang, folks all excited, then it fades a little.   To try and keep things goin', we had this \"Carpool Challenge Week\" in March, like a big ol' push to get folks back on track.  Worked, too, entries went up.  But heck, keepin' things movin' when folks are busy or on break? That's a challenge right there.\n\nAnother thing is, folks love their cars.  It's part of our culture.  Gotta give 'em somethin' to make 'em wanna ditch the wheels.  We gave out gift cards, you know, to restaurants, coffee shops, even massage places.  But I wonder if somethin' bigger woulda worked, like a shiny new bike, a hybrid car, or maybe even a fancy electric one.  \n\nThe prizes stayed the same the whole time.  Maybe if we'd upped the ante, like sayin', \"Hey, in December, we're givin' away bikes!\" and then, in January, \"And in January, it's a hybrid car!\"  Maybe that'd have kept folks interested.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya 'bout these fancy things called ETFs, they're like index funds but fancier, kinda like a stock but traded on the market. You know how index funds track somethin' like the whole market, but ETFs are more like pickin' a few stocks to follow.  And here's the deal, they're cheaper than those mutual funds, but ya gotta pay a little somethin' somethin' each time ya buy or sell 'em, just like regular stocks.  The good thing about ETFs is there's a whole bunch of 'em out there, so ya can find one for just about anything.  Now, some folks say ETFs give ya all the good stuff of a fund, like spreadin' your money around, but ya gotta look close and make sure they ain't just talkin' a big game.  \n\nNow lemme tell ya 'bout this one ETF, IHF, I'm gonna compare it to the top ten stocks it's made up of. I'm gonna see if just buyin' those ten stocks straight up is better than buyin' the whole ETF.  \n\nSee, these ten stocks make up most of what's in the ETF, like 63% or somethin'.  So we're gonna see if they act like the whole ETF, like if they make the same kinda money or have the same kinda risk.  I'm gonna figure out somethin' called \"Beta,\" which tells ya how risky somethin' is, and \"return,\" which is how much money ya make.\n\nWell, turns out, the ten stocks made a little more money than the whole ETF, like 6% more. And they were a little less risky too.  So it looks like buyin' those ten stocks straight up might be a better deal. But I gotta make sure it ain't just luck, ya know?\n\nSo I'm gonna check somethin' called \"standard deviation,\" which tells ya how much the price of somethin' goes up and down. If the ten stocks are less risky than the ETF, then maybe buyin' just those ten stocks is the way to go.",
            "Alright, so Poe, he thought \"Dream-Land\" was one of his best poems, ya know? Now, in this poem, he uses this word \"Thulé\", like a fancy name for a place.  Turns out, some smart guy named Mabbott figured out that Poe got this word from an old fella named Virgil. Virgil wrote about this island called Thulé way up north, past Britain, where folks back then thought the world ended.  Now, Virgil definitely used the word, but there's this other guy, Goethe, who Poe really liked.  Poe was a big fan of German writers. \n\nThis whole thing about Thulé is important 'cause it shows Poe knew his stuff, ya know? This guy, Arndt, wrote a book comparing Poe's poem to Goethe's, and he thinks Poe was basically copying him.  \n\nGoethe was a big deal back then. This book of his called \"Faust\" was super famous, with two parts, one in 1808 and the other when he died, 1832.  There's this little poem in the second part of \"Faust\" called \"The King of Thulé.\" It's about this king who loses his wife, and after she dies, he just drinks and cries all the time.  He's so sad he decides to die too, and he gives away everything except this fancy goblet his wife gave him. He goes to a cliff, throws the goblet in the ocean, closes his eyes, and that's it.\n\nNow, the King of Thulé, he's kinda like Poe's character in \"Dream-Land,\" maybe a dark reflection of Poe's own sadness and drinking problems.  \"Faust\" was even made into a play in 1842, just before Poe used the word \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"  \n\nPoe only uses \"Thulé\" a couple of times in his writing. Once in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and twice in \"Dream-Land\" at the beginning and end of the poem.  You could almost read them together, like they're friends. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker talks about this dark, lonely place called Thulé, haunted by dead friends, and everything's just gray and sad.  It's like he's stepped right into the King of Thulé's story.\n\nGoethe was a big shot, and Poe would've known him, even if it was just 'cause Poe liked Tennyson. Plus, everyone was copying Goethe back then.",
            "So, some lady named Jennifer Palmer went and slipped on some applesauce in a grocery store, hurt her back real bad.  Now she's trying to sue the store, sayin' the manager knew about the spill and didn't clean it up for half an hour 'cause he was busy eatin' dinner. She wants the store to pay her extra money, kinda like a punishment, 'cause she says the manager was bein' a real jerk. \n\nSee, in California, ya gotta prove the store manager did somethin' real bad on purpose, like he meant to hurt her or was just plain nasty.  The lady's sayin' he knew folks were slipin' and fallin' on spills all the time, but still didn't care. That's a pretty good argument, maybe even mean enough to get her extra money.\n\nIt all happened back in 2009.  Two employees told the manager, Paul, about the spilled applesauce. He just told 'em to go away 'cause he was eatin'.  Then, half an hour later, Jennifer goes and slips, hurts herself somethin' fierce.\n\nThe lady's lawyer is sayin' this ain't just a simple accident, it's like the manager was willfully ignorin' the danger, like he didn't care if someone got hurt. That's what they mean by \"despicable\" I guess.\n\nSo now the judge's gotta decide if the manager was really that bad, bad enough to pay extra money.  That's a tough one, huh?",
            "Y'all know, back when I took that Islam class at CBC, like four years ago, we talked a lot about whether Islam was a mean religion or not. Seems even more important now, don't ya think? After 9/11, the media went from really hating on Muslims and folks like that to bein' all soft on 'em. Like, could you imagine back in 2001 havin' a president named Barack Obama, with his Muslim family history? No way!\n\nNow, this book about Muhammad, it's got me confused. See, I always thought he was a real tough guy, conquerin' tribes and makin' 'em turn Muslim. But this book paints him as a martyr, misunderstood and humble. People just came to him, seein' the truth in his words.  It's like they're tryin' to make him out to be some kinda saint.\n\nAnd get this - there are some things about Muhammad's story that sound a lot like stuff Jesus did. Like, he turned milk and meat into enough for forty guys! It makes me wonder if they're tryin' to steal Jesus' thunder, y'know? They're downplayin' Jesus' miracles to make Muhammad look bigger.\n\nThe book also tells a lot of stories about folks convertin' to Islam on their own, but it's all hearsay. They say \"So-and-so told me, who heard it from so-and-so.\" Makes it sound fishy to me.\n\nWhat really bothers me is how they try to make Muhammad seem so perfect, humble, and wise. But history ain't got nothin' on that, no sir. I just can't believe Muslims today know the whole story about how Muhammad got so powerful.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya, it seems like them fancy theologians done went and changed up Jesus's teachings somethin' fierce since he kicked the bucket. Kinda like how my buddy took my pool plans and made 'em his own, but didn't ask first.\n\nLook, the world's gettin' more open-minded every day, like a rusty gate finally swingin' open. Now, some folks are stuck in their ways, like a mule in a ditch, but they ain't gonna change the whole darn world. More and more folks are gonna start lookin' back and seein' what got added to Christianity over the years, stuff that wasn't even in Jesus's playbook.\n\nIt might take a while, maybe decades or even longer, but mark my words, things are gonna change. It'll be like rewindin' a VCR, goin' back to the basics, back to Jesus's original message. Imagine folks gettin' rid of all that extra stuff, layer by layer, until all that's left is Jesus himself, plain and simple.\n\nThis change is gonna sweep through America and Europe faster than a wildfire, and folks are gonna start worshipin' like it's the good ol' days back when Jesus walked the earth. The church, well, they'll be leadin' the way, but things are gonna be different.\n\nAll these different churches, all these different ideas, it's gonna start to fade away. It'll be more like one big family again, everybody singin' from the same hymn book.\n\nHistory's full of these big changes, like when the Romans went from persecutin' Christians to becomein' Christians themselves. Or how America went from slavery to havin' Black folks leadin' the way.\n\nThis time, it's gonna be about Christianity, goin' back to its roots, gettin' rid of all the fancy stuff, and comin' together as one.\n\nAnd here's the secret sauce: folks are gonna start seein' Jesus's words differently, not just as plain words, but like stories and symbols.\n\nNow, let's talk about where it all started.\n\nWay back in the day, before Jesus came along, there was Judaism. It was all about one God, God's word, and the Hebrew scriptures.\n\nThe Jewish folks weren't all on the same page, though. They had their own groups, like the Sadducees, the Pharisees, the Essenes, and the Zealots.",
            "Listen,  this book, \"The Jungle\", it shows us how folks, deep down, they're just plain greedy.  It's all about lookin' out for number one, ya know? They don't give a hoot about anyone else, especially if they're not makin' them rich.  \n\nYou see it right there in the bosses of these big factories. They just wanna make their companies bigger and bigger, no matter who gets hurt along the way.  They don't care about the smoke pourin' outta their chimneys, or the stinkin' mess from all the animals around the place.  It's all about the money, see?  Like that author, Sinclair, he says, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". That's how bad it was, man. \n\nAnd the bosses, they don't care about their workers neither. They'll work 'em 'til they drop, then fire 'em without a second thought.  Back then, there weren't no rules protectin' folks, so the bosses could do whatever they wanted. It was a real dog-eat-dog world in that Packingtown. \n\nThe workers were treated worse'n dogs, like slaves.  They were workin' themselves to death, but nobody helped 'em. Even the unions were just lookin' out for themselves. They were makin' money off the backs of the poor folks. \n\nIt's a real sad story, man. Just shows how greed can corrupt people, and how the powerful can take advantage of the weak.",
            "Some writers, they got tricks for makin' ya feel somethin' 'bout what they're writin', ya know? Some ways work better'n others. F. Scott Fitzgerald, he's one smart fella, he uses all kinds of tricks in his book, \"The Great Gatsby\". Sometimes he'll put words together that don't usually go together, like a \"blue banana\", just to make ya feel somethin' different about somethin'. Other times, he'll pick a color or somethin', give it a meaning, and then use that same color to make ya feel that same way 'bout somethin' important. He does that with colors all the time, like gold, green, white, gray, and even red and pink. \n\nIn \"The Great Gatsby\", he builds up meanings for these colors, especially white and gray, and then uses 'em to make ya remember somethin' 'bout somethin' important. He uses white and gray to mean, well, kinda like boring sameness, like everything's the same. White's a bit fancier, and gray's more like old and worn out. He starts doin' this right at the beginning of the book. Daisy and Jordan are always wearin' white, like all the time! Nick wears white pants to Gatsby's party, Tom's wearin' a white shirt when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine's all pale and white.  The only time folks ain't wearin' white is when Nick's gettin' a feel for Gatsby's party, and then it's all bright colors, like nothin' like white. He uses these colors to describe all sorts of things, too, like Nick goin' to work down these white streets, or  names at Gatsby's party lookin' gray on Nick's list. Catherine's apartment, it's like a big white cake, all the same. He even uses white and gray for folks and places that ain't nothin' special, like Jordan and Daisy's childhood, the cars and the land in the valley of ashes, even a little kid and an old dog seller.\n\nAfter he's used white and gray enough, he starts usin' 'em to show that somethin' ain't important or that it's just the same as everything else. He does this with Daisy first. After he don't use white or gray for a while, he starts describin' Daisy wearin' white in a white car. Now, we start seein' Daisy as less of a real person and more like somethin' Gatsby just wants, somethin' plain and boring. He keeps doin' this with Daisy, like describin' her fur collar as a gray haze. It's all about makin' ya feel somethin' about Daisy, somethin' kinda flat and empty.",
            "San Diego's weather is perfect for growin' crops, y'all.  They got tomatoes, citrus, greens, squash, broccoli, all sorts of herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, even peppers. Folks in San Diego are real keen on eatin' organic, and there's a whole lotta demand for it. They got these farms that sell their food straight to folks, kinda like a club, and they're always got waitin' lists.  Organic eggs and milk are real popular too. Now, a lot of these organic farms, they're not just about the food. They let folks come out and see how they do things, even go for a hike or watch the birds.  It's a way for the farmers to make some extra dough, teach folks somethin', and it's good for the land. \n\n\nNow, organic farmin' ain't easy. It takes a whole lot more work, 'cause you can't just use all those chemicals to get rid of pests and weeds. And sometimes, you lose more crops than if you were usin' that stuff. Plus, a little farm like that can't compete with the big boys when it comes to makin' a profit.\n\nBut there's a whole lotta good things about it too. The land's healthier, you got more critters around, and that makes for a prettier place to live. So, if you're a farmer thinkin' about doin' things the organic way, there's some help out there. The government's got programs to help folks who wanna do right by the land and still make a livin'.\n\nTake this piece of land I found, right next to Potrero. It's got chaparral, some grass that ain't from around here, and some oak trees. It's right next to the forest, and there's all sorts of critters livin' there, some of 'em rare as hen's teeth. This land's been around for a long time, first the Native Americans lived there, then some folks came along and raised cattle and cut wood.\n\nNow, I found this organic farm not far away, and they're doin' things the right way. It gives you an idea of what could be done with that piece of land.",
            "Well, let me tell ya, culture is a big ol' deal when you're tryin' to get somethin' done. It ain't just about what a culture *is*, it's about what it ain't too. You can't just say \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese folks are nice as pie\" 'cause that ain't right.  Every culture's got its own way of doin' things, its own quirks and beliefs.  \n\nWhen you're dealin' with folks from a different place, you gotta remember that you're lookin' at it through your own lens. It's kinda like lookin' at a picture through a funhouse mirror, ya know? You can see the shapes, but they ain't quite right.\n\nSo instead of tryin' to change 'em or judge 'em, just gotta accept 'em for who they are and play along. Especially when you're the one who's got less to bargain with. It's like showin' respect when you're in someone else's house, ya gotta treat their stuff with care.\n\nNow, culture ain't just about countries, it's about companies too. Some companies are all about long hours and hard work, others are more laid back. You can tell a lot about a company by how folks dress, how they talk to each other, and who they hire. Some companies even encourage their employees to give back to the community, others are more focused on the bottom line.\n\nBut here's the kicker: even within a country, you'll find different cultures. Like back home in America, we got all sorts of different kinds of companies, from big corporations to small businesses, and each one's got its own way of doin' things.\n\nAnd then there's values. Those are the real heart of a culture, the reasons behind the actions. If a culture values respect and harmony, they ain't gonna embarrass their boss to get ahead. But a culture that values a hard bargain might hold out longer.\n\nSo, before you go in to negotiate with someone, it's good to do a little homework on their culture. But don't forget to get to know the person you're talkin' to too. That'll help you make a real connection and get somethin' done.",
            "So, these two fellas, Anselm and Aquinas, they both wanted to prove God exists, see? But they went about it different ways. Anselm, he's all about faith, like lookin' inside yourself and knowin'. He says, since we can even think about God, He's gotta be real, like, it's in our heads already.  He's sayin' you don't need no fancy proof, just trust what you know in your heart. \n\nNow, Aquinas, he's the kinda guy who wants facts, you know? He thinks you can prove God with your brain, like a puzzle. He lays out five reasons why God has to be there, like how things change, where stuff comes from, and how everything ain't just happenin' by itself. He's sayin' it all adds up to God bein' the missing piece. \n\nBoth of 'em got good points, but neither one's got the whole picture, ya know? It's like, Anselm's sayin' trust your gut, and Aquinas is sayin' use your noggin. But neither one's gonna convince everyone.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya 'bout this fella, Buddha, back in the ol' days, like way back when folks were just starting to figure things out.  He was some kinda prince, but he got tired of all that fancy livin'.  So, he said \"screw this\" and went off to find the truth. Turns out, he found it, became all wise and stuff, and started preachin'.  People listened, liked what he had to say, and bam!  Buddhism was born. Now, this one branch of Buddhism, called Theravada, is like the original recipe, been around for over 2,500 years.  But times change, right?  Even Buddha wouldn't recognize it today.  Like, in Sri Lanka, they do this water-cuttin' thingy every year.  Monks and regular folks, all chip in, and it's kinda important, even though Buddha never mentioned nothin' about it.  See, Buddhism ain't just about the big ideas, it's about the little stuff too, and it's changed over the years.  Both the monks and the regular folks who follow Buddha, they had to tweak their beliefs a bit.  Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad, sometimes it's just life, ya know?  We'll get into all the details, but first, let's talk about the basics.\n\nBuddhists, they believe in three things: the Buddha himself, his teachings (called \"Dhamma\"), and the community of followers (called \"Sangha\").  Think of it like a three-legged stool, all gotta be there.  The \"Dhamma\" is like the rulebook, all written down in these ancient texts called the Tripitaka.  There's the Sutta Pitaka, which is like the main preachin's, the Vinaya Pitaka, which is the monk's code of conduct, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, which gets all philosophical.  It's got all the heady stuff like \"Anatta\" (no soul), \"Dukkha\" (life is suffering), and \"Anicca\" (everything changes).  Get these ideas, and you can escape the cycle of death and rebirth, called \"Sansara\".  No more sufferin', no more desire, no more anger, no more delusion, just peace.  Now, the Vinaya Pitaka, it lays out the rules for folks who follow Buddha.  Regular folks gotta follow five rules: no killin', no lyin', no stealin', no messin' around, and no gettin' drunk.  Monks, they gotta follow a whole bunch more.  But the most important thing, the whole foundation of Buddhism, is the Four Noble Truths.  First, life is suffering.  Second, why we suffer is because we cling to things.  Third, we can stop suffering.  And fourth, there's a way to stop suffering, and that's through the Eightfold Path.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya 'bout these here U.S. and Mexico fellas. They got themselves in a right ol' tussle back in the day, lasted somethin' like 57 years, from '36 to '93.  You know, like two brothers fightin' over the last piece of pie.  They even went to war over it, back in '46 and '48, the U.S. took Texas and all that southwest land from Mexico.  \n\nNow, ain't this somethin' like when your neighbors always stealin' your lawnmower or somethin'?  Countries sometimes squabble over land, resources, and beliefs, ya know?\n\nThese two, they clashed over religion, culture, tradition, and even money.  Ain't that somethin'?  Just like how folks get their noses outta joint over who got the best BBQ sauce!\n\nYou see, the U.S. and Mexico, they're like those two brothers always at it.  The U.S. had a real hankerin' for Mexico's land, kinda like that fella who always wants the biggest slice of cake.  \n\nReligion played a part too, just like when folks argue over who's got the right way to worship.  Americans back then, they weren't too keen on Catholics, kinda like how folks might not get along if one's a hunter and the other's a tree hugger.\n\nAnyway, they had all sorts of disagreements, 17 of 'em, if you believe them books.  Most of it was over land and folks crossin' the border.  It was like a big ol' border dispute, with outlaws and bandits makin' trouble.\n\nBut eventually, Mexico kinda had to rely on the U.S. for help, kinda like when your neighbor needs to borrow your tools.  And the U.S., they started lookin' at Mexico's money more than their land.  So, the fightin' died down, like when two kids finally get tired of bickerin'.",
            "Fifteen years ago, somethin' happened to me outta nowhere. This sickness, one I never even knew existed, hit me like a ton of bricks. I was a nurse back then, ya know? I went into it 'cause I wanted that safety and security, somethin' I never had growin' up. Everyone was always sayin', \"You'll always have a job, folks get sick all the time!\" So, even though I dreamed of bein' a scientist or maybe a journalist, somethin' like that, I stuck with nursing.  \n\nBut there I was, 46 years old, single, nothin' saved up, and couldn't work no more.  This sickness, it took everything from me. Fifteen years on disability now, and I'm nothin' but broke.  Every day's a fight, a struggle just to keep my head above water. My security, my safety, my pride, gone. Ain't nothin' for sure anymore, but one thing I know for sure: I couldn't have made it this far without my family and a few good friends. Believe me,  when disaster strikes, you feel mighty weak.\n\nLife throws curveballs, big and small. You can plan all you want, but some things are just too much to handle alone.\n\nI agree, we gotta stop relyin' on the government for everything. That whole system's rotten to the core.  But instead of everyone buildin' their own little fortresses, how about we start trustin' each other again? Help each other out, ask for help when we need it. That's what this country was built on: compassion, respect, and lookin' out for one another.\n\nSure, they talk about rugged individualism, but the truth is,  our forefathers didn't make it through tough times by themselves. It was by lookin' out for each other.\n\nSo yeah, be prepared. I am. Got my disaster kit, first aid, water purifiers, even plastic to cover the windows if things get real ugly. Flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, and enough canned goods to feed a small army. If you got the land, grow your own food, learn to can it. That's a good idea, just like a wood stove, as long as you ain't livin' in an apartment.\n\nBut here's the thing: get to know your neighbors.",
            "Listen up, folks! You ever wonder why critters are the way they are? Like, what makes 'em evolve into these crazy shapes? Well, some brainiacs back in the day, way back in 1917, said figuring out how life changes in math terms is like trying to herd cats! And guess what? They weren't too far off.  \n\nBut, some folks are tryin' somethin' new. They're usin' math to figure out how critters like these fancy snails, called Prunum, grow their shells. It's like, they take pictures of these shells, break 'em down into numbers, and then use computer programs to see what kinda crazy shell shapes they could come up with. \n\nThink of it like this: a shell's like a spiral staircase, goin' round and round.  Each step is a whorl, and the whole thing's built around a central pole, like the support in the middle. Now, these steps can grow bigger or smaller, and there are lines between 'em called sutures.  \n\nNow, imagine makin' a blueprint for this shell staircase. You gotta figure out how big each step is, how far apart they are, and how they all fit together. That's what these scientists are doin'! They're tryin' to figure out the rules of how these shells grow, and maybe even predict what kinda new shell shapes could pop up. It's like a puzzle, but with real live critters!",
            "Well, lemme tell ya, little ol' Indonesia ain't doin' too hot when it comes to keepin' babies alive. They been havin' the same old problems for the last ten years, nothin' much changin'.  \n\nSure, they doin' alright with clean water and bathrooms, hittin' all those fancy goals they got. But when it comes to makin' sure moms and babies are healthy, they fallin' way behind.  They ain't gonna make their goals by 2015 if they keep up like this.  \n\nWhy? Well, lemme break it down for ya.  They tryin' to say they got more midwives helpin' out with babies, 72% of 'em now.  But, a lot of these midwives are just regular folks, not real doctors.  They can't handle nothin' fancy, gotta get a real doctor if somethin' goes wrong. And that's why so many moms bleed to death after havin' babies.  \n\nThey also sayin' less babies are gettin' sick with diarrhea.  Maybe, maybe not.  They don't even know how many babies are gettin' checked after they born, so hard to say for sure.  But it ain't lookin' good.  \n\nNow, they doin' barely any C-sections, just 4%.  That's low, y'know?  In the cities, they doin' 7%, but out in the country, it's only 2%.  Seein' as how everybody goes to the city for fancy stuff, that's a problem.  Rich folks gettin' the good stuff, poor folks stuck with nothin'. \n\nThey got a whole lotta problems to solve, but the big question is:  Should they just keep doin' the same old thing, or should they fix the whole system?  Program-specific stuff is easier, quicker, and more focused.  But it can drain resources from other parts of the health system. \n\nThey need to decide what's gonna work best, and fast.  Babies ain't gettin' any younger!",
            "Victorian books are all about the little details and the fancy people who lived back then.  But there are two books, *Oliver Twist* and *Wuthering Heights*, that are kinda different. They have mystery and weird stuff going on, which wasn't really common in those books. This mystery stuff helps us understand the characters better, like what makes them tick and what they're really feelin'.\n\nHere's a bit from *Oliver Twist*:\n\n\"Suddenly, his head was full of all these confusing thoughts. He felt like he was walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were yelling at each other. He could almost hear them talking. Then he realized he was talking to them... But then BANG! Gunshots! He heard people yelling and saw flashes of light, and someone grabbed him and dragged him away. Through all this chaos, he kept feeling this weird pain that just wouldn't go away.\"\n\nThese books use mystery a lot, sometimes through dreams or things that feel like dreams. In *Oliver Twist*, these strange happenings show us what's going on inside Oliver's head, his hurts, and how he sees the world around him.  When he gets shot, it's like he's reliving it all over again in a dream, even though he's trying to find help. This part shows how out of control he is, how bad he's hurt, and those visions of Sikes and Crackit just make it worse.  He gets so overwhelmed that he doesn't even notice who's carrying him away. He's numb to everything except the pain, which is constant and scary now, not just a shock. It makes you wonder who's really in charge of his life, because it sure ain't him! This shooting shows that Oliver has zero control over anything. Even when he's in danger, he can't even try to fight back. It's like Fagin has broken him, making him give up hope. Otherwise, you'd think he'd at least try to save himself.\n\n\n*Wuthering Heights* also has mystery and dreams, but they work a little differently. *",
            "A couple years back, I was workin' in this after-school program, helpin' out the little rugrats with their schoolwork.  I was pretty good at English and readin', so that's what I mostly did. One day, this little fella named Adrian - think he was in third or fourth grade -  needed some extra help. Now, this kid was speakin' perfect English, but his readin' was all messed up.  Some letters, he'd read 'em fine, others, well, he sounded like a frog tryin' to sing opera!  It was mighty strange. I figured maybe he was just slow, but something didn't add up.   \n\nThen one day, while I was lookin' after a few stragglers, Adrian's momma walked in. Couldn't say a lick of English, just Spanish.  I was just learnin' a few words myself, but we managed to piece together what was goin' on. Turns out, Adrian knew how to read, just not the English alphabet real well.   \n\nI guess that's why he was havin' such a hard time.  It was like he knew the words, but didn't know how to put 'em together right.\n\nThat's when it hit me, see?  It ain't always as simple as it looks.  Even if a kid speaks English, readin' it can be a real struggle.  \n\nThat's why I'm sayin' we gotta do somethin' about the language barrier in schools, especially here in California.  Adrian's story shows us that it ain't always about the kid not knowin' the language, sometimes it's about knowin' the alphabet and how to put the letters together.\n\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' it's easy.  We gotta figure out what works best for each kid.  Dual language programs,  immersion, private tutors, ESL classes - all got their place, but there ain't no one-size-fits-all solution.  \n\nThe best thing to do is combine 'em all.",
            "Y'all ever think about what's bigger than us, you know? Like, somethin' we can't even wrap our heads around? Some folks go to church, others hit the temple, some try to figure it out on their own.  Lotta folks just go with what their parents taught 'em, but some, they say \"Nah, there ain't nothin' out there but what we can see.\" They live their lives in their own little world.\n\nMe, I've changed my mind about things a time or two, you know? What I thought was important one day, ain't so important the next. We all gotta figure out our own way, our own beliefs. We're all lookin' for somethin' to guide us, somethin' to make sense of it all.\n\nMy old man, he loved cardinals. We were sittin' on the porch one day, rain comin' down like crazy.  He was lookin' out at the storm, kinda like he was lost in thought. He wasn't lookin' so good, skinnier than usual, hair all thin. He didn't meet my eyes much that day. I felt kinda scared, you know? I wanted to tell him I loved him, but talkin' about it just seemed to make it all too real. So I just hugged him, sat next to him, and watched the rain.\n\nHe passed away a few months later, right before my 22nd birthday. They tried to help him with medicine and all that, but it didn't really work. He just suffered longer. God, what kind of God lets that happen, I thought. I didn't say no prayers, not that night.  If God was out there, he'd stopped listenin' to me a long time ago.\n\nI didn't want to watch him die. It was too hard. I wanted to remember him like he was, not like he was in pain. I knew him better than anyone else, better than his family did. I knew he wouldn't want me there. I just curled up in bed for a few days and waited for the news.\n\nNobody even called me.",
            "Alright, so this here \"Gothic Novel\" thing, it's like a real head-scratcher. You got folks sayin' it ain't got no depth, then you got others swearin' it's got this whole \"terrible sublime\" thing goin' on.  It's like a mix of old and new, kinda like my runnin' mate ideas, ya know?\n\nThis fella, Ian Watt, he wrote somethin' called \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel,\" and he says it's all a big ol' oxymoron 'cause it's both old and new.  He's talkin' 'bout how the first Gothic Novel, this \"Castle of Otranto\" by Horace Walpole, it took bits and pieces from old-timey romances and mixed 'em with this newfangled story-tellin' thing called the novel. Walpole, he called it a \"Gothic Story,\" and he used all sorts of theatrics and nature stuff to make it somethin' special. \n\nSee, back in the day, folks were usin' the word \"gothic\" for all sorts of things, like different people, styles, and even times. It was kinda like sayin' somethin' was old-fashioned or, well, kinda dumb compared to the \"modern\" stuff. But then you got this whole new way of tellin' stories, the novel, where the reader gets right up close and personal with the characters' thoughts and feelings.  And that's what made Gothic somethin' special, somethin' that could be both old and new at the same time.\n\nOne of the big things in Gothic Novels is this idea of \"Chivalry.\" You got these knights, brave and honorable, and the writers, well, they kinda miss that in folks these days.  Walpole, he was writin' during a time when things were pretty messed up politically, and he was scared about what the future held. Maybe he thought those \"good old days\" of chivalry had disappeared, and he wanted to bring 'em back.  In his book, you can see this in characters like Frederic. He's described as this prince who's been through a lot, suffered some tragedies, and is supposed to be dead. He's got all these chivalric traits, like a knight in shining armor. But, ya know, it's all kinda over-the-top, which kinda sets the stage for the whole Gothic thing, with all its drama and excitement.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya 'bout this 'supply chain' thing. It's like how ya get your stuff from wantin' it to havin' it in your hands.  It starts with a fella orderin' somethin', then it goes through all these steps: gettin' the stuff to make it, makin' it, stowin' it,  deciding where to keep it, gettin' it to the store, and finally, deliverin' it to ya!  This Keith Oliver fella, a smart guy, kinda made up the name 'supply chain management' back in '82. He said it's all about plannin', doin', and controllin' all those steps to make sure folks get what they want, quick and easy.\n\nNow, there are six big parts to this whole shebang: makin' it, gettin' the stuff, keepin' track of it, decidin' where to put it, movin' it around, and knowin' what's goin' on all the time.  Smart business folks use these six things to make sure their customers are happy.\n\nMakin' it's the first step. You gotta figure out when, where, and how to make the stuff.  Gotta know what folks want, right?  Look at the market, see what folks are buyin'. That tells ya what to make and how much. Then you gotta pick the right place to make it, one that can make it good and plenty, and keep the customers happy.  \n\nAfter that, it's all about plannin' when to do what and keepin' the makin' stuff in tip-top shape.  Makin' things right is real important, 'cause if you mess it up, it costs ya time and money in the long run.  I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target, and they had rules for everything, from how the workers dressed to how they got stuff off the trucks.  Keepin' things organized makes things run smooth.\n\nThe next big part is gettin' the stuff. That means figuring out where to get the stuff you need and who to trust to make it for ya.  Sometimes, you might have different parts of makin' somethin' in different places.  You gotta pick the best place for each part.  And sometimes, you gotta get help from other companies, 'cause they're good at somethin' ya ain't.  That's called \"outsorin',\" and it can make things faster and cheaper, but ya gotta make sure they do a good job.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya somethin'. This here Ellen Page gal, she's out on the street with a sign sayin' Hitler's still alive in Burma. Now, Burma, that's that Southeast Asian country where them folks been havin' a real rough go of it. They got this military junta runnin' the show, and they ain't exactly known for their kindness. Back in 2007, they had these big protests, them monks all wearin' their saffron robes, callin' it the \"Saffron Revolution.\" The government tried to shut 'em down, started gettin' rough, even attacked the monasteries.  They threw journalists in jail and even killed one, just for bein' there, a fella named Kenji Nagai. \n\nNow, this ain't nothin' new, see.  Governments always tryin' to keep folks quiet, keepin' all the power to themselves.  Back in Roman times, them emperors thought they were gods, rule everything.  Even them Japanese emperors, they think they're gods too, sent down to lead folks with cell phones and, well, that hara-kiri business. And don't even get me started on our own President, Bush.  He and that Ted Haggard fella, head of Stupid People Worldwide, they're always talkin' on the phone.  \n\nYou see, it's happened before, all over the world.  Like back in '89, them folks in Tiananmen Square, tryin' to protest the Chinese government, and the government just went and cracked down on 'em, killed a whole bunch of 'em.  And then there was that Rwandan genocide, Hutu folks killin' Tutsis, just because.  And let's not forget Hitler and the Holocaust, rounded up all them Jews and...well, you know.",

Now, he wasn't always playin' the piano loud and flashy, but when he wrote music, man, it was somethin' else! He made tunes so fancy and complicated, they let each guy in the band show off their own style.  Ellington was like the ringmaster, settin' up the whole show so these guys could go wild and improvise.  But he also knew how to make sure everything fit together, like a well-oiled machine, makin' each note sound just right.  He knew how to make each instrument sing, and how to get them all workin' together like a team.  That's why he wrote some of the best jazz music ever!\n\nThis guy Grove, he wrote a book about music, and he said Ellington was a real innovator.  He used his singers like instruments, not just for singin' words, but for makin' the music sound different and more interesting. One of his tunes, \"Creole Love Call,\" shows how he did that. It ain't no normal song, it's like a conversation between a voice and the instruments. The singer starts smooth and sweet, then gets rougher later on. Then you got this trumpet player, he plays kinda quiet and sad, but it's still real soulful. Then comes the clarinet, screamin' high notes, like it's tryin' to reach the sky!  And the whole band jumps in, makin' it a real party.\n\nEllington used all kinds of tricks like that in his music, makin' it sound like nothin' you've ever heard before. He knew how to make everything fit together, from the singers to the brass to the rhythm section. He was a real genius!",
            "She's always felt like somethin' was missin'. Like there was a hole in her life that just wouldn't be filled. It started back when she was about 14, just gettin' into all that teenage stuff.  And it was still there at 17, three years later. By then, she figured out she wanted someone, not some shiny new gadget or somethin'. But no boys ever really caught her eye. Some tried to, ya know, win her over, but nothin' worked. She wondered about it a lot, tryin' to figure out why she didn't feel nothin' for anyone. She thought about it for years, had all these theories, but nothin' ever really stuck. So she just kept livin', always wonderin' about what she was lookin' for.\n\nLife at home was usually pretty chill. Her folks were good folks, always calm and collected. They never fought, and even when she was pushin' back, tryin' to be independent, they never really got upset. She was the wild one in a calm family, always full of energy and fun. People liked her, she was a real sweetheart. \n\nBut today wasn't a calm day. She was walkin' around the house, tryin' to figure out what she wanted to do with herself, when she heard her mom scream from the kitchen. It was a sharp, scared sound. She rushed in, worryin' somethin' was wrong.  \"Mom! Mom, what's happenin'?\" Her mom was on the floor, holdin' her side, makin' little \"ow\" sounds.  Her daughter rushed to her side. \"Ouch... sweetie... I... need you to take me to... the hospital.\" She was talkin' in short breaths, in pain. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to pick you up.\" Her mom pointed, and her daughter, strong from all the workouts she'd been doin', scooped her up and carried her to the car. She laid her mom down in the back and drove as fast as she could.\n\nThe hospital smelled like medicine and sickness, and she was scared, but all she could think about was gettin' her mom help. She carried her in and yelled for a doctor. A bunch of worried faces gathered around, they pushed a bed over and laid her mom on it.

They found that folks who follow this diet, especially the \"aMed diet\" which is like the Med diet on steroids, are less likely to get those nasty heart problems, like heart attacks and strokes.  \n\nSee, the aMed diet is all about eatin' good stuff like fruits, nuts, and fish, and cuttin' back on the fatty meats and bad fats.  Plus, you can have a little wine with dinner, which ain't bad!\n\nDoctors have been sayin' for a while now that this Med diet is good for ya, but this study really focused on strokes and heart attacks.  They followed a bunch of nurses for like 20 years and kept track of what they ate and if they got sick.\n\nThey used these fancy questionnaires to see what everyone was eatin', and they found that the nurses who ate the most like Mediterranean folks were less likely to have a heart attack or stroke.  It's like magic!\n\nSo there ya have it, folks.  Eat your fruits and veggies, drink some wine, and you'll be lookin' good for years to come!",
            "Listen up folks, 'cause this here's a story about how our country, the good ol' USA, went belly up back in 2007.  Jobs disappeared faster than a squirrel up a tree, houses were worth less than a used tire, and even the big, fancy companies went bust. This mess ain't over yet, so let's figure out what went wrong and how to fix it, you hear? Well, it all started with some politicians playin' fast and loose with money. They pushed banks and companies to hand out loans to folks who couldn't even pay the electric bill. And meanwhile, these big shots at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, they were packin' up those risky loans like Christmas presents, sellin' 'em off to everyone and their uncle.\n\nNow, when folks couldn't keep up with their payments, the whole house of cards came tumblin' down. Banks were left with nothin' but empty pockets, and they passed the blame around faster than a hot potato. This whole thing started back in '99, when President Clinton was tryin' to stay in the White House. He wanted to look good for reelection, so he loosened up the rules on loans.  Back then, a fella named Steven Holmes, he was writin' for the New York Times, said right then and there that this was a recipe for disaster. He said it'd be just like the savings and loan crisis back in the '80s.  Well, ol' Steve was a prophet, wasn't he? \n\nThings got even worse 'cause folks were borrowin' money they didn't have, buyin' houses they couldn't afford. It was a real wild west out there. And then, the bubble burst. The price of houses went down faster than a greased piglet at a county fair. The big investment banks, they were left holding the bag, drowning in mortgage debts. Some of 'em went belly up, some had to sell themselves for peanuts, and the government had to step in and save the rest.",
            "Alright, so there's this thing called exposition, right?  It's when you gotta lay out the story's background, kinda like explainin' things to a slowpoke.  Sometimes it can be good, like when you're really hookin' 'em in, but most times, it's like watchin' paint dry.   You know, when your readers are yawnin' and wishin' they were doin' somethin' else, like countin' the cracks in the sidewalk. \n\nNow, I'm sure y'all know the sayin', \"Show, don't tell,\" but even I, ol' Dr. Merlin, trip up sometimes and get stuck in a whole mess of tellin' instead of showin'.  It's like when you're talkin' to someone and you just keep babblin' on and on about everything that ever happened, instead of just lettin' them see it for themselves. \n\nExposition is like that talkin' fella in a movie who just spills the beans about everything.  It's like, \"Hey, listen up!  Here's the whole story, from start to finish!\"  \n\nAnd trust me, nobody wants to hear that.  You gotta make 'em feel it, make 'em see it, make 'em understand what's goin' on without you just tellin' 'em every little detail. \n\nLet's say you're writin' a story about a gal who falls head over heels for this fella, they get hitched, and then BAM!  He gets whacked right in front of her.  You wouldn't want to spend two whole pages just tellin' us all that, would ya?  \n\nNo sir, you'd wanna show us how much they loved each other, how special he was to her, and how much she's gonna miss him.  You'd want us to feel the pain, to understand why she's so heartbroken.  \n\nSee, that's what exposition's all about:  makin' it real, makin' it feelin', makin' 'em care.  Don't just tell 'em the story, show 'em the story.",
            "Man, lemme tell ya 'bout these newscasts I watched outta Columbus, Ohio. First one was NBC 4 this mornin' (August 13, 2011), live and all. Biggest story they had was this fella in Ashley, Ohio, stabbed his wife somethin' fierce. Didn't say her name, but the fella's name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mugshot, looked like a real piece of work. They only gave him two minutes or so, which seemed right for a story still cookin'. All they said was he stabbed her a bunch of times and got hauled away. \n\nNext up was this young fella, Travis Buyers, 18 years old, shot up in Sharon Woods. Critically injured, poor kid. No one caught yet, SWAT team lookin' for the shooter. That story felt short, ya know? Makes me wonder if it was 'cause he was a black man, or livin' in a black neighborhood. 'Cause you know how it goes, when a white kid or grownup gets in trouble, the media goes bonkers. But when it's a minority, they barely give 'em a mention. \n\nThey did talk about a bullet hole in a Med-Flight helicopter, though.  .22 caliber, they said, from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers offerin' five grand for any tips leadin' to the shooter. \n\nThen they had a little chat 'bout the rain and thunder comin' Saturday. Said it'd be in the eighties all weekend.  Short and sweet, like they wanted ya to keep watchin'. \n\nAnd then this robbery at a UDF on Clime Road, Columbus. They went on and on about the robber bein' a black man, dark-skinned, six-foot tall, a hundred and fifty pounds. Seemed like they were really hammerin' home that he was black, ya know? \n\nLast story was about this Rene Rodriguez, some kinda drug kingpin from Texas.  Convicted of sendin' weed to Ohio.  Funny thing, they said he got sentenced to \"300\" months, instead of just twenty-five years.  Maybe they thought that sounded meaner?  Oh, and they mentioned he was Hispanic, which didn't seem too important to the story, if ya ask me.",
            "Brothers, man, they got this bond, like, nothin' can break it. You know, like when you're watchin' your own reflection, except it's your brother. It's love, pride, jealousy, even anger, all mixed up in there.  You see yourself in him, the good and the bad. And when things get tough, that's when you really see what that bond is made of, right or wrong.  But it ain't always pretty. That bond, it comes with baggage, ya know?\n\nThis story, \"The Scarlet Ibis\", it's all about that brotherly love, the good and the bad. These two guys, they're out there in this beautiful place, tryin' to do somethin' that ain't gonna work out. There's this pride, see, and it's like a fire, burnin' hot.  It starts with the older brother, he wants somethin' out of his little brother, someone to keep up with him, someone to share all the adventures. But the little brother, Doodle, he's different. He's got this heart thing, ain't gonna last long, and he can't do all the stuff the older brother wants to do.  Makes the older brother mad, makes him feel like he's been robbed. He even thinks about, well, let's just say he ain't happy with Doodle.  But then Doodle smiles at him, and it's like somethin' melts inside him.  \n\nThe story goes on, and you see that pride growin', and then, bam!  It all comes crashin' down.  They go on this last trip, and things go bad.  One brother makes it out, the other...well, you gotta read the story to see what happens. But it's all about that bond, about how love and pride can both hurt like hell.",
            "Dang, that brain of ours is somethin' else!  It's like a complicated gizmo, always thinkin' and creatin'.   Back in the day, folks thought it was like a wax tablet, then a piece of papyrus, then a book, and now they're sayin' it's like a computer.   But listen, don't go gettin' too hung up on that, 'cause these fancy comparisons only go so far. \n\nSee, all this thinkin' starts with our senses.  They take all these things we feel and hear and see and turn 'em into electrical signals.   The brain then takes those signals and messes with 'em, kinda like a recipe, makin' sense of 'em from the bottom up and the top down.\n\nLet's say you see a black box on a white background.  The bottom-up stuff, that's like lookin' at the box's edges and color and sayin', \"Hey, that's a box!\".   But the top-down stuff, that's like your brain already knowin' what a box is and sayin', \"Yep, that's a box, gotta be!\"\n\nNow, once the brain's got all that info, it's gotta decide what's important.  It's like a filter, lettin' in the good stuff and blockin' out the rest.  You see a whole bunch of grass, but your brain ain't gonna bother with every single blade.  But if someone calls your name in a crowed room, bam!  Your brain's all ears.\n\nTo keep all this goin', the brain's gotta store the info, too.   There's all kinds of memory, like short-term and long-term.   \n\nImagine you read a word.  Your brain stores it in a bunch of different ways: how it looks, how it sounds, and what it means.  Then it holds onto it for a bit, like somethin' you're workin' on right now.  And if it's important enough, it gets tucked away in long-term memory, like a file cabinet in your brain.\n\nNow, how all that stuff gets organized is a mystery.   Some folks say it's like a web, where ideas are connected like threads.   But nobody's quite figured it out yet.",
            "Alright, so this Huxley fella, he's got some beef with all this fancy technology and the way our money system keeps pushin' it.  In his book \"Brave New World,\" he paints a picture of a messed up future where folks care more about bein' part of the crowd than bein' themselves.  They're all about instant gratification, like a bunch of kids hooked on candy.  And the big boss man, the World Controller, he's like the puppeteer, makin' sure everyone's thinkin' the same way.\n\nNow, some smart folks who study stuff like money and power, they call themselves Marxists, and they see right through Huxley's story. He's talkin' about how things like sameness and makin' everything into a product, that's the problem.  It's like he's sayin' that our system is rigged, and the folks at the top are keepin' the rest of us in the dark about how it really works.\n\nThink about it like this:  the common folks in Huxley's book, they're just slaves to their wants and needs. They're pumped up on instant pleasures, buyin' and spendin' like there's no tomorrow. The World Controller, he's the one pullin' the strings, makin' sure they stay happy and dumb.  It's like a big ol' illusion, man.\n\nAnd the worst part is, nobody even notices! They're too busy chasin' their own tails to see the bigger picture. They're like sheep, followin' the leader without question.  Love, real feelin's, they're all gone, replaced by this phony, plastic happiness.  It's a real bummer, ya know?\n\nSo Huxley's story, it's a warning. He's sayin' that if we don't wake up and see what's really goin' on, we're gonna end up just like those folks in \"Brave New World\" - trapped in a world of fake happiness and empty promises.",
            "I been goin' to this here University Park for a couple years now, 'bout two and a half, maybe four and a half semesters. Now, gettin' around this campus is a real pain in the neck for most folks, includin' me. Back when I was a freshman, they stuck me in one of them East Halls dorms, way out east, past the stadium and that big ol' Bryce Jordan Center. Walkin' from that place to classes over by Willard, right in the middle of campus, could take you nearly 25 minutes, especially if the weather was bein' a real crank, which it seems to do a whole lot 'round here in State College. I was talkin' to a fella who graduated just a bit before me, and he told me that these East Halls used to be way out in the sticks, surrounded by nothin' but empty land. But now, they built all these new things - sports fields, fancy buildings like that new Creamery and the health place, and a bunch of apartments. It's gettin' harder and harder to get around with all this new buildin' goin' on.\n\nSo, what's the answer? How are we gonna fix this mess?  In my book, the answer is bicycles.  But it ain't just about havin' bikes, it's about havin' a campus that works for folks who ride 'em.\n\n\nI was talkin' to my friend the other day, and he just got back into ridin' after takin' a break for a while. He said he couldn't believe he ever stopped. \"Bikes are the only way to go,\" he said, \"It ain't cool to ride one for a while there, but it's the best way to get around.\" Bikes are good for ya, both physically and for gettin' places. A bowl of oatmeal and a little peddlin' and you can go 30 miles or more. Now, I live off campus, just as far from the center of campus as some of them dorms. Best decision I ever made this year was buyin' a bike. I got class in that Thomas building every day, and it's a good 25-minute walk from my place. But on my bike, I can make it in 5 minutes if I'm peddlin' hard. \n\nThe only problem is, that road, Pollock Road, it's the straightest way to Thomas, but it ain't always the easiest to ride.  Yeah, walkin' is good too, but I'm too busy for that. If I didn't have my bike, walkin' would be the only way to get to class.  Walkin' to Thomas every day would take another 30-40 minutes out of my day, that's over two and a half hours every week. And that's not countin' all the other walkin' I'd have to do to get to class, appointments, and all that other stuff.  Just ain't got the time for that."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs.

            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",

To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1).

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day!

            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "Man, lemme tell ya, helpin' folks, that's what gets me goin'. I wanna be workin' with kids who've had a rough go, ya know, abused and neglected.  And I wanna help families that are fallin' apart. I'm talkin' 'bout real help, the kinda that makes a difference.\n\nI believe in treatin' folks right, doin' the right thing, and always tryin' to be better.  It ain't just about social work, it's about livin' right.  See, I always wanted to help folks, but I didn't know how.  Back in school, I saw a lot of folks runnin' from their problems, doin' things that weren't right.  That's why I got my Psychology degree, figured it would help me understand.\n\nOne time, I met this young kid, just sixteen,  scared outta his wits.  His folks were treatin' him awful.  I knew I had to do somethin'. I talked to the cops, told 'em what I knew.  Turns out, the law couldn't do much, so they asked me to talk to the parents.  When I did, they were nervous, tryin' to make excuses for how they treated their own son.\n\nThat's when I knew, I gotta be a social worker. Gotta help these kids, protect 'em from folks who don't know how to treat 'em right.\n\nAnd let me tell ya, fairness matters. We say everyone's important, but we act like we all gotta be the same.  I ain't buyin' it. I'm gonna stand up for what's right, fight for the folks who can't fight for themselves.  I've always done that, standin' up against bullies, racists, anyone tryin' to push folks down.  That's my way, and it ain't gonna change.",
            "Well now, lemme tell ya 'bout this here sleep stuff.  Seems like there's two ways folks look at it: the insides of your head, and what's goin' on around ya. \n\nFirst, ya got the folks who say it's all in your genes, like inheritin' a bad back or a love for chili. They talk 'bout stuff like your brain cells and how they work, like that there orexin thingy.  They did some tests on mice, sayin' that these orexin fellas tell ya when to sleep and when to stay awake.  They found that messin' with these little fellas can make a mouse sleepy or wired.  So, if you got a messed up orexin, maybe that's why you can't sleep right.\n\nThen ya got the folks who say it's all 'bout your life, like your job, your fam, and who you hang with. They say things like where ya live, your money situation, and even what color ya are can mess with your sleep.  \n\nSo, this paper here is talkin' about both sides of this sleep story. They're lookin' at all the studies and tryin' to figure out which one makes more sense. They even talkin' 'bout different kinds of sleep problems, like when you just can't fall asleep or when you fall asleep but can't stay asleep.",
            "Alright, so this here paper's talkin' 'bout somethin' called Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD for short.  It's kinda like this, see?  Some folks, they hear just fine, but their brains, well, their brains ain't quite cuttin' it when it comes to understandin' what they hear.  Like, they can hear you talkin', but they might have trouble makin' sense of it all, or maybe they can't tell where the sounds are comin' from.  We're gonna break it down into three parts: what CAPD is, how ya tell if someone's got it, and what a teacher can do to help out a kid in the classroom that's dealin' with this.   \n\nFirst off, CAPD is like a glitch in the brain's sound center. It ain't that their ears ain't workin', it's that their brain's havin' trouble processin' all the sounds it's gettin'.  They might hear a word, but they can't quite figure out what it means, or they might hear lots of different sounds at once and not be able to tell 'em apart.   People first started talkin' 'bout this kinda thing back in the 50s, but it took a while to figure out what was goin' on.   \n\nNow, there ain't no one test that can tell ya for sure if someone's got CAPD, but there are ways to figure it out.  Doctors and teachers might use tests and watch how a kid listens and responds to sounds, seein' if they're havin' any trouble. It's kinda like when you're watchin' a kid play, you can tell if they're strugglin' with somethin' just by watchin' 'em.\n\nSo, what can a teacher do if they've got a kid in their class with CAPD? Well, that's what we're gonna talk about next.",
            "So, this play, Twelfth Night, it's sayin' somethin' about how usin' disguises, even if it works for a while, can mess ya up real bad. If you keep pretendin' to be someone you ain't, you might just lose yourself completely. The problem is, if you stop the charade, you might hurt people's feelings. See, some folks might not care if you tricked 'em, but others, they'll be real mad and think you're a phony.\n\nNow, when it comes to pretendin' to be the opposite gender, that's a whole other can of worms. It makes you wonder, why'd they even do it in the first place? Like, why ditch their own skin and try to be someone else? In Viola's case, it's about stayin' safe. She's in a new place, and she figures if she pretends to be a guy, folks won't mess with her so much. \n\nIt works, but now she's all alone, cut off from the other women. And to make things worse, she's so good at playin' the guy role that Olivia, this rich lady, falls for her! Olivia even calls her \"husband\", can you believe that? And then there's Orsino, the Duke, who's got feelings for Viola, even though she's playin' a dude. It's a whole tangled mess.\n\nBut maybe that's the point. Maybe this play is sayin' that pretendin' can help folks figure out what they really feel.  Olivia and Orsino, maybe they were hidin' some feelings they didn't even know they had. Maybe Olivia's not even really into Cesario, but she's just so used to lookin' at folks and judgin' 'em by their looks, that she falls for the act. Once she sees Sebastian, who's Viola's twin brother, she forgets all about Cesario.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya, them Germans, they weren't exactly known for bein' nice to folks when they were runnin' things. Especially in that place they called South West Africa, now Namibia. They done messed up real bad, killed a whole bunch of Ovaherero and Nama folks. Now, I ain't sayin' all the Germans were bad, mind ya. They ran things different in different places, just like folks do today. \n\nWhen them Brits took over in East Africa after the war, they found a whole lot of Africans could read and write, thanks to the Germans. Seems like they did alright in some places, like Kamerun. But down in South West Africa, it was a whole different story.\n\nThey basically left it up to those missionary folks to teach the natives, and the government didn't give 'em much help. But for the white folks, they built schools and made sure them missionaries were doin' things right.  Makes ya wonder what kinda thinking was goin' on there, huh?\n\nAnyway, long story short, most of the folks in South West Africa couldn't read or write after the Germans left. It was like they never even tried. Now, I'm not sayin' it was all the Germans' fault, but those policies they had sure didn't help.\n\nThere's a whole lotta books written about how the Germans ran things in their colonies, mostly by them Germans themselves back in the day. Then some folks from England started doin' some studies, comparin' how things were done in different places.\n\nOne fella, Cohen, he wrote a book about how things were different in South West Africa and East Africa. He said it all comes down to the fact that South West Africa had a lot more white folks livin' there. \n\nNow, South West Africa wasn't exactly a hotbed of activity, but it wasn't too bad either. There were a whole lot more white folks there than in any of the other German colonies.",
            "Listen up, folks! Music's changed a whole lot in the last hundred years. There's so many dang styles now, it's hard to keep track! You got your rock, your country, your jazz, your rap, and a whole mess of others. And get this, each one of those has a bunch of little sub-genres, like little branches on a tree.\n\nNow, Heavy Metal rock? That's a real wild one. It's been around for about 40 years and it's got all kinds of flavors. It's like a big ol' potluck, everyone bringin' their own dish. Some folks like it dark and moody, others like it loud and fast. You got your death metal, your thrash metal, your power metal, and more than I can even remember. \n\nIt's gotten so crazy that it's hard to say exactly what makes something \"heavy metal\" anymore. It's like a chameleon, changin' colors all the time to fit in with whatever's popular. But even though it's all mixed up now, it all started somewhere.\n\nYou see, Heavy Metal is more than just music. It's a whole movement, like a big ol' family. It's about bein' loud, bein' proud, and bein' different. It's about takin' what you got and makin' it your own.\n\nIt's got this dark side to it, kinda like a storm cloud.  It's got more bass, more guitars, more drums, more everything! The guys in these bands are real musicians, they know their stuff. And let's be honest, a little bit of drugs never hurt nobody, right? \n\nIt's like the Beatles, even they got in on the action with songs like \"Helter Skelter.\"  Talk about dark!",
            "Well, lemme tell ya, this fella Rousseau, he was a dreamer, sorta like those fancy Surrealists, but he was doin' it way back before they came along.  See, he painted this picture, \"The Dream,\" back in 1910, and it ain't just some gal starin' at pretty things in her sleep. It's like he's puttin' his own hopes and dreams on that canvas, ya know?\n\nThis guy, he wanted folks to think he was a real artist, to be respected by the fancy art crowd. But here's the catch: he was stuck between a rock and a hard place. He wanted to be accepted, but he also wanted to paint his own dang way.  \n\nNow, this Rousseau fella, he wasn't born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He worked for the government, collectin' tolls, and never had any fancy art lessons. He lost his wife and kids, too, which left him pretty heartbroken. So, he took up paintin' as a way to make somethin' of himself and find some peace. He wasn't tryin' to be all fancy and highbrow like some of the other artists, he just wanted to paint what he saw and felt.\n\nBut the art world, well, it can be a tough nut to crack.  He was startin' late compared to all the other artists makin' a name for themselves. He wanted to be part of that crowd, to be accepted, but he had to choose: follow the rules or stay true to himself. \"The Dream,\" that's where it all comes together, ya know? It's like a snapshot of his struggle, his desire to be recognized and his fear of losin' his own voice.",
            "A whole bunch of smart folks have said that ethics and beauty are like two sides of the same coin. I reckon they're right. Like that poet Keats said, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\"  We learn most things in life by reading books or doin' things, but we just kinda *know* when somethin's right or wrong, or when somethin's beautiful, without havin' to think too hard about it.  \n\nEthics and beauty ain't about tellin' ya what to do or what to think. It's more about tryin' to figure out *why* somethin' is beautiful or why somethin' is right. Like, when we talk about a painting bein' good, we might talk about the colors and the shapes, but that don't really explain why it makes us feel somethin'. It's like when you're asked about your favorite song, you just gotta say, \"There's just somethin' about it,\" ya know?\n\nSame goes for morals. We can talk about right and wrong all day long, but it's hard to put it into words. It's like Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way.\" There's always somethin' more to it than just the words.  \n\nI think that's what makes art and morals so powerful. They touch somethin' deep inside us that we can't always explain.  It's like when you read a good book, or see somethin' truly beautiful. It just makes ya feel somethin'. And I think that's why they're so connected.",
            "Germany today is a powerful country, united and full of its own unique culture. You can feel this culture everywhere, from Munich in the shadow of the Alps all the way to Kiel by the Baltic Sea. It's the same story from Cologne on the Rhine River, through the heart of Germany, and to Dresden, that cool Saxon city on the Elbe.  It makes sense that Germany, as we know it now, came from all sorts of different places and people.\n\nThe land we know as Germany has been home to Germans for ages. Where the name \"Germany\" came from is something folks still argue about. Some say it comes from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, back when they lived across the Rhine River and fought those Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar, way back when, first used the word \"Germanus\" in his writings about the Gallic Wars. He used it to tell the difference between the Gauls he conquered and those pesky Germanic tribes who kept crossing the Rhine (Caesar, 50-40 BC). Some think he got the word from the Gauls themselves.  Others think it comes from the spear they used in battles, called a \"ger\" (O.E.D, 2010), or maybe from an old Irish word meaning \"to shout,\" because, well, Germans were known for being loud (Names of Germany).\n\nTacitus, a Roman historian, wrote way back in 98 AD about the origins of the Germans. He said they were the original people in Germany, not mixed with anyone else (Tacitus, 98).  He thought it would be crazy for anyone to leave Asia, Africa, or even Italy to come to Germany! Who would want to live in a wild, cold place with grumpy people? (Tacitus, 98).\n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germany? Not the Romans, not at first anyway. They might send out armies to grab stuff from Germany or fight battles, but they mostly just went back home to their big empire.  As the Germanic tribes popped up around the first century, they lived right on the edge of the Roman Empire. They traded goods they took from the land and even fought for the Romans in their army (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "Man, I was lookin' at this thing, just starin' at it.  My mind was workin' but not really gettin' anywhere. I was takin' it all in, you know, like a scientist or somethin', but it wasn't clickin' for me.  Thoughts were poppin' up and disappearin' faster than a fly at a picnic. It was like my brain was on autopilot, just processin' the sights without really thinkin' about 'em. \n\nThis one time, this art fella I knew told me about this book, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\"  I always wanted to learn how to draw, ever since I was a kid, and this book promised to teach ya everything, even how your brain makes sense of lines.  One trick it had was to put a square around whatever you're lookin' at, like a frame.  So, instead of lookin' at this whole mess, you're just focusin' on that one part, like a bowl of fruit on a table.  \n\nBut lookin' at this thing, I couldn't picture that frame. I was just overwhelmed, man.  Like, Picasso had his blue period, Monet loved green, and all those fancy Italian guys painted with every color under the sun. I was tryin' to think, \"Maybe this is my thing, my art, my story.\" But all I could think was, \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nSo there I was, holdin' this thing, my hand ready to go.  My muscles were tensed up, like I was about to do somethin' important. And then I did it.  Water swirlin', clean and clear, stuff fallin' away.  My hand went for the toilet handle again, this time with more force. I swear, that brown thing was stuck like glue.  \n\nMop in one hand, lookin' like a fool in my green tie, I stared at this mess someone left behind.  A few more flushes, a few more moments of quiet contemplation, and then I reached for the toilet paper.  I wrapped it around my hand like I was mummifyin' somethin'.  \n\nI stood up straight, then bent over, my hand reaching into the bowl, like I was checkin' on a turkey in the oven...",

The big brains at the National Institutes of Health say those teen brains ain't even ready for the danger of drivin', just plain greenhorns, that's all.  And that lack of experience, well, it's a recipe for disaster. More crashes, more rollovers, even more speedin' and drivin' off the road, ya hear?\n\nNow, ain't nothin' worse than those teenagers cruisin' around with their buddies, and we all know they do it all the time.  Some fancy-pants group in California did a study, showed it plain as day – the more buddies in the car, the more trouble they get into.\n\nSo California and some other states, they're tryin' to help out, givin' these young'uns temporary licenses, limitin' their hours and who they can have in the car.  But that's like puttin' a bandage on a bullet wound, ya know?\n\nThe real problem is, these kids just ain't ready to handle the car, plain and simple. Some smart fella, Marvin Zuckerman, he says 18 ain't even old enough! He's done some studies, shows that young folks just love to take risks, get that thrill, ya get me?  So maybe we should wait a bit longer, let 'em grow up some, before they're behind the wheel.\n\nWe keep lettin' 'em drive, it's gonna be a bloodbath out there! All those baby boomers' kids, they'll be drivin' soon, and it'll be chaos!  We need new laws, somethin' to keep these kids safe. Schools can teach 'em about drivin', but no one under 18 gets behind the wheel, plain and simple.  Then maybe a temporary permit, and some practice with a grown-up.\n\nLook, it ain't rocket science, folks! We gotta do somethin' before more kids end up in the graveyard. National laws, that's what it takes.  We can save lives, I tell ya!",
            "So I was lookin' through these old Edison movies, see, the ones from way back when, and I found a bunch of these trick films.  There were fifteen of 'em, made between 1895 and 1901.  These movies, they ain't your regular stuff, they use some fancy editing tricks to make ya think things are happenin' that ain't.\n\nI spent a good amount of time lookin' at these flicks, tryin' to figure out how they worked their magic.  Most of 'em, they stick to the same old ways, ya know? They're shot in one spot, like they're on a stage, and the camera just sits there, no movin' around.  They use long shots and medium shots, never gettin' close up on nothin'.  And each movie, well, it's like one big idea, one shot, boom, it's over.\n\nBut then there's a few of these later ones, they start doin' somethin' different, like usin' more than one shot in a movie. It's like they're tryin' something new.\n\nOne thing that's real common in these trick films is that they're all shot inside, like they're on a stage.  The camera just sits there, watchin' the action go on, never movin'. Kinda like how they used to do it in vaudeville shows.  So the folks in the movies, they just walk back and forth, never comin' closer or goin' further away from the camera.\n\nAnd because they're all shot in one spot, they use long shots and sometimes medium shots, but never nothin' close up. That's 'cause they wanted folks to see the whole thing, just like at a play.\n\nAnd these movies, they're real short, just a minute or less, 'cause each one is like one big idea. They're mostly just a bunch of little tricks, like makin' somethin' disappear or reappear, kinda like magic.\n\nNow, here's the thing, sometimes what looks like one shot in the movie, it might actually be a bunch of shots put together to make the trick work.  Take this one movie, \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots,\" for instance. It looks like it's all one shot, but if you look real close, you can see where they cut between shots to make it look like her head's been cut off.",
            "This John Taylor fella, he was all about bein' a good ol' Republican, ya know?  He was a farmer, through and through, but even him talkin' politics, he was a straight shooter, always speakin' his mind about freedom and how the government should run. See, he thought farm life was the best, and that's what shaped his whole view on everything. He wanted to keep things simple, protect the farmers, and that's what drove his ideas about the government, the Constitution, even the courts.\n\nJohn believed America had a real shot at buildin' somethin' special, somethin' better than what Europe had.  Since we didn't have all that old-world baggage, we could start fresh, build a system where folks could govern themselves. He was all about folks havin' rights, natural rights, that's what he called 'em, and he said if one right gets messed with, they all start fallin' apart. Government shouldn't be messin' with those rights none. He said back in the \"wild west,\" the strong guys always took what they wanted, but in a civilized society, that ain't right.\n\nTo make this perfect society, John thought we needed a government that understood both the good and bad in people. He was a firm believer in good and evil, that folks are born with 'em both. He said, \"Government's run by people, so it's gonna have all the good and bad that people have.\"  He thought good government protected your stuff, helped farmers, and kept people from gettin' too greedy.  He believed even if a government was run by scoundrels, it'd still work if it was built on those good principles.\n\nHe thought folks are naturally selfish, but that's not always bad. It's only bad when folks get greedy and try to take advantage of others.  A good government keeps folks in line, but we gotta watch it close so it don't start doin' bad things itself.\n\nJohn, like a lot of his Republican friends, wanted a government that stuck to the Constitution. He wanted it small and simple, just doin' what the Constitution said, nothin' more. He knew a big government cost a lot of money and could easily turn into a tyrant. But he said just readin' the words ain't enough, gotta understand what the fellas who wrote it meant. He thought the Declaration of Independence was more important, 'cause it said America was a bunch of states, each lookin' out for themselves, not one big country.",
            "Alright, so listen up, we had this project, see, and it was about gettin' folks to ditch their cars and  walk or bike to work.  Figure 17, that there chart, shows things went south around the third month. Kinda bummed us out, to be honest.  \n\nNow, it's New England, so winter hit hard, right?  Folks ain't walkin' or bikin' much when it's snowin' or freezin'. December, that's when the semester ends, everyone's swamped with schoolwork and whatnot.  Fillin' out a log for the project?  Yeah, that probably slipped their minds.  Then December's when the holidays hit, and everyone's scatterin' for the hills.  Students and teachers gone, ain't nobody on campus for a whole month.  Come January, things start up again, but by then, the log entries are still low.  \n\nNow, I reckon any project starts with a bang, folks all excited, then it fades a little.   To try and keep things goin', we had this \"Carpool Challenge Week\" in March, like a big ol' push to get folks back on track.  Worked, too, entries went up.  But heck, keepin' things movin' when folks are busy or on break? That's a challenge right there.\n\nAnother thing is, folks love their cars.  It's part of our culture.  Gotta give 'em somethin' to make 'em wanna ditch the wheels.  We gave out gift cards, you know, to restaurants, coffee shops, even massage places.  But I wonder if somethin' bigger woulda worked, like a shiny new bike, a hybrid car, or maybe even a fancy electric one.  \n\nThe prizes stayed the same the whole time.  Maybe if we'd upped the ante, like sayin', \"Hey, in December, we're givin' away bikes!\" and then, in January, \"And in January, it's a hybrid car!\"  Maybe that'd have kept folks interested.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya 'bout these fancy things called ETFs, they're like index funds but fancier, kinda like a stock but traded on the market. You know how index funds track somethin' like the whole market, but ETFs are more like pickin' a few stocks to follow.  And here's the deal, they're cheaper than those mutual funds, but ya gotta pay a little somethin' somethin' each time ya buy or sell 'em, just like regular stocks.  The good thing about ETFs is there's a whole bunch of 'em out there, so ya can find one for just about anything.  Now, some folks say ETFs give ya all the good stuff of a fund, like spreadin' your money around, but ya gotta look close and make sure they ain't just talkin' a big game.  \n\nNow lemme tell ya 'bout this one ETF, IHF, I'm gonna compare it to the top ten stocks it's made up of. I'm gonna see if just buyin' those ten stocks straight up is better than buyin' the whole ETF.  \n\nSee, these ten stocks make up most of what's in the ETF, like 63% or somethin'.  So we're gonna see if they act like the whole ETF, like if they make the same kinda money or have the same kinda risk.  I'm gonna figure out somethin' called \"Beta,\" which tells ya how risky somethin' is, and \"return,\" which is how much money ya make.\n\nWell, turns out, the ten stocks made a little more money than the whole ETF, like 6% more. And they were a little less risky too.  So it looks like buyin' those ten stocks straight up might be a better deal. But I gotta make sure it ain't just luck, ya know?\n\nSo I'm gonna check somethin' called \"standard deviation,\" which tells ya how much the price of somethin' goes up and down. If the ten stocks are less risky than the ETF, then maybe buyin' just those ten stocks is the way to go.",
            "Alright, so Poe, he thought \"Dream-Land\" was one of his best poems, ya know? Now, in this poem, he uses this word \"Thulé\", like a fancy name for a place.  Turns out, some smart guy named Mabbott figured out that Poe got this word from an old fella named Virgil. Virgil wrote about this island called Thulé way up north, past Britain, where folks back then thought the world ended.  Now, Virgil definitely used the word, but there's this other guy, Goethe, who Poe really liked.  Poe was a big fan of German writers. \n\nThis whole thing about Thulé is important 'cause it shows Poe knew his stuff, ya know? This guy, Arndt, wrote a book comparing Poe's poem to Goethe's, and he thinks Poe was basically copying him.  \n\nGoethe was a big deal back then. This book of his called \"Faust\" was super famous, with two parts, one in 1808 and the other when he died, 1832.  There's this little poem in the second part of \"Faust\" called \"The King of Thulé.\" It's about this king who loses his wife, and after she dies, he just drinks and cries all the time.  He's so sad he decides to die too, and he gives away everything except this fancy goblet his wife gave him. He goes to a cliff, throws the goblet in the ocean, closes his eyes, and that's it.\n\nNow, the King of Thulé, he's kinda like Poe's character in \"Dream-Land,\" maybe a dark reflection of Poe's own sadness and drinking problems.  \"Faust\" was even made into a play in 1842, just before Poe used the word \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"  \n\nPoe only uses \"Thulé\" a couple of times in his writing. Once in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and twice in \"Dream-Land\" at the beginning and end of the poem.  You could almost read them together, like they're friends. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker talks about this dark, lonely place called Thulé, haunted by dead friends, and everything's just gray and sad.  It's like he's stepped right into the King of Thulé's story.\n\nGoethe was a big shot, and Poe would've known him, even if it was just 'cause Poe liked Tennyson. Plus, everyone was copying Goethe back then.",
            "So, some lady named Jennifer Palmer went and slipped on some applesauce in a grocery store, hurt her back real bad.  Now she's trying to sue the store, sayin' the manager knew about the spill and didn't clean it up for half an hour 'cause he was busy eatin' dinner. She wants the store to pay her extra money, kinda like a punishment, 'cause she says the manager was bein' a real jerk. \n\nSee, in California, ya gotta prove the store manager did somethin' real bad on purpose, like he meant to hurt her or was just plain nasty.  The lady's sayin' he knew folks were slipin' and fallin' on spills all the time, but still didn't care. That's a pretty good argument, maybe even mean enough to get her extra money.\n\nIt all happened back in 2009.  Two employees told the manager, Paul, about the spilled applesauce. He just told 'em to go away 'cause he was eatin'.  Then, half an hour later, Jennifer goes and slips, hurts herself somethin' fierce.\n\nThe lady's lawyer is sayin' this ain't just a simple accident, it's like the manager was willfully ignorin' the danger, like he didn't care if someone got hurt. That's what they mean by \"despicable\" I guess.\n\nSo now the judge's gotta decide if the manager was really that bad, bad enough to pay extra money.  That's a tough one, huh?",
            "Y'all know, back when I took that Islam class at CBC, like four years ago, we talked a lot about whether Islam was a mean religion or not. Seems even more important now, don't ya think? After 9/11, the media went from really hating on Muslims and folks like that to bein' all soft on 'em. Like, could you imagine back in 2001 havin' a president named Barack Obama, with his Muslim family history? No way!\n\nNow, this book about Muhammad, it's got me confused. See, I always thought he was a real tough guy, conquerin' tribes and makin' 'em turn Muslim. But this book paints him as a martyr, misunderstood and humble. People just came to him, seein' the truth in his words.  It's like they're tryin' to make him out to be some kinda saint.\n\nAnd get this - there are some things about Muhammad's story that sound a lot like stuff Jesus did. Like, he turned milk and meat into enough for forty guys! It makes me wonder if they're tryin' to steal Jesus' thunder, y'know? They're downplayin' Jesus' miracles to make Muhammad look bigger.\n\nThe book also tells a lot of stories about folks convertin' to Islam on their own, but it's all hearsay. They say \"So-and-so told me, who heard it from so-and-so.\" Makes it sound fishy to me.\n\nWhat really bothers me is how they try to make Muhammad seem so perfect, humble, and wise. But history ain't got nothin' on that, no sir. I just can't believe Muslims today know the whole story about how Muhammad got so powerful.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya, it seems like them fancy theologians done went and changed up Jesus's teachings somethin' fierce since he kicked the bucket. Kinda like how my buddy took my pool plans and made 'em his own, but didn't ask first.\n\nLook, the world's gettin' more open-minded every day, like a rusty gate finally swingin' open. Now, some folks are stuck in their ways, like a mule in a ditch, but they ain't gonna change the whole darn world. More and more folks are gonna start lookin' back and seein' what got added to Christianity over the years, stuff that wasn't even in Jesus's playbook.\n\nIt might take a while, maybe decades or even longer, but mark my words, things are gonna change. It'll be like rewindin' a VCR, goin' back to the basics, back to Jesus's original message. Imagine folks gettin' rid of all that extra stuff, layer by layer, until all that's left is Jesus himself, plain and simple.\n\nThis change is gonna sweep through America and Europe faster than a wildfire, and folks are gonna start worshipin' like it's the good ol' days back when Jesus walked the earth. The church, well, they'll be leadin' the way, but things are gonna be different.\n\nAll these different churches, all these different ideas, it's gonna start to fade away. It'll be more like one big family again, everybody singin' from the same hymn book.\n\nHistory's full of these big changes, like when the Romans went from persecutin' Christians to becomein' Christians themselves. Or how America went from slavery to havin' Black folks leadin' the way.\n\nThis time, it's gonna be about Christianity, goin' back to its roots, gettin' rid of all the fancy stuff, and comin' together as one.\n\nAnd here's the secret sauce: folks are gonna start seein' Jesus's words differently, not just as plain words, but like stories and symbols.\n\nNow, let's talk about where it all started.\n\nWay back in the day, before Jesus came along, there was Judaism. It was all about one God, God's word, and the Hebrew scriptures.\n\nThe Jewish folks weren't all on the same page, though. They had their own groups, like the Sadducees, the Pharisees, the Essenes, and the Zealots.",
            "Listen,  this book, \"The Jungle\", it shows us how folks, deep down, they're just plain greedy.  It's all about lookin' out for number one, ya know? They don't give a hoot about anyone else, especially if they're not makin' them rich.  \n\nYou see it right there in the bosses of these big factories. They just wanna make their companies bigger and bigger, no matter who gets hurt along the way.  They don't care about the smoke pourin' outta their chimneys, or the stinkin' mess from all the animals around the place.  It's all about the money, see?  Like that author, Sinclair, he says, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". That's how bad it was, man. \n\nAnd the bosses, they don't care about their workers neither. They'll work 'em 'til they drop, then fire 'em without a second thought.  Back then, there weren't no rules protectin' folks, so the bosses could do whatever they wanted. It was a real dog-eat-dog world in that Packingtown. \n\nThe workers were treated worse'n dogs, like slaves.  They were workin' themselves to death, but nobody helped 'em. Even the unions were just lookin' out for themselves. They were makin' money off the backs of the poor folks. \n\nIt's a real sad story, man. Just shows how greed can corrupt people, and how the powerful can take advantage of the weak.",
            "Some writers, they got tricks for makin' ya feel somethin' 'bout what they're writin', ya know? Some ways work better'n others. F. Scott Fitzgerald, he's one smart fella, he uses all kinds of tricks in his book, \"The Great Gatsby\". Sometimes he'll put words together that don't usually go together, like a \"blue banana\", just to make ya feel somethin' different about somethin'. Other times, he'll pick a color or somethin', give it a meaning, and then use that same color to make ya feel that same way 'bout somethin' important. He does that with colors all the time, like gold, green, white, gray, and even red and pink. \n\nIn \"The Great Gatsby\", he builds up meanings for these colors, especially white and gray, and then uses 'em to make ya remember somethin' 'bout somethin' important. He uses white and gray to mean, well, kinda like boring sameness, like everything's the same. White's a bit fancier, and gray's more like old and worn out. He starts doin' this right at the beginning of the book. Daisy and Jordan are always wearin' white, like all the time! Nick wears white pants to Gatsby's party, Tom's wearin' a white shirt when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine's all pale and white.  The only time folks ain't wearin' white is when Nick's gettin' a feel for Gatsby's party, and then it's all bright colors, like nothin' like white. He uses these colors to describe all sorts of things, too, like Nick goin' to work down these white streets, or  names at Gatsby's party lookin' gray on Nick's list. Catherine's apartment, it's like a big white cake, all the same. He even uses white and gray for folks and places that ain't nothin' special, like Jordan and Daisy's childhood, the cars and the land in the valley of ashes, even a little kid and an old dog seller.\n\nAfter he's used white and gray enough, he starts usin' 'em to show that somethin' ain't important or that it's just the same as everything else. He does this with Daisy first. After he don't use white or gray for a while, he starts describin' Daisy wearin' white in a white car. Now, we start seein' Daisy as less of a real person and more like somethin' Gatsby just wants, somethin' plain and boring. He keeps doin' this with Daisy, like describin' her fur collar as a gray haze. It's all about makin' ya feel somethin' about Daisy, somethin' kinda flat and empty.",
            "San Diego's weather is perfect for growin' crops, y'all.  They got tomatoes, citrus, greens, squash, broccoli, all sorts of herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, even peppers. Folks in San Diego are real keen on eatin' organic, and there's a whole lotta demand for it. They got these farms that sell their food straight to folks, kinda like a club, and they're always got waitin' lists.  Organic eggs and milk are real popular too. Now, a lot of these organic farms, they're not just about the food. They let folks come out and see how they do things, even go for a hike or watch the birds.  It's a way for the farmers to make some extra dough, teach folks somethin', and it's good for the land. \n\n\nNow, organic farmin' ain't easy. It takes a whole lot more work, 'cause you can't just use all those chemicals to get rid of pests and weeds. And sometimes, you lose more crops than if you were usin' that stuff. Plus, a little farm like that can't compete with the big boys when it comes to makin' a profit.\n\nBut there's a whole lotta good things about it too. The land's healthier, you got more critters around, and that makes for a prettier place to live. So, if you're a farmer thinkin' about doin' things the organic way, there's some help out there. The government's got programs to help folks who wanna do right by the land and still make a livin'.\n\nTake this piece of land I found, right next to Potrero. It's got chaparral, some grass that ain't from around here, and some oak trees. It's right next to the forest, and there's all sorts of critters livin' there, some of 'em rare as hen's teeth. This land's been around for a long time, first the Native Americans lived there, then some folks came along and raised cattle and cut wood.\n\nNow, I found this organic farm not far away, and they're doin' things the right way. It gives you an idea of what could be done with that piece of land.",
            "Well, let me tell ya, culture is a big ol' deal when you're tryin' to get somethin' done. It ain't just about what a culture *is*, it's about what it ain't too. You can't just say \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese folks are nice as pie\" 'cause that ain't right.  Every culture's got its own way of doin' things, its own quirks and beliefs.  \n\nWhen you're dealin' with folks from a different place, you gotta remember that you're lookin' at it through your own lens. It's kinda like lookin' at a picture through a funhouse mirror, ya know? You can see the shapes, but they ain't quite right.\n\nSo instead of tryin' to change 'em or judge 'em, just gotta accept 'em for who they are and play along. Especially when you're the one who's got less to bargain with. It's like showin' respect when you're in someone else's house, ya gotta treat their stuff with care.\n\nNow, culture ain't just about countries, it's about companies too. Some companies are all about long hours and hard work, others are more laid back. You can tell a lot about a company by how folks dress, how they talk to each other, and who they hire. Some companies even encourage their employees to give back to the community, others are more focused on the bottom line.\n\nBut here's the kicker: even within a country, you'll find different cultures. Like back home in America, we got all sorts of different kinds of companies, from big corporations to small businesses, and each one's got its own way of doin' things.\n\nAnd then there's values. Those are the real heart of a culture, the reasons behind the actions. If a culture values respect and harmony, they ain't gonna embarrass their boss to get ahead. But a culture that values a hard bargain might hold out longer.\n\nSo, before you go in to negotiate with someone, it's good to do a little homework on their culture. But don't forget to get to know the person you're talkin' to too. That'll help you make a real connection and get somethin' done.",
            "So, these two fellas, Anselm and Aquinas, they both wanted to prove God exists, see? But they went about it different ways. Anselm, he's all about faith, like lookin' inside yourself and knowin'. He says, since we can even think about God, He's gotta be real, like, it's in our heads already.  He's sayin' you don't need no fancy proof, just trust what you know in your heart. \n\nNow, Aquinas, he's the kinda guy who wants facts, you know? He thinks you can prove God with your brain, like a puzzle. He lays out five reasons why God has to be there, like how things change, where stuff comes from, and how everything ain't just happenin' by itself. He's sayin' it all adds up to God bein' the missing piece. \n\nBoth of 'em got good points, but neither one's got the whole picture, ya know? It's like, Anselm's sayin' trust your gut, and Aquinas is sayin' use your noggin. But neither one's gonna convince everyone.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya 'bout this fella, Buddha, back in the ol' days, like way back when folks were just starting to figure things out.  He was some kinda prince, but he got tired of all that fancy livin'.  So, he said \"screw this\" and went off to find the truth. Turns out, he found it, became all wise and stuff, and started preachin'.  People listened, liked what he had to say, and bam!  Buddhism was born. Now, this one branch of Buddhism, called Theravada, is like the original recipe, been around for over 2,500 years.  But times change, right?  Even Buddha wouldn't recognize it today.  Like, in Sri Lanka, they do this water-cuttin' thingy every year.  Monks and regular folks, all chip in, and it's kinda important, even though Buddha never mentioned nothin' about it.  See, Buddhism ain't just about the big ideas, it's about the little stuff too, and it's changed over the years.  Both the monks and the regular folks who follow Buddha, they had to tweak their beliefs a bit.  Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad, sometimes it's just life, ya know?  We'll get into all the details, but first, let's talk about the basics.\n\nBuddhists, they believe in three things: the Buddha himself, his teachings (called \"Dhamma\"), and the community of followers (called \"Sangha\").  Think of it like a three-legged stool, all gotta be there.  The \"Dhamma\" is like the rulebook, all written down in these ancient texts called the Tripitaka.  There's the Sutta Pitaka, which is like the main preachin's, the Vinaya Pitaka, which is the monk's code of conduct, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, which gets all philosophical.  It's got all the heady stuff like \"Anatta\" (no soul), \"Dukkha\" (life is suffering), and \"Anicca\" (everything changes).  Get these ideas, and you can escape the cycle of death and rebirth, called \"Sansara\".  No more sufferin', no more desire, no more anger, no more delusion, just peace.  Now, the Vinaya Pitaka, it lays out the rules for folks who follow Buddha.  Regular folks gotta follow five rules: no killin', no lyin', no stealin', no messin' around, and no gettin' drunk.  Monks, they gotta follow a whole bunch more.  But the most important thing, the whole foundation of Buddhism, is the Four Noble Truths.  First, life is suffering.  Second, why we suffer is because we cling to things.  Third, we can stop suffering.  And fourth, there's a way to stop suffering, and that's through the Eightfold Path.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya 'bout these here U.S. and Mexico fellas. They got themselves in a right ol' tussle back in the day, lasted somethin' like 57 years, from '36 to '93.  You know, like two brothers fightin' over the last piece of pie.  They even went to war over it, back in '46 and '48, the U.S. took Texas and all that southwest land from Mexico.  \n\nNow, ain't this somethin' like when your neighbors always stealin' your lawnmower or somethin'?  Countries sometimes squabble over land, resources, and beliefs, ya know?\n\nThese two, they clashed over religion, culture, tradition, and even money.  Ain't that somethin'?  Just like how folks get their noses outta joint over who got the best BBQ sauce!\n\nYou see, the U.S. and Mexico, they're like those two brothers always at it.  The U.S. had a real hankerin' for Mexico's land, kinda like that fella who always wants the biggest slice of cake.  \n\nReligion played a part too, just like when folks argue over who's got the right way to worship.  Americans back then, they weren't too keen on Catholics, kinda like how folks might not get along if one's a hunter and the other's a tree hugger.\n\nAnyway, they had all sorts of disagreements, 17 of 'em, if you believe them books.  Most of it was over land and folks crossin' the border.  It was like a big ol' border dispute, with outlaws and bandits makin' trouble.\n\nBut eventually, Mexico kinda had to rely on the U.S. for help, kinda like when your neighbor needs to borrow your tools.  And the U.S., they started lookin' at Mexico's money more than their land.  So, the fightin' died down, like when two kids finally get tired of bickerin'.",
            "Fifteen years ago, somethin' happened to me outta nowhere. This sickness, one I never even knew existed, hit me like a ton of bricks. I was a nurse back then, ya know? I went into it 'cause I wanted that safety and security, somethin' I never had growin' up. Everyone was always sayin', \"You'll always have a job, folks get sick all the time!\" So, even though I dreamed of bein' a scientist or maybe a journalist, somethin' like that, I stuck with nursing.  \n\nBut there I was, 46 years old, single, nothin' saved up, and couldn't work no more.  This sickness, it took everything from me. Fifteen years on disability now, and I'm nothin' but broke.  Every day's a fight, a struggle just to keep my head above water. My security, my safety, my pride, gone. Ain't nothin' for sure anymore, but one thing I know for sure: I couldn't have made it this far without my family and a few good friends. Believe me,  when disaster strikes, you feel mighty weak.\n\nLife throws curveballs, big and small. You can plan all you want, but some things are just too much to handle alone.\n\nI agree, we gotta stop relyin' on the government for everything. That whole system's rotten to the core.  But instead of everyone buildin' their own little fortresses, how about we start trustin' each other again? Help each other out, ask for help when we need it. That's what this country was built on: compassion, respect, and lookin' out for one another.\n\nSure, they talk about rugged individualism, but the truth is,  our forefathers didn't make it through tough times by themselves. It was by lookin' out for each other.\n\nSo yeah, be prepared. I am. Got my disaster kit, first aid, water purifiers, even plastic to cover the windows if things get real ugly. Flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, and enough canned goods to feed a small army. If you got the land, grow your own food, learn to can it. That's a good idea, just like a wood stove, as long as you ain't livin' in an apartment.\n\nBut here's the thing: get to know your neighbors.",

They weren't too far off.  \n\nBut, some folks are tryin' somethin' new. They're usin' math to figure out how critters like these fancy snails, called Prunum, grow their shells. It's like, they take pictures of these shells, break 'em down into numbers, and then use computer programs to see what kinda crazy shell shapes they could come up with. \n\nThink of it like this: a shell's like a spiral staircase, goin' round and round.  Each step is a whorl, and the whole thing's built around a central pole, like the support in the middle. Now, these steps can grow bigger or smaller, and there are lines between 'em called sutures.  \n\nNow, imagine makin' a blueprint for this shell staircase. You gotta figure out how big each step is, how far apart they are, and how they all fit together. That's what these scientists are doin'! They're tryin' to figure out the rules of how these shells grow, and maybe even predict what kinda new shell shapes could pop up. It's like a puzzle, but with real live critters!",

But when it comes to makin' sure moms and babies are healthy, they fallin' way behind.  They ain't gonna make their goals by 2015 if they keep up like this.  \n\nWhy? Well, lemme break it down for ya.  They tryin' to say they got more midwives helpin' out with babies, 72% of 'em now.  But, a lot of these midwives are just regular folks, not real doctors.  They can't handle nothin' fancy, gotta get a real doctor if somethin' goes wrong. And that's why so many moms bleed to death after havin' babies.  \n\nThey also sayin' less babies are gettin' sick with diarrhea.  Maybe, maybe not.  They don't even know how many babies are gettin' checked after they born, so hard to say for sure.  But it ain't lookin' good.  \n\nNow, they doin' barely any C-sections, just 4%.  That's low, y'know?  In the cities, they doin' 7%, but out in the country, it's only 2%.  Seein' as how everybody goes to the city for fancy stuff, that's a problem.  Rich folks gettin' the good stuff, poor folks stuck with nothin'. \n\nThey got a whole lotta problems to solve, but the big question is:  Should they just keep doin' the same old thing, or should they fix the whole system?  Program-specific stuff is easier, quicker, and more focused.  But it can drain resources from other parts of the health system. \n\nThey need to decide what's gonna work best, and fast.  Babies ain't gettin' any younger!",
            "Victorian books are all about the little details and the fancy people who lived back then.  But there are two books, *Oliver Twist* and *Wuthering Heights*, that are kinda different. They have mystery and weird stuff going on, which wasn't really common in those books. This mystery stuff helps us understand the characters better, like what makes them tick and what they're really feelin'.\n\nHere's a bit from *Oliver Twist*:\n\n\"Suddenly, his head was full of all these confusing thoughts. He felt like he was walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were yelling at each other. He could almost hear them talking. Then he realized he was talking to them... But then BANG! Gunshots! He heard people yelling and saw flashes of light, and someone grabbed him and dragged him away. Through all this chaos, he kept feeling this weird pain that just wouldn't go away.\"\n\nThese books use mystery a lot, sometimes through dreams or things that feel like dreams. In *Oliver Twist*, these strange happenings show us what's going on inside Oliver's head, his hurts, and how he sees the world around him.  When he gets shot, it's like he's reliving it all over again in a dream, even though he's trying to find help. This part shows how out of control he is, how bad he's hurt, and those visions of Sikes and Crackit just make it worse.  He gets so overwhelmed that he doesn't even notice who's carrying him away. He's numb to everything except the pain, which is constant and scary now, not just a shock. It makes you wonder who's really in charge of his life, because it sure ain't him! This shooting shows that Oliver has zero control over anything. Even when he's in danger, he can't even try to fight back. It's like Fagin has broken him, making him give up hope. Otherwise, you'd think he'd at least try to save himself.\n\n\n*Wuthering Heights* also has mystery and dreams, but they work a little differently. *",
            "A couple years back, I was workin' in this after-school program, helpin' out the little rugrats with their schoolwork.  I was pretty good at English and readin', so that's what I mostly did. One day, this little fella named Adrian - think he was in third or fourth grade -  needed some extra help. Now, this kid was speakin' perfect English, but his readin' was all messed up.  Some letters, he'd read 'em fine, others, well, he sounded like a frog tryin' to sing opera!  It was mighty strange. I figured maybe he was just slow, but something didn't add up.   \n\nThen one day, while I was lookin' after a few stragglers, Adrian's momma walked in. Couldn't say a lick of English, just Spanish.  I was just learnin' a few words myself, but we managed to piece together what was goin' on. Turns out, Adrian knew how to read, just not the English alphabet real well.   \n\nI guess that's why he was havin' such a hard time.  It was like he knew the words, but didn't know how to put 'em together right.\n\nThat's when it hit me, see?  It ain't always as simple as it looks.  Even if a kid speaks English, readin' it can be a real struggle.  \n\nThat's why I'm sayin' we gotta do somethin' about the language barrier in schools, especially here in California.  Adrian's story shows us that it ain't always about the kid not knowin' the language, sometimes it's about knowin' the alphabet and how to put the letters together.\n\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' it's easy.  We gotta figure out what works best for each kid.  Dual language programs,  immersion, private tutors, ESL classes - all got their place, but there ain't no one-size-fits-all solution.  \n\nThe best thing to do is combine 'em all.",
            "Y'all ever think about what's bigger than us, you know? Like, somethin' we can't even wrap our heads around? Some folks go to church, others hit the temple, some try to figure it out on their own.  Lotta folks just go with what their parents taught 'em, but some, they say \"Nah, there ain't nothin' out there but what we can see.\" They live their lives in their own little world.\n\nMe, I've changed my mind about things a time or two, you know? What I thought was important one day, ain't so important the next. We all gotta figure out our own way, our own beliefs. We're all lookin' for somethin' to guide us, somethin' to make sense of it all.\n\nMy old man, he loved cardinals. We were sittin' on the porch one day, rain comin' down like crazy.  He was lookin' out at the storm, kinda like he was lost in thought. He wasn't lookin' so good, skinnier than usual, hair all thin. He didn't meet my eyes much that day. I felt kinda scared, you know? I wanted to tell him I loved him, but talkin' about it just seemed to make it all too real. So I just hugged him, sat next to him, and watched the rain.\n\nHe passed away a few months later, right before my 22nd birthday. They tried to help him with medicine and all that, but it didn't really work. He just suffered longer. God, what kind of God lets that happen, I thought. I didn't say no prayers, not that night.  If God was out there, he'd stopped listenin' to me a long time ago.\n\nI didn't want to watch him die. It was too hard. I wanted to remember him like he was, not like he was in pain. I knew him better than anyone else, better than his family did. I knew he wouldn't want me there. I just curled up in bed for a few days and waited for the news.\n\nNobody even called me.",
            "Alright, so this here \"Gothic Novel\" thing, it's like a real head-scratcher. You got folks sayin' it ain't got no depth, then you got others swearin' it's got this whole \"terrible sublime\" thing goin' on.  It's like a mix of old and new, kinda like my runnin' mate ideas, ya know?\n\nThis fella, Ian Watt, he wrote somethin' called \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel,\" and he says it's all a big ol' oxymoron 'cause it's both old and new.  He's talkin' 'bout how the first Gothic Novel, this \"Castle of Otranto\" by Horace Walpole, it took bits and pieces from old-timey romances and mixed 'em with this newfangled story-tellin' thing called the novel. Walpole, he called it a \"Gothic Story,\" and he used all sorts of theatrics and nature stuff to make it somethin' special. \n\nSee, back in the day, folks were usin' the word \"gothic\" for all sorts of things, like different people, styles, and even times. It was kinda like sayin' somethin' was old-fashioned or, well, kinda dumb compared to the \"modern\" stuff. But then you got this whole new way of tellin' stories, the novel, where the reader gets right up close and personal with the characters' thoughts and feelings.  And that's what made Gothic somethin' special, somethin' that could be both old and new at the same time.\n\nOne of the big things in Gothic Novels is this idea of \"Chivalry.\" You got these knights, brave and honorable, and the writers, well, they kinda miss that in folks these days.  Walpole, he was writin' during a time when things were pretty messed up politically, and he was scared about what the future held. Maybe he thought those \"good old days\" of chivalry had disappeared, and he wanted to bring 'em back.  In his book, you can see this in characters like Frederic. He's described as this prince who's been through a lot, suffered some tragedies, and is supposed to be dead. He's got all these chivalric traits, like a knight in shining armor. But, ya know, it's all kinda over-the-top, which kinda sets the stage for the whole Gothic thing, with all its drama and excitement.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya 'bout this 'supply chain' thing. It's like how ya get your stuff from wantin' it to havin' it in your hands.  It starts with a fella orderin' somethin', then it goes through all these steps: gettin' the stuff to make it, makin' it, stowin' it,  deciding where to keep it, gettin' it to the store, and finally, deliverin' it to ya!  This Keith Oliver fella, a smart guy, kinda made up the name 'supply chain management' back in '82. He said it's all about plannin', doin', and controllin' all those steps to make sure folks get what they want, quick and easy.\n\nNow, there are six big parts to this whole shebang: makin' it, gettin' the stuff, keepin' track of it, decidin' where to put it, movin' it around, and knowin' what's goin' on all the time.  Smart business folks use these six things to make sure their customers are happy.\n\nMakin' it's the first step. You gotta figure out when, where, and how to make the stuff.  Gotta know what folks want, right?  Look at the market, see what folks are buyin'. That tells ya what to make and how much. Then you gotta pick the right place to make it, one that can make it good and plenty, and keep the customers happy.  \n\nAfter that, it's all about plannin' when to do what and keepin' the makin' stuff in tip-top shape.  Makin' things right is real important, 'cause if you mess it up, it costs ya time and money in the long run.  I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target, and they had rules for everything, from how the workers dressed to how they got stuff off the trucks.  Keepin' things organized makes things run smooth.\n\nThe next big part is gettin' the stuff. That means figuring out where to get the stuff you need and who to trust to make it for ya.  Sometimes, you might have different parts of makin' somethin' in different places.  You gotta pick the best place for each part.  And sometimes, you gotta get help from other companies, 'cause they're good at somethin' ya ain't.  That's called \"outsorin',\" and it can make things faster and cheaper, but ya gotta make sure they do a good job.",
            "Well, lemme tell ya somethin'. This here Ellen Page gal, she's out on the street with a sign sayin' Hitler's still alive in Burma. Now, Burma, that's that Southeast Asian country where them folks been havin' a real rough go of it. They got this military junta runnin' the show, and they ain't exactly known for their kindness. Back in 2007, they had these big protests, them monks all wearin' their saffron robes, callin' it the \"Saffron Revolution.\" The government tried to shut 'em down, started gettin' rough, even attacked the monasteries.  They threw journalists in jail and even killed one, just for bein' there, a fella named Kenji Nagai. \n\nNow, this ain't nothin' new, see.  Governments always tryin' to keep folks quiet, keepin' all the power to themselves.  Back in Roman times, them emperors thought they were gods, rule everything.  Even them Japanese emperors, they think they're gods too, sent down to lead folks with cell phones and, well, that hara-kiri business. And don't even get me started on our own President, Bush.  He and that Ted Haggard fella, head of Stupid People Worldwide, they're always talkin' on the phone.  \n\nYou see, it's happened before, all over the world.  Like back in '89, them folks in Tiananmen Square, tryin' to protest the Chinese government, and the government just went and cracked down on 'em, killed a whole bunch of 'em.  And then there was that Rwandan genocide, Hutu folks killin' Tutsis, just because.  And let's not forget Hitler and the Holocaust, rounded up all them Jews and...well, you know.",
            "Listen up, folks! This Duke Ellington cat, he's a legend in the jazz world, ya know?  He stuck around for a long time, and he knew how to make his band sound real good. Now, he wasn't always playin' the piano loud and flashy, but when he wrote music, man, it was somethin' else! He made tunes so fancy and complicated, they let each guy in the band show off their own style.  Ellington was like the ringmaster, settin' up the whole show so these guys could go wild and improvise.  But he also knew how to make sure everything fit together, like a well-oiled machine, makin' each note sound just right.  He knew how to make each instrument sing, and how to get them all workin' together like a team.  That's why he wrote some of the best jazz music ever!\n\nThis guy Grove, he wrote a book about music, and he said Ellington was a real innovator.  He used his singers like instruments, not just for singin' words, but for makin' the music sound different and more interesting. One of his tunes, \"Creole Love Call,\" shows how he did that. It ain't no normal song, it's like a conversation between a voice and the instruments. The singer starts smooth and sweet, then gets rougher later on. Then you got this trumpet player, he plays kinda quiet and sad, but it's still real soulful. Then comes the clarinet, screamin' high notes, like it's tryin' to reach the sky!  And the whole band jumps in, makin' it a real party.\n\nEllington used all kinds of tricks like that in his music, makin' it sound like nothin' you've ever heard before. He knew how to make everything fit together, from the singers to the brass to the rhythm section. He was a real genius!",
            "She's always felt like somethin' was missin'. Like there was a hole in her life that just wouldn't be filled. It started back when she was about 14, just gettin' into all that teenage stuff.  And it was still there at 17, three years later. By then, she figured out she wanted someone, not some shiny new gadget or somethin'. But no boys ever really caught her eye. Some tried to, ya know, win her over, but nothin' worked. She wondered about it a lot, tryin' to figure out why she didn't feel nothin' for anyone. She thought about it for years, had all these theories, but nothin' ever really stuck. So she just kept livin', always wonderin' about what she was lookin' for.\n\nLife at home was usually pretty chill. Her folks were good folks, always calm and collected. They never fought, and even when she was pushin' back, tryin' to be independent, they never really got upset. She was the wild one in a calm family, always full of energy and fun. People liked her, she was a real sweetheart. \n\nBut today wasn't a calm day. She was walkin' around the house, tryin' to figure out what she wanted to do with herself, when she heard her mom scream from the kitchen. It was a sharp, scared sound. She rushed in, worryin' somethin' was wrong.  \"Mom! Mom, what's happenin'?\" Her mom was on the floor, holdin' her side, makin' little \"ow\" sounds.  Her daughter rushed to her side. \"Ouch... sweetie... I... need you to take me to... the hospital.\" She was talkin' in short breaths, in pain. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to pick you up.\" Her mom pointed, and her daughter, strong from all the workouts she'd been doin', scooped her up and carried her to the car. She laid her mom down in the back and drove as fast as she could.\n\nThe hospital smelled like medicine and sickness, and she was scared, but all she could think about was gettin' her mom help. She carried her in and yelled for a doctor. A bunch of worried faces gathered around, they pushed a bed over and laid her mom on it. They rushed her off, and her daughter was left sittin' there, waitin' and worryin'.\n\nLater, they found out her mom had fallen off a step stool while reachin' for a vase.",
            "So listen up, folks! This here study is about this thing called the \"Mediterranean Diet,\" or \"Med diet\" for short.  It's like a fancy way of sayin' eat your veggies, drink some wine, and enjoy life!  They found that folks who follow this diet, especially the \"aMed diet\" which is like the Med diet on steroids, are less likely to get those nasty heart problems, like heart attacks and strokes.  \n\nSee, the aMed diet is all about eatin' good stuff like fruits, nuts, and fish, and cuttin' back on the fatty meats and bad fats.  Plus, you can have a little wine with dinner, which ain't bad!\n\nDoctors have been sayin' for a while now that this Med diet is good for ya, but this study really focused on strokes and heart attacks.  They followed a bunch of nurses for like 20 years and kept track of what they ate and if they got sick.\n\nThey used these fancy questionnaires to see what everyone was eatin', and they found that the nurses who ate the most like Mediterranean folks were less likely to have a heart attack or stroke.  It's like magic!\n\nSo there ya have it, folks.  Eat your fruits and veggies, drink some wine, and you'll be lookin' good for years to come!",
            "Listen up folks, 'cause this here's a story about how our country, the good ol' USA, went belly up back in 2007.  Jobs disappeared faster than a squirrel up a tree, houses were worth less than a used tire, and even the big, fancy companies went bust. This mess ain't over yet, so let's figure out what went wrong and how to fix it, you hear? Well, it all started with some politicians playin' fast and loose with money. They pushed banks and companies to hand out loans to folks who couldn't even pay the electric bill. And meanwhile, these big shots at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, they were packin' up those risky loans like Christmas presents, sellin' 'em off to everyone and their uncle.\n\nNow, when folks couldn't keep up with their payments, the whole house of cards came tumblin' down. Banks were left with nothin' but empty pockets, and they passed the blame around faster than a hot potato. This whole thing started back in '99, when President Clinton was tryin' to stay in the White House. He wanted to look good for reelection, so he loosened up the rules on loans.  Back then, a fella named Steven Holmes, he was writin' for the New York Times, said right then and there that this was a recipe for disaster. He said it'd be just like the savings and loan crisis back in the '80s.  Well, ol' Steve was a prophet, wasn't he? \n\nThings got even worse 'cause folks were borrowin' money they didn't have, buyin' houses they couldn't afford. It was a real wild west out there. And then, the bubble burst. The price of houses went down faster than a greased piglet at a county fair. The big investment banks, they were left holding the bag, drowning in mortgage debts. Some of 'em went belly up, some had to sell themselves for peanuts, and the government had to step in and save the rest.",
            "Alright, so there's this thing called exposition, right?  It's when you gotta lay out the story's background, kinda like explainin' things to a slowpoke.  Sometimes it can be good, like when you're really hookin' 'em in, but most times, it's like watchin' paint dry.   You know, when your readers are yawnin' and wishin' they were doin' somethin' else, like countin' the cracks in the sidewalk. \n\nNow, I'm sure y'all know the sayin', \"Show, don't tell,\" but even I, ol' Dr. Merlin, trip up sometimes and get stuck in a whole mess of tellin' instead of showin'.  It's like when you're talkin' to someone and you just keep babblin' on and on about everything that ever happened, instead of just lettin' them see it for themselves. \n\nExposition is like that talkin' fella in a movie who just spills the beans about everything.  It's like, \"Hey, listen up!  Here's the whole story, from start to finish!\"  \n\nAnd trust me, nobody wants to hear that.  You gotta make 'em feel it, make 'em see it, make 'em understand what's goin' on without you just tellin' 'em every little detail. \n\nLet's say you're writin' a story about a gal who falls head over heels for this fella, they get hitched, and then BAM!  He gets whacked right in front of her.  You wouldn't want to spend two whole pages just tellin' us all that, would ya?  \n\nNo sir, you'd wanna show us how much they loved each other, how special he was to her, and how much she's gonna miss him.  You'd want us to feel the pain, to understand why she's so heartbroken.  \n\nSee, that's what exposition's all about:  makin' it real, makin' it feelin', makin' 'em care.  Don't just tell 'em the story, show 'em the story.",
            "Man, lemme tell ya 'bout these newscasts I watched outta Columbus, Ohio. First one was NBC 4 this mornin' (August 13, 2011), live and all. Biggest story they had was this fella in Ashley, Ohio, stabbed his wife somethin' fierce. Didn't say her name, but the fella's name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mugshot, looked like a real piece of work. They only gave him two minutes or so, which seemed right for a story still cookin'. All they said was he stabbed her a bunch of times and got hauled away. \n\nNext up was this young fella, Travis Buyers, 18 years old, shot up in Sharon Woods. Critically injured, poor kid. No one caught yet, SWAT team lookin' for the shooter. That story felt short, ya know? Makes me wonder if it was 'cause he was a black man, or livin' in a black neighborhood. 'Cause you know how it goes, when a white kid or grownup gets in trouble, the media goes bonkers. But when it's a minority, they barely give 'em a mention. \n\nThey did talk about a bullet hole in a Med-Flight helicopter, though.  .22 caliber, they said, from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers offerin' five grand for any tips leadin' to the shooter. \n\nThen they had a little chat 'bout the rain and thunder comin' Saturday. Said it'd be in the eighties all weekend.  Short and sweet, like they wanted ya to keep watchin'. \n\nAnd then this robbery at a UDF on Clime Road, Columbus. They went on and on about the robber bein' a black man, dark-skinned, six-foot tall, a hundred and fifty pounds. Seemed like they were really hammerin' home that he was black, ya know? \n\nLast story was about this Rene Rodriguez, some kinda drug kingpin from Texas.  Convicted of sendin' weed to Ohio.  Funny thing, they said he got sentenced to \"300\" months, instead of just twenty-five years.  Maybe they thought that sounded meaner?  Oh, and they mentioned he was Hispanic, which didn't seem too important to the story, if ya ask me.",
            "Brothers, man, they got this bond, like, nothin' can break it. You know, like when you're watchin' your own reflection, except it's your brother. It's love, pride, jealousy, even anger, all mixed up in there.  You see yourself in him, the good and the bad. And when things get tough, that's when you really see what that bond is made of, right or wrong.  But it ain't always pretty. That bond, it comes with baggage, ya know?\n\nThis story, \"The Scarlet Ibis\", it's all about that brotherly love, the good and the bad. These two guys, they're out there in this beautiful place, tryin' to do somethin' that ain't gonna work out. There's this pride, see, and it's like a fire, burnin' hot.  It starts with the older brother, he wants somethin' out of his little brother, someone to keep up with him, someone to share all the adventures. But the little brother, Doodle, he's different. He's got this heart thing, ain't gonna last long, and he can't do all the stuff the older brother wants to do.  Makes the older brother mad, makes him feel like he's been robbed. He even thinks about, well, let's just say he ain't happy with Doodle.  But then Doodle smiles at him, and it's like somethin' melts inside him.  \n\nThe story goes on, and you see that pride growin', and then, bam!  It all comes crashin' down.  They go on this last trip, and things go bad.  One brother makes it out, the other...well, you gotta read the story to see what happens. But it's all about that bond, about how love and pride can both hurt like hell.",
            "Dang, that brain of ours is somethin' else!  It's like a complicated gizmo, always thinkin' and creatin'.   Back in the day, folks thought it was like a wax tablet, then a piece of papyrus, then a book, and now they're sayin' it's like a computer.   But listen, don't go gettin' too hung up on that, 'cause these fancy comparisons only go so far. \n\nSee, all this thinkin' starts with our senses.  They take all these things we feel and hear and see and turn 'em into electrical signals.   The brain then takes those signals and messes with 'em, kinda like a recipe, makin' sense of 'em from the bottom up and the top down.\n\nLet's say you see a black box on a white background.  The bottom-up stuff, that's like lookin' at the box's edges and color and sayin', \"Hey, that's a box!\".   But the top-down stuff, that's like your brain already knowin' what a box is and sayin', \"Yep, that's a box, gotta be!\"\n\nNow, once the brain's got all that info, it's gotta decide what's important.  It's like a filter, lettin' in the good stuff and blockin' out the rest.  You see a whole bunch of grass, but your brain ain't gonna bother with every single blade.  But if someone calls your name in a crowed room, bam!  Your brain's all ears.\n\nTo keep all this goin', the brain's gotta store the info, too.   There's all kinds of memory, like short-term and long-term.   \n\nImagine you read a word.  Your brain stores it in a bunch of different ways: how it looks, how it sounds, and what it means.  Then it holds onto it for a bit, like somethin' you're workin' on right now.  And if it's important enough, it gets tucked away in long-term memory, like a file cabinet in your brain.\n\nNow, how all that stuff gets organized is a mystery.   Some folks say it's like a web, where ideas are connected like threads.   But nobody's quite figured it out yet.",
            "Alright, so this Huxley fella, he's got some beef with all this fancy technology and the way our money system keeps pushin' it.  In his book \"Brave New World,\" he paints a picture of a messed up future where folks care more about bein' part of the crowd than bein' themselves.  They're all about instant gratification, like a bunch of kids hooked on candy.  And the big boss man, the World Controller, he's like the puppeteer, makin' sure everyone's thinkin' the same way.\n\nNow, some smart folks who study stuff like money and power, they call themselves Marxists, and they see right through Huxley's story. He's talkin' about how things like sameness and makin' everything into a product, that's the problem.  It's like he's sayin' that our system is rigged, and the folks at the top are keepin' the rest of us in the dark about how it really works.\n\nThink about it like this:  the common folks in Huxley's book, they're just slaves to their wants and needs. They're pumped up on instant pleasures, buyin' and spendin' like there's no tomorrow. The World Controller, he's the one pullin' the strings, makin' sure they stay happy and dumb.  It's like a big ol' illusion, man.\n\nAnd the worst part is, nobody even notices! They're too busy chasin' their own tails to see the bigger picture. They're like sheep, followin' the leader without question.  Love, real feelin's, they're all gone, replaced by this phony, plastic happiness.  It's a real bummer, ya know?\n\nSo Huxley's story, it's a warning. He's sayin' that if we don't wake up and see what's really goin' on, we're gonna end up just like those folks in \"Brave New World\" - trapped in a world of fake happiness and empty promises.",
            "I been goin' to this here University Park for a couple years now, 'bout two and a half, maybe four and a half semesters. Now, gettin' around this campus is a real pain in the neck for most folks, includin' me. Back when I was a freshman, they stuck me in one of them East Halls dorms, way out east, past the stadium and that big ol' Bryce Jordan Center. Walkin' from that place to classes over by Willard, right in the middle of campus, could take you nearly 25 minutes, especially if the weather was bein' a real crank, which it seems to do a whole lot 'round here in State College. I was talkin' to a fella who graduated just a bit before me, and he told me that these East Halls used to be way out in the sticks, surrounded by nothin' but empty land. But now, they built all these new things - sports fields, fancy buildings like that new Creamery and the health place, and a bunch of apartments. It's gettin' harder and harder to get around with all this new buildin' goin' on.\n\nSo, what's the answer? How are we gonna fix this mess?  In my book, the answer is bicycles.  But it ain't just about havin' bikes, it's about havin' a campus that works for folks who ride 'em.\n\n\nI was talkin' to my friend the other day, and he just got back into ridin' after takin' a break for a while. He said he couldn't believe he ever stopped. \"Bikes are the only way to go,\" he said, \"It ain't cool to ride one for a while there, but it's the best way to get around.\" Bikes are good for ya, both physically and for gettin' places. A bowl of oatmeal and a little peddlin' and you can go 30 miles or more. Now, I live off campus, just as far from the center of campus as some of them dorms. Best decision I ever made this year was buyin' a bike. I got class in that Thomas building every day, and it's a good 25-minute walk from my place. But on my bike, I can make it in 5 minutes if I'm peddlin' hard. \n\nThe only problem is, that road, Pollock Road, it's the straightest way to Thomas, but it ain't always the easiest to ride.  Yeah, walkin' is good too, but I'm too busy for that. If I didn't have my bike, walkin' would be the only way to get to class.  Walkin' to Thomas every day would take another 30-40 minutes out of my day, that's over two and a half hours every week. And that's not countin' all the other walkin' I'd have to do to get to class, appointments, and all that other stuff.  Just ain't got the time for that."
