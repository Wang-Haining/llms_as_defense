            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "This paper is about Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD. We will look at the definition, diagnosis, and how a teacher can help a student with CAPD in a classroom.\n\nFirst, let us look at what CAPD is. CAPD is a problem with how the brain uses the information we hear. It is not a problem with hearing itself, but with how our brain understands what we hear. People with CAPD can hear sounds, but they have trouble understanding them. They may have trouble hearing in noisy places or understanding what people say when there is background noise.\n\nThe idea of CAPD was first talked about in the 1950s as \"auditory imperception\". Researchers were looking at children with communication problems. They started testing children in 1954, and in 1961, they developed a way to test how people hear sounds at the same time.\n\nCAPD can make it hard for people to do many things. They may have trouble finding where a sound is coming from, or understanding two sounds happening at the same time. They may have trouble recognizing patterns or understanding changes in voice. Sometimes, one sound can block out another sound. They may also have trouble putting together clues they hear to understand what is happening.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, doctors and other experts use tests. They watch how people react to sounds and use special tests to see how well they can hear. These tests may ask people to do things like listen to many sounds and choose the right one. There is no one test that works well for everyone, and we do not know what causes CAPD.\n\nTeachers can help students with CAPD in a classroom. They can help by giving them extra time to listen and pay attention. They can also help by reducing background noise and using visual aids to help the student understand what is being said. This can help the student learn and succeed in school.",

This is confusing and difficult for Viola.\n\nThe play may show that hiding who you are can help you understand your true feelings. Olivia and Orsino may have feelings they are hiding. But the play is not sure if this is true. It may be a way to make fun of people who judge others based on how they look. This is because Olivia easily falls in love with one man and then another. She seems to care more about her friends than her romantic feelings.\n\nThe play ends with Viola's true identity being discovered. Olivia says to Viola, \"You are my sister.\" This means Olivia accepts Viola as a person and not as a man or a boy. The play says that being true to yourself is important, even if it is hard.",
            "Many people note that German rule was very cruel, especially in German South West Africa. The German government killed many Ovaherero and Nama people. But this is not all that happened in the German colonies. The German colonies were different from each other in many ways. The German government spent more money on education in some places than in others. In East Africa, the British found many educated Africans when they took over in 1919. German education in Kamerun and other colonies was also good. \n\nBut in South West Africa, the story was different. The government did not help much with African education. Missionary groups did most of the work, but they did not have much money. The government, however, spent a lot on education for Europeans in South West Africa. This had a big effect on the colony even after German rule ended. In South West Africa, many people were still uneducated and illiterate. Other German colonies had many well-educated Africans. What made South West Africa different? This paper looks at the reasons why. It also looks at how German settlers and government officials thought about African people.\n\nThere is a lot of writing about education in the German colonies. Most of these writings were in German and were written long ago. They mostly described the education systems in different colonies. Later, some people wrote about the differences between the colonies and how education worked in each one. One writer, Cohen, compared education in South West Africa and East Africa. He said the number of European settlers in South West Africa was a big reason for the differences in education there.\n\nSouth West Africa was a good place for Europeans to live, with a mild climate and not too much desert. This is why many Europeans lived there. By 1913, 15,000 Europeans lived in South West Africa. In other parts of the German colonies, like East Africa, there were only 5,300 Europeans.",
            "Heavy Metal music has changed much over the last 100 years. Today, it is hard to list all the different types of music that fall under this name. Many of these types, like rock, country, and jazz, have their own smaller groups, or sub-types. Heavy Metal is a special kind of music that started 40 years ago. It is expressive and diverse. It shows a wide range of feelings, mostly sad or unhappy ones. People who make this music like to experiment and try new things. This has led to many new types of Metal music.\n\nIt is difficult to say what is really Heavy Metal today. This music has taken ideas from other kinds of music, but it started from somewhere. To understand Metal music, we need to know what it is and why it exists as a movement.\n\nMetal music is often about darkness. It is a type of music that is louder, more violent, and more exciting. People who make Metal music are good at playing their instruments. Metal music often comes from people who have taken drugs. In the 1970s, people used drugs and made music that was strange and new. This music was about the darker side of life. Later, people who made Metal music took inspiration from old music that was also about darkness. Some songs express this dark feeling, like the song \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles. This song was one of the first Heavy Metal songs and shows how music can be both sad and exciting.",
            "Henri Rousseau was an artist. Before the Surrealist artists painted dreamlike works, he was making his own dreams come true. His painting, The Dream, created in 1910, shows a woman who is in awe of the beautiful things she sees in a dream. It also shows Rousseau's own dreams and goals as an artist.\n\nRousseau wanted to be accepted by other artists and art lovers. But he had a problem. He wanted to be different and original, but he also wanted to be accepted by the art world. This was a big decision for him. He had to choose between being different and being accepted.\n\nTo understand Rousseau's painting, The Dream, we need to know a little about his life. He was born in 1844 in a town in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith. He did not go to art school, but he worked as a customs inspector. When his first wife died, he had a lot of sadness. He started painting to feel better.\n\nRousseau wanted to be a famous artist, but he did not start painting until he was an old man. Many other artists were already famous when he began. But he did not give up. He kept painting and finally got the recognition he wanted.\n\nThe art writer Jan Gordon said that Rousseau and another famous artist, Matisse, were different. Matisse did not want to paint in a simple way. Rousseau wanted to paint in a way that was simple and traditional so that people would accept him as an artist.",
            "Many smart people have said that there is a strong link between what is right and what is beautiful. I agree with them. Our brains immediately know that something is right or wrong, and we also know what is beautiful or ugly. One reason for this is because we do not learn these things from education or experience alone. We just naturally understand them. Our studies of right and wrong, and of beauty, are attempts to explain why something is right or beautiful, not to make rules for what is right or beautiful.\n\nCritics of art or morals cannot fully explain what is good or beautiful. Talking about why the Mona Lisa is a great painting may include words like \"light\" and \"color,\" but these do not explain why it is great. When we talk about our favorite book or painting, we often say there is \"something\" about it that is special. I think that both art and morals have this \"something\" that we cannot fully explain. This \"something\" is the most powerful part of art and morality.\n\nWe experience both right and wrong, and beauty and ugliness, at a deep level. This is something we can feel, but not fully explain. This connection between right and wrong, and beauty and ugliness, is stronger in literature. Literature is special because it has a moral message. It teaches us values that are important for living.",
            "Germany is a strong country today. It has a unique culture. This culture can be seen from the mountains in the south to the sea in the north. It can be felt from the city of Munich on the Alps to the city of Kiel on the Baltic Sea. It can also be seen in the city of Cologne on the Rhine River to the city of Dresden on the Elbe River.\n\nGermany was not always a strong country. The country has a history. Many people from different tribes created Germany. These tribes had their own culture. \n\nThe name \"Germany\" comes from the word \"Germania.\" This word has a disputed origin. Some people think it came from a tribe called the Tungrians. Others think it came from the word \"ger,\" which means spear. Another idea is that it came from the word \"garim,\" which means to shout. This could mean the Germans were loud.\n\nA long time ago, a Roman historian named Tacitus wrote about Germany. He said the Germans were not mixed with other people. They were a group of people who lived in a wild country with bad weather. Why would people leave their homes to come to Germany? Tacitus said people would not leave their homes to come to Germany. Instead, the Romans would go to Germany to get goods and to fight in wars.\n\nThe Germanic tribes lived near the Roman Empire. They traded with the Romans and joined the Roman army. This helped the Germans grow and become stronger.",
            "I looked down.  My mind was empty.  I was seeing something, but I was not thinking about it.  I was just looking.  A long time ago, I got some advice from an artist.  He told me to buy a book about drawing.  The book is called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\"  It teaches you how to draw.  One thing it teaches is to put a square around a picture you want to draw.  This helps you see the picture better.\n\nI tried to do that, but I could not.  I was seeing too much.  A bowl of fruit was in front of me.  It was on a table in a kitchen.  I could not see just the bowl.  I was seeing too many things at the same time.\n\nI remembered that some famous artists liked certain colors.  Picasso liked blue.  Monet liked green.  People from a long time ago liked many colors.  I was thinking that I could be an artist like them.  I was looking at the beginning of my picture.  I was looking at the start of my story.\n\nI picked up a pencil.  I wanted to start drawing.  My hand moved over the paper.  Water was calm and peaceful in my mind.  Then, my hand hit the handle of the toilet.  A piece of poop was stuck.  It would not go away.  I was trying to get it out.  I gripped the mop tightly and looked at the poop.  It was a brown, messy thing.  I was not happy about it.\n\nI waited a few minutes.  Then, I touched the toilet paper.  I wrapped it around my hand.  It felt like an oven mitt.  I bent down and put my hand into the toilet.  I was trying to get the poop out.",
            "Teenagers are dying while driving. Several factors cause this problem. The National Institutes of Health say one reason is that the teen brain is not ready for driving. Driving is a big responsibility. Most teenagers do not have enough experience. This makes them more likely to have accidents, including rollover accidents, speeding, and driving off the road.\n\nTeenagers also have more accidents when they drive with friends. This is a big problem. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center studied this. They found that the age of the passenger can cause more traffic accidents.\n\nTo make driving safer for teenagers, some states require a temporary license. This license limits the hours teenagers can drive and does not allow other minors as passengers. But these licenses are only temporary fixes.\n\nThe real problem is that most teenagers are not ready to drive. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman says 18 is too young for a regular driver's license. He did research that shows many young people like to take risks. This is why we should delay driving until they are older. If we continue to give driver's licenses to young teenagers, many more accidents will happen. Many more teenagers will die.\n\nWe can make laws to solve this problem. Schools can teach driving classes, but no one under 18 can drive. A temporary permit can still be given before a full license. Teenagers must also practice driving with an adult. The number of practice hours can be the same as in most states. This will make driving safer for all teenagers in the country.\n\nMy idea is not new. It is a simple way to make driving safer for our teenagers.",
            "I looked at films from the Library of Congress. They had many old Edison films. I watched all the trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films use editing to create illusions. My study was about the trick films. I looked at most of them and some of the later ones. \n\nMost trick films from this time are set in one place. They follow the rules of a play. The camera does not move. The shots are long or medium. This way is like a play or a magic show. The actors do not walk towards or away from the camera. They move side to side. \n\nOne film is Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors come in and move back and forth. They go out of the frame, but the camera does not follow. Most trick films have long shots and some medium shots. Close-up shots are never used. This is because in a play or magic show, the audience sees everything at the same time. \n\nMost trick films take only one shot to make. This is why they are short. They usually show tricks like magic, disappearing, or switching acts. However, sometimes one shot can be many pictures joined together. This creates the illusion of something happening. \n\nI looked at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895). It is a trick film. When you look closely, you can see where the physical shot starts, even though it looks like one shot.",
            "John Taylor was a strong supporter of Republicanism.  He was a farmer, but his farming work and short time in politics made him known for his strong opinions about freedom and government.  He wanted to protect and promote farming, the best job of all, in his ideas about government.  Taylor's belief in farming led him to think about many things, including how the government should be run.\n\nTaylor thought the United States had a good chance to create a perfect system of government.  This was because the country had no old traditions to follow, so the people who created the government could make their own rules.  Taylor believed in the natural rights of people.  He thought these rights are all connected - take away one, and the value of the others goes down.  He believed these rights should be beyond the power of the government.\n\nTaylor said that in the \"state of nature,\" strong and mean people have more power.  But he wanted this not to be true in a civilized society.  To create a good society, Taylor thought the government must consider both good and bad in people.  He believed that all government actions are good or bad, like people.  He thought good principles are those that protect private property, help farming, and stop selfish business.  A government with good principles would do what is fair, no matter who is in power.  Taylor believed that selfishness is natural, but it is bad when it hurts others.\n\nTaylor wanted a government that is very limited, with only the powers the Constitution says it has.  He thought a big government is expensive and could be mean.  But he also thought that following the Constitution too closely could be bad, without knowing the intentions of the people who made it.  Taylor thought the Declaration of Independence is more important than the Constitution, because it says the United States is a group of independent states, not one country.",
            "We look at Figure 17. The number of people who submit their commuter logs goes down sharply in the third month of the project. This is not good news. It is hard to know why this happens. One reason might be the cold weather in New England. Fewer people walk or bike to school in the winter. Also, December is the end of the school year. Students are busy finishing schoolwork and getting grades. They may forget to fill out the log. The holiday season starts in December and students go home for a month. They do not need to come to school. Classes start again in January. This might be another reason for the low number of logs. We started the Carpool Challenge Week in March. This was a special event to get people excited about the project again. It helped to increase the number of logs in March.\n\nWe had another problem. Many people like to drive their cars. This is a big part of our culture. We need to make alternative ways of commuting more attractive. We gave out prizes like gift cards to restaurants and coffee shops. We also gave gift cards to a bookstore and some stores. It would be interesting to know if bigger prizes would help more. For example, we could have given away a bike or a new car. This might have helped people stay interested in the project. The prizes did not change much during the project. If we had announced bigger prizes in December and January, we might have gotten more people to participate.",
            "An ETF is a type of security.  It follows a group of things like an index or a basket of assets.  But it is more flexible and trades like a stock on a stock exchange.  An ETF gives you the safety of a group of investments and the benefits of owning one stock.  You can sell it short, buy with borrowed money, and buy a small amount.  These benefits are attractive.  But there are some problems.  You have to pay a fee to buy or sell an ETF, just like you do to buy a stock.  One good thing about ETFs is that there are many different kinds available.  But it is always a good idea to check if the benefits are real and how big they are.  In this effort, we will look at the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 holdings.  We want to see if owning one ETF is as good as owning 10 different stocks.  We will also see if there is a better way to put these stocks together for a better return.\n\nTo make this easier, we will only look at the top 10 stocks that make up 63.58% of the ETF.  These are the stocks that make the ETF valuable.  Below are the top 10 stocks and how much of the ETF they make up.\n\nTo see how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF, we can use a formula to calculate their Beta and return.  We will use the percentage of the ETF that each stock makes up.  The results are in the chart below.\n\nFrom the chart, we can see that a portfolio of just the top 10 stocks would be 6.11% higher than the ETF.  This is a 16% increase in returns.  We can also see that the Beta of the top 10 stocks is .12 lower than the ETF.  This means that the top 10 stocks could give a higher return with less risk.  But we need to know if these results are real or just a chance.\n\nTo be sure, we will look at how much each stock can change in value.  We will calculate the standard deviation of each stock and compare it to the ETF.  This will help us see if the two portfolios are really different.",
            "One of Edgar Allan Poe's famous poems is called \"Dream-Land.\" In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe uses a word called \"Thulé\" two times. This word comes from Virgil, a famous ancient writer. Virgil used this word to name a place north of Britain. Many people thought this place was the edge of the known world. Poe liked the work of German writers. \n\nPoe's use of \"Thulé\" is important. It shows Poe knew the work of a German writer named Goethe. Goethe wrote a famous play called \"Faust.\" It was published in two parts, the first part in 1808 and the second part in 1832, the year Goethe died. In the second part of \"Faust,\" there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem is about a king whose wife dies after giving him a special cup. After her death, the king drinks a lot and cries. He then decides it is time to die and leaves his possessions to his children. He throws the cup into the ocean and dies. Poe's poem \"Dream-Land\" and Goethe's \"The King of Thulé\" are similar. Maybe one is a dark version of the other. This could be because Poe was thinking about his own loss and his drinking. A man named H P Grattan wrote a play called \"Faust\" in 1842, a year before Poe used the word \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" Poe mentions Thule twice in his writings. He uses the phrase \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and \"Dream-Land\" twice as a book end. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be read as two connected poems. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker talks about a dark and lonely place called Thule. He sees a world without color and is haunted by dead friends. This is like the story of the king in \"The King of Thule,\" who has lost his wife and is lonely. Goethe was a famous writer that Poe would have known. Poe admired another writer, Tennyson, who liked Goethe's work. Poe would have seen Goethe's work in many books that were published after the original publication.",
            "Under California law, can a person who got hurt after slipping and falling on a spill in a grocery store get extra money as punishment from the store owner? The store owner was told twice about the spill, but he did not clean it up for 30 minutes because he was eating dinner.\n\nA judge is unlikely to quickly stop the case. To get extra money as punishment, the person who got hurt must show that the store owner acted on purpose to cause harm. The store owner must have known that not cleaning the spill could cause an injury. The person who got hurt will argue that the store owner should have known this because many people had slipped and fallen in the store in the past because of spills. The store owner still did not clean up the spill.\n\nThe person who got hurt will also argue that the store owner's actions were very bad. However, this argument is not very strong. But it may still be valid because many people had slipped and fallen in the store in 2009, and the store owner did not take steps to make the store safe.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, an employee of the grocery store told the manager about a spill in an aisle. The manager said he was on a break and could not deal with customer complaints. Another employee told the manager about the spill 15 minutes later, but he still did not clean it up. At 5:30 pm, the person who got hurt slipped and fell on the spill and got a serious back injury. Before this happened, five other people had slipped and fallen in the store in 2009. The person who got hurt is now suing the grocery store for money to cover her medical expenses and for extra money as punishment.\n\nIn California, a person can get extra money as punishment if the other person acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Malice is when someone acts on purpose to cause harm. It can also be when someone acts very badly and with a clear disregard for the safety of others. The court has said that this is the case when someone knows that their actions could cause harm and still does not try to stop it.",
            "I studied Islam in a class at CBC about four years ago.  We had a big discussion in class about whether Islam is a hostile religion.  I think this question is still important today.  I have seen how the media's view of Islam has changed since 9/11.  At first, they had a negative view.  Later, they became too friendly.  I don't think in 2001 we could have elected a president like Barack Obama, who comes from a family with Muslim background.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad is interesting to me.  But it does not match the history I know of Muhammad.  I thought he forced people to become Muslims.  But the biography says he was a kind and humble man.  People came to him because they believed in his teachings.  I also see some similarities between the work of Jesus and the miracles of Muhammad.  For example, Muhammad multiplied food so there was enough for many people.  I think the writers wanted to show Muhammad as a humble man who did not need to prove anything.  It makes me think they are trying to take credit for the life of Jesus.\n\nThere are many stories in the biography that sound like they are trying to prove that Muhammad was a good leader.  But these stories come from second-hand information.  I don't think this makes them more believable.  It makes me question the truth of the stories.  I don't like this because it makes the stories seem suspicious.\n\nWhat bothers me most is that the biography tries to make Muhammad seem like a kind and wise man.  But history says he was not like that.  I think Muslims today should know the real story of Muhammad's life.",
            "The teachings of Jesus and the ideas he believed in are not what many Christians follow today.  If we look at the history of Christianity, we see that it has moved away from its roots.  In the past, people did not think about this.  Today, however, there is a growing awareness that things have changed.  Many people are thinking about what Jesus really said and did.  They want to know the true meaning of his teachings.\n\nSoon, a new movement will start.  People will try to understand what Jesus really meant.  They will look at the ideas that were added to Christianity over time.  This will take a long time, but it will happen.  Christianity will go back to its original form.  People will understand the true meaning of Jesus' teachings.\n\nWhen this happens, Christianity will become more like it was when Jesus was alive.  People will focus on his ideas, not on the things that were added later.  The church as an organization will still be strong.  But the differences between Christians will fade away.  Instead of being different from each other, they will be more alike.\n\nHistory is full of examples of big changes.  One example is how the Roman Empire, which once persecuted Christians, became a Christian country.  Our country has also had big changes.  From slavery to freedom, from being against African-Americans to having an African-American president.\n\nA big change is coming in the Christian world.  People will start to see Jesus' words as symbols, not as exact statements.  This will help make the change happen.  To understand what I am saying, we need to look at the history of Christianity.  Before Jesus, there was only Judaism.  The Jewish people had many different ideas and groups.  They had Sadducees, Pharisees, and others.  They did not all agree on what was true.",
            "The Jungle shows how people are naturally selfish. They only think about themselves and want a good life. They do not care about others who are lower than them. The book shows this in many ways. The owners of big factories want to make their companies as big and successful as possible. They do not care about anything that gets in their way or gets hurt because of their success. They do not worry about the pollution their factories make. They also do not care about their workers. They want to make money, not help their employees. The owners force their workers to work long hours for little pay. They can fire many people at once without warning. At that time, there were no laws to protect workers. The owners had too much power.\n\nThe book shows that the workers were treated badly. They had no help or organizations to turn to. Some workers tried to form groups to help themselves, but these groups were not very helpful. The workers were treated so badly that they were almost like slaves. They were always hungry and had to work hard to survive. They depended on their bosses for everything.\n\nThe Jungle is a sad story about how people are treated in a big city. It shows that some people do not care about others and only want to make more money.",
            "Many authors use special ways to give readers a certain feeling. Some methods are more effective. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these methods in his novel The Great Gatsby. He pairs words together that do not usually fit to give a special feeling. He also uses symbols to give meaning. Fitzgerald uses many colors to give meaning to important things. He builds up the meaning of colors like white, gray, red, and pink. He uses these colors to remind readers of a feeling.\n\nFitzgerald makes white and gray mean the same thing - uniformity. White is nice and gray is old and faded. He uses these colors in the beginning of the novel. Many characters wear white. Daisy and Jordan wear white clothes. People at parties wear white. Even the streets are white. But Fitzgerald also uses these colors for ordinary things. He makes the city streets \"white chasms\" and the cars \"gray.\"\n\nLater, Fitzgerald uses white and gray to show that something is not important. He uses these colors to describe Daisy. He says she is wearing white and is like a uniform. This shows that Daisy is not a special person, but just something Gatsby wants. Fitzgerald uses this technique many times to show that Daisy is like a uniform.\n\nFitzgerald uses colors to remind readers of a feeling. He uses red and pink to show something is important.

            "San Diego County is a great place for growing food. The weather is mild and sunny. Many crops grow well here, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, and herbs. Many people in San Diego want organic food. They are willing to pay more for it. This is good news for farmers who use special methods that do not hurt the earth.\n\nSome farmers in San Diego give tours of their farms. People can visit and learn about the farms. They can also walk and look for birds. This helps the farmers get money and help the environment.\n\nOrganic farming has many benefits. It helps plants and animals live in the area. But it is harder and more expensive than other ways of farming. Farmers must work harder to get rid of pests and weeds. They also need to put special food on the soil to help it grow.\n\nThe land I am talking about is near the town of Potrero. It is 160 acres of land with different kinds of plants and trees. Many animals live there, including some that are in danger. The government has a plan to protect them. The plan includes over 100 kinds of plants and animals. Some are endangered, like the kangaroo rat and the California gnatcatcher.\n\nPeople lived in this area a long time ago. Then, ranchers and loggers came. They used the land for many years. Now, a farmer could use the land for organic farming. I looked at a government program to see how a farmer could get help. I also looked at a real farm in the area to see what they do.",
            "Culture is a very important part of any negotiation. But culture is not the same as what it might seem to be. It is not a single thing. It is not the same everywhere. We should not say that all Russians are stubborn or that all Japanese people are accommodating. This is not true. Understanding a culture is not just about what it is, but also what it means. Knowing about a culture can help us understand how it will affect a negotiation.\n\nWhen we meet people from another culture, we think of them in relation to our own culture. This can lead to comparisons. To understand another culture, we can learn about its history or its customs. We should not try to change another culture, but accept it for what it is. This is especially true in negotiations, especially if we have less strength or power.\n\nCulture does not only exist between countries. Companies also have their own culture. For example, some companies value hard work and long hours, while others value relaxation and freedom. We can see this in the way employees dress, how they communicate, and how they are hired. Even within the same country, different companies can have different cultures. This shows that cultures are not always what they seem.\n\nValues are even more important to understand. They tell us why a culture behaves in a certain way. If a culture values saving face or harmony, a negotiator will not publicly disagree or argue. If a culture values hard work, a negotiator will not settle easily. Understanding these values can help us prepare for a negotiation. But it is also important to learn about our opponent and their needs to make a successful negotiation.",

We will assume they are both correct about the Christian God.\n\nTo compare their ideas, we will first look at St. Anselm's argument. He says we can find God in our own minds. He believes that because we think about God, God must exist. St. Anselm thinks we don't need to look outside ourselves for proof of God's existence. He says this is an example of faith.\n\nThomas Aquinas has a different idea. He thinks we can prove God exists using reason and what we see in the world. He does not need faith. Aquinas gives five reasons why God exists. He says that change, cause, chance, and order in the world all need a creator. He is saying that God must exist because the world is not perfect and has problems that need a solution.\n\nWe can see that their ideas are different. St. Anselm believes in faith, while Thomas Aquinas believes in reason. We will continue to look at their ideas to see if one is better than the other.",
            "A long time ago, in the fifth or sixth century, a prince was born. He would later be called Buddha. This man lived a long life and became very wise. He gave up the world and found enlightenment. His teachings started Buddhism, a very old religion. It is now 2,500 years old. Today, it is different from what it was when Buddha was alive. This change can be seen in many countries, like Sri Lanka. In Sri Lanka, people celebrate the water-cutting ceremony every year. Monks and normal people take part in this ceremony. It has some importance, but Buddha never taught about a celebration like this. Changes like this happen in the Theravada Buddhist community. They occur in both the monastery and the community of regular people. These changes happen because of internal and external forces.\n\nInternal forces come from people who follow the Buddha's teachings. External forces come from people who do not follow Buddhism. A hostile force is something that hurts the Buddhist community. A benign force is something that helps or does not hurt the community.\n\nLet us look at the basics of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists trust in three things: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is the Buddhist teachings. They are found in the Tripitaka - three baskets of text. The Sutta Pitaka has the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka has the rules for living, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka has the ideas about the world. These ideas are Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (suffering in life), and Anicca (nothing is permanent). Understanding these ideas can end the cycle of death and rebirth, called Sansara. Sansara is a cycle of suffering, desire, hatred, and delusion. When one becomes enlightened, these things go away.\n\nThe Vinaya Pitaka has rules for living. For non-monks, there are five rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not misbehave, and do not take alcohol. Monks have many more rules. The most important idea in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths. First, life has suffering. Second, attachment causes suffering. Third, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico had a long rivalry from 1836 to 1893. This lasted for 57 years. The worst time of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848. The United States won and got new land from Mexico. This included Texas and the American Southwest. The two countries had many problems, but the rivalry finally stopped before the First World War.\n\nThis is not unusual. Countries that share a border often have disagreements. These disagreements can lead to long-lasting rivalries. The United States and Mexico are an example of this. Many countries near the United States have good relations with it. However, Mexico and Cuba have had problems with the United States for a long time.\n\nOne problem between the two countries was religion. Many people in the United States did not like Catholicism. This was a major issue between the two countries. In the past, the United States and the Soviet Union had a rivalry based on politics. But the United States and Mexico had a rivalry based on religion. This was a problem because of the distrust between the English and Spanish.\n\nDiehl and Goerts wrote about 17 problems between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry. Most of these problems were about border issues. These issues included border raids from Mexican territory into the United States. The United States and Mexico finally stopped these problems when they used force to control their borders.\n\nThe rivalry between the two countries started to end when Mexico became dependent on the United States. The United States then changed its goals from expanding its territory to helping Mexico economically.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I got very sick with an illness I did not know about. I was 46 years old and a nurse. I chose to be a nurse because people always told me, \"You can find a job easily because people will always get sick.\" My dream was to be a scientist or a journalist, but I chose nursing instead.\n\nNow, I am disabled. I have been getting money from the government for 15 years, but I have nothing left. Every day is hard for me. I am lucky to have my family and some good friends who help me. When disaster happens, it is hard to feel strong.\n\nMy point is that bad things can happen in life. We cannot always prepare for them and need help from others. I agree that the government is not always reliable. But I think it is better for Americans to help each other and ask for help instead of trying to do everything alone.\n\nSome people say that America was built on individualism. But the pioneers who came to America a long time ago did not make it by themselves. They needed each other's help. So, be prepared for disasters. I have a kit with food, water, and other important things in case of an emergency. But it is also important to know your neighbors and help them.",
            "Why do living things change over time? Are there limits that influence how they change? In 1917, D'Arcy Thompson said that it is hard to explain even simple living things with math. Today, we still face this problem. Recently, scientists have used math to study how some animals grow and develop over time. Our study is exploring how math can help us understand how living things change over time.\n\nWe are studying the shell of a certain type of animal called Prunum. We want to know how it changes over time and how it has changed in the past. We used special pictures taken with X-rays to measure the shell's shape. We then used a computer program to create models of what the shell might have looked like in the past. These models help us understand how living things can change.\n\nA shell is like a tube that grows over time. It makes a spiral shape, with each part of the shell growing around a center point. This center point is called the columella. The shell grows in rounds, called whorls. Each whorl is connected by a line, called a suture. The last whorl is the biggest. The shell has a top and a bottom, a point called the apex and a base. The animal lives in its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nWe can look at a shell from different angles. There are four main views: from the top, from the bottom, from the side, and from the front. The front view is the usual way to look at a shell.\n\nTo count the whorls, we look at the shell from the top. We draw a line where the first connection between whorls starts. Then, we count the whorls from that line. We can only count a whole number of whorls. If a whorl is half done, we count it as half.\n\nA shell is like a path that the animal follows as it grows. We can use math to trace this path. We can then change the math to see how the animal's growth might have been different. This helps us understand how living things change over time.",
            "Indonesia's rates of baby and young child deaths have not changed much in the last ten years.  The country is almost on track to meet some of the goals from the Millennium Development Plan, like improving water and sanitation.  However, progress in health care for mothers and babies is slow.  This means Indonesia will likely not meet its goals by 2015.  There are many reasons for this.  We will talk about them below.\n\nOne good thing is that more babies are born with a trained health worker present.  Now, 72% of births have a trained worker.  But, even though this is an improvement, it is not as good as it sounds.  Many of these trained workers are midwives who cannot help in case of a problem.  This is why many mothers die from heavy bleeding.  There is still much work to do.\n\nFewer children are treated by a health worker when they have diarrhea.  We do not have complete information about care for new mothers after birth.  However, it is clear that this is a problem.  Few mothers and babies get the care they need.\n\nFew women have a cesarean section.  This is a problem.  The rate of cesarean sections is 7% in cities, but only 2% in rural areas.  This means that cities have better access to healthcare than rural areas.  This is unfair.\n\nAnother problem is that people with less money have a hard time getting healthcare.  In fact, there is a 27% difference in healthcare use between the richest and the poorest people in the country.  The poor cannot afford healthcare because they have to pay out of their own pocket.\n\nNow, we must think about how to improve healthcare for mothers and babies.  The main question is how to make healthcare services more available.  Should we make programs to help mothers and babies, or should we make the healthcare system better in general?  There are pros and cons to each approach.  Program-specific approaches are attractive because they are clear and can give quick results.  However, this can lead to problems.  When we spend a lot of money on one area, it can leave other areas without enough money.  Also, many programs can cause confusion and extra work for the healthcare system.",
            "Victorian novels are noted for their detailed descriptions and focus on the rich people of that time. Two famous novels that are different from this type are \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights\". These novels often use mystery and strange events to help readers understand the characters. This makes the characters more interesting and adds depth to their thoughts and feelings.\n\nIn \"Oliver Twist\", the main character has many strange and confusing thoughts. He is still seeing two men, Sikes and Crackit, arguing. The words they say are still in his mind. When he pays attention, he finds that he is talking to them. Suddenly, he hears the sound of guns and there are loud cries and shouts. He feels pain and is moved quickly away. He sees many strange things, but he is not in control.\n\nIn \"Oliver Twist\", the author uses strange events, like dreams, to show what is happening inside the main character's mind. In one scene, Oliver remembers a violent event that happened to him. He relives it as if it is happening again. He is very scared and in pain. He does not understand what is happening to him. The author wants the reader to see that Oliver has no control over his life. He is not in charge of what happens to him. The author wants the reader to feel sorry for Oliver.\n\nIn another scene, the main character says that time is passing quickly. A day comes and goes, and then night comes again. But it is not a normal day and night. The day is short and the night is long. The main character is very unhappy. He is in a difficult situation and it is hard for him to feel safe.",
            "A few years ago, I worked in an after-school program that helped elementary school students. I tried my best to help them in their difficult subjects, but I was good at English and reading. My boss asked me to help a boy named Adrian. He was in third or fourth grade and had trouble reading. I saw that something was strange. He knew some letters, but others he did not understand. He spoke good English, but his mother did not speak English. She spoke Spanish.\n\nOne day, I took care of him while his classmates went on a trip. His mother came in and we talked in Spanish, but I did not know much Spanish. I then understood that Adrian could read, but did not know the English alphabet. I hope he is doing better now.\n\nI tell this story to show that a language problem exists in schools, especially in California. Even if a child speaks good English, reading can be hard. I think everyone agrees that this is a problem. The solution for Adrian was simple: tutoring in English reading. But for children who do not speak much English, the problem is more complicated.\n\nThere is no one answer. We need to use many things together. We can use the dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, and ESL classes. But we must use them all together. \n\nThe dual language system is a good idea. It helps all children, not just those who speak Spanish. Children in this kind of program do better in school. Many people are afraid of this idea, thinking it is a waste of money and that most children will not benefit. But this is not true. If we use this system in all schools, all children will benefit.\n\nBut how do we do this? Do we need all teachers to be bilingual? No, that is not possible. We can have special helpers who are bilingual. They can assist teachers and students. This is a good idea.",
            "When we are young, people often tell us that there is something bigger than we are. This is something we cannot understand. Some people go to church to learn about it. Others go to the temple or look inside themselves for answers. Many people accept the religion their parents teach them. But some people do not believe in it. They think there is nothing beyond what they know. They may accept one idea and then change their mind and accept another. We search for meaning in life through our own ideas about spirituality.\n\nI asked my father about his favorite bird. It was a cardinal. We sat on our porch, listening to the rain. He looked out into the rain, thinking about something. He had lost weight and his hair was thinning. He did not look at me. I felt sad, scared, and could not talk to him about how much I would miss him. I hugged him and we sat together in the rain.\n\nMy father died in December, a few days after my twenty-second birthday. The medicine and radiation did not help him. They kept him alive a little longer. I wanted to remember my father when he was alive, not how he died. I did not want to see him go away. I wanted to remember him as he was, not how he suffered. I thought, \"What kind of God would do this?\" I did not pray to God that night. If God exists, I thought, he is not listening to me.\n\nI did not want to watch my father die. I wanted to remember him, not how he died. I knew my father better than anyone. I knew he would not want me to watch him die. So I stayed in bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one called me.",
            "The Gothic Novel is an interesting mix of old and new. This is exactly how writer Ian Watt describes it. The Gothic style has been both praised and criticized. Some people say it is shallow, while others say it evokes a feeling of the 'terrible sublime' (Burke). The first Gothic Novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, combined old and new ideas to create a new way to write stories. Walpole used old theatrical elements and new ideas to create what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic style uses ideas from medieval theater, architecture, and traditions. Even when The Castle of Otranto was first published, the word \"gothic\" was used to describe many things. Some people thought it was old-fashioned or not sophisticated.\n\nThe combination of the old and new ideas in Gothic novels is what makes them interesting. This is because the old ideas are presented in a new way, allowing readers to see the characters' feelings and thoughts more clearly. This is why Gothic novels have been popular for a long time, even though they were written a long time ago.\n\nOne important idea in Gothic novels is the concept of chivalry. Chivalry was a way to train knights in the Middle Ages. It meant being brave, honorable, and competent. Many Gothic writers, including Walpole, liked chivalry because it represented a high ideal. They thought that people in their time did not live up to this ideal. They used chivalric ideas and manners to make the past seem romantic and ideal. This is because Walpole and others wanted to show that people in the past were better than those in the present.\n\nWalpole wrote The Castle of Otranto during a difficult time in history. He was worried about the future and thought that people had lost the good qualities of the past. This is why he wrote about characters like Frederic, who was a prince and a brave and courteous knight. Frederic's description includes many traditional chivalric images. He has suffered a great deal and is now supposed to be dead. But he is actually alive and will return to fight for what is right. The idea of the gallant and courteous knight is an important part of the Gothic style.",
            "The supply chain is a series of actions that helps move goods from the customer's order to the final product. It includes getting raw materials, making the product, and delivering it to the customer. The term supply chain management was created in 1982 by a consultant named Keith Oliver. He explained how to plan and control the supply chain to meet customer needs quickly and efficiently.\n\nThere are six important parts of a supply chain: making the product, getting the materials, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these parts to give the best service to customers.\n\nFirst, making the product is the start of the supply chain. Making the product is the base for the whole supply chain. The making stage answers the questions of when, why, where, and how things are made. Before making the product, managers must know what customers want. They look at the market to see what customers need. The market shows what customers are asking for.\n\nAfter studying the market, managers decide what products to make and how many. Then they decide where to make the products and which factory will make the right amount of products for the customers. Managers also decide how to schedule work and take care of the machines. Making the product is very important in the supply chain. Every detail is crucial. If managers do not plan carefully, it can take a long time and cost a lot of money.\n\nFor example, I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target. Both companies have a plan for each part of the business. There is a plan for how employees dress and how goods are received from trucks. Having a plan helps the company work smoothly and avoid confusion.\n\nThe second important part of the supply chain is getting the materials. Getting the materials means making decisions about the company's strengths and weaknesses. A company may have many different departments that make different parts of a product. The manager decides which department is best for each part. The manager may also decide to ask another company to help make the product. This is called outsourcing. The main reason for outsourcing is to make the product quickly and with good quality while keeping costs low.",
            "A sign on a street in Burma, also known as Myanmar, says Hitler is alive. Ellen Page, a famous actress, holds a cardboard sign with this message. Burma is a country in Southeast Asia. It is ruled by a group of military leaders who took control in 1962. In 2007, people protested in the streets. These protests were called the Saffron Revolution. Many Buddhist monks led the protests. They wore yellow robes. The government allowed the monks to protest at first, but then violence increased. The military attacked the monasteries. They arrested and imprisoned journalists. A Japanese journalist was killed in 2007. The government says 13 people were killed, but a former army officer claims many more were killed.\n\nThis is not new. Governments have wanted to control their people for a long time. In ancient Rome, leaders thought they were chosen by gods. Japanese leaders think they are gods. Our current president has meetings with a man who says he represents a group called Stupid People Worldwide.\n\nThere are many examples of governments hurting their people. In 1989, people protested in China's Tiananmen Square. Many were killed. The number of deaths is not known. In Rwanda, a group of people killed others because of their tribe. Many people were hurt or killed. In Germany, a man named Hitler hurt many people because of their religion.",
            "Duke Ellington's place in jazz comes from his long life and his ability to make his orchestra strong. Ellington did not often play the piano in his songs, but as a composer, he wrote great music that showed how well his band members could play. He made a framework where musicians could improvise and also wrote music that used the special sound of each musician. This made his songs sound new and original.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary says Ellington's sound was special because he used the voice as an instrument. This is seen in Creole Love Call, a song he made early in his career. In this song, Ellington uses the voice to add color and texture without words. He also uses the voice to fit with the style of each musician. This song is a slow blues with six parts. Each part is different. \n\n- Part 1: A call and response between voice and wind instruments. The voice starts smooth, then gets rougher.\n- Part 2: A muted trumpet solo that makes the basic melody sound longer and uses some extra notes.\n- Part 3: A clarinet solo that sounds high and is backed by a piano that plays in a special rhythm.\n- Part 4: The whole band plays a call and response, just like in part 1, but with brass and wind instruments.\n- Part 5: The most exciting part of the song, where the wind instruments call and respond in a high sound, and the brass and rhythm instruments play in a special way.\n- Part 6: The song goes back to the start, with call and response between voice and wind instruments. This time, the voice sounds like a special instrument.\n\nEllington used the voice to make his songs sound new and interesting. In Hot and Bothered, he combined his good orchestration with his ear for sound. He used a call and response between a trumpeter and a singer to make a rich and special sound. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) shows how well he used a trombone player to introduce the melody.\n\nEllington's use of the voice in his songs is one way he made jazz special. He made his musicians sound good and created new and interesting music.",
            "She felt something was missing in her life. This feeling did not go away. It started when she was 14 years old. It was still there three years later, when she was 17. She wanted a person, not just a thing. But she did not like any boys. Some boys liked her. They tried to talk to her, but she did not like them. She often thought about why this was happening to her.\n\nShe lived at home with her parents. They were kind and calm. They rarely argued with each other. They argued with her only about her independence. She was different from her parents. She was outgoing and fun, and everyone liked her.\n\nToday was not a calm day. She heard a loud sound from the kitchen. She ran to the room and saw her mother on the floor. Her mother was in pain and saying \"Ow\" many times. Her daughter ran to her and put her hand on her. \"Mom, what's wrong?!\" she asked. Her mother said, \"Ow... sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital.\" Her daughter helped her mother to the car and drove her to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital had a bad smell.

            "This study had one purpose. It was to show that eating a Mediterranean-style diet, called the Med diet, can help prevent heart disease and stroke. We found that women who ate this type of food had a lower risk of these diseases.\n\nThe Med diet is a special way of eating. It includes more plant foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes. It also includes fish and less animal products and fatty foods. Drinking some alcohol in moderation is okay.\n\nBefore this study, other studies had shown that eating a Med diet can help lower the risk of dying from any cause and from heart disease. But they did not look at the risk of stroke or dying from a stroke.\n\nWe studied 74,886 women between the ages of 38 and 63 who were not sick with heart disease or diabetes. They were all part of a big study of nurses in 11 US states. We asked them to tell us about what they ate over the past year six times between 1984 and 2004. More than 95% of the women kept participating for 20 years.\n\nWe used questionnaires to ask about what they ate. We also checked to make sure the information was correct. We looked at the women's medical records to see if they got sick with heart disease, died from heart disease, or had a stroke. If we did not have the records, we considered it a possible case and included it in our study.\n\nWe also looked at other things like how much they weighed, if they smoked, if they took aspirin, if they took vitamins, and if they exercised. We took the average of what they ate over the past two years to get a better idea of their long-term eating habits. We controlled for things that could affect the results, like age, smoking, weight, menopause, and exercise.\n\nWe used a special method to see if eating a Med diet was linked to heart disease and stroke. We looked at the women who ate the most Med-style food and compared them to those who ate the least. We found that women who ate more Med-style food had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\nOver 20 years, we found 2391 cases of heart disease, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 deaths from heart disease and stroke. Women who ate the most Med-style food were less likely to get heart disease or stroke than women who ate the least. Their risk was 29% lower.",
            "In 2007, the United States had a big financial problem. Many people lost their jobs, and the value of homes dropped. The government and big companies were in trouble. We must ask: how did this happen? And how can we stop it? In short, the financial problem was caused by bad choices made by politicians. They forced banks to give money to people who could not pay it back. The banks also sold these loans to other companies, which created a big problem.\n\nThe financial crisis started in 1999. President Clinton wanted to be president again. He wanted to be popular, so he made it easier for people to get loans. This created a big problem for the future. A writer from the New York Times, Steven Holmes, wrote about this in 1999. He said Fannie Mae, a company that gives loans, was under pressure to give loans to people who could not afford them. He also said this could cause a problem in the future.\n\nMany things combined to make the economy worse. New types of loans were made, like loans with rates that could change. These loans made it easy for people to borrow money, but it also made them very vulnerable. When the housing market dropped, many people lost a lot of money. The top five investment banks in the US had $4.1 trillion dollars of debt in 2007. This was a big problem. Some banks were sold or shut down, and others were forced to change.\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two big companies that help people get loans, had $5 trillion dollars of debt. They were put under government control in 2008. This financial crisis was a big problem that affected many people.",
            "Exposition is a part of your story where you tell the reader important information. But it can also be boring. Dr. Merlin says she sometimes gets frustrated when she writes too much and her readers lose interest.\n\nYou probably know the writing tip \"Show, don't tell.\" But Dr. Merlin still makes mistakes and writes too much exposition. This is when you tell the reader too much information at once. It can be like a character dumping too much information on another character.\n\nExposition is like a big speech. The author is telling the reader what to know. In stories, this can be when one character talks a lot about something. In film, it's when someone talks a lot to another character.\n\nLet's look at an example. A story might say, \"The heroine met her husband at a place and time. They got married in a big ceremony. He was murdered in front of her.\" But if the story spends two pages on this, with only a few lines of dialogue, it's boring. You want to know more about the husband and why he's important to the heroine.\n\nYou should show the reader how much the husband loves his wife and how she feels about him. Maybe he says something kind or does something special. Maybe she thinks about him often or feels sad when he's not there. This helps the reader connect with the story and care about what happens.\n\nIn short, you need to add details to the story. You can't just say, \"They met, they married, he died.\" You need to show the reader why this is important. \n\nSometimes it's hard to resist telling too much. Maybe you're introducing a new character and you want to tell everything about him. But try to show it instead. For example, you might say, \"He used to be in the Air Force and now he works at a gas station. He likes fishing and dreams of owning the station one day.\" This is better than saying, \"He was in the Air Force, now he works at a gas station, he's been married twice, no kids, likes to fish, and wants to own the station.\"",
            "I watched two news programs from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was live from NBC 4 on August 13, 2011. The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio. He stabbed his wife. The police arrested him. His name was Shad Hostettler. The news showed his picture. He looked very bad. They talked about this story for two minutes. I think they said enough.\n\nThe next story was about a man named Travis Buyers, 18 years old. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area. He was very sick. The police did not know who shot him. They were investigating. This story was short. I think it was because the man was black. I have seen this before. When a white person is a victim of a crime, the news talks a lot. But when a black person is a victim, the news talks less.\n\nThe next story was about a helicopter that was shot. It was a Med-Flight helicopter. The police think it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. They want people to help find the person who shot the helicopter. They are offering a reward of $5,000.\n\nThe news also talked about the weather. They said it would rain and be hot on Saturday afternoon. The temperature would be in the mid to low eighties all weekend. They wanted to keep people watching.\n\nAnother story was about a robbery at a store in Columbus. A black man robbed the store. He was wearing a hoodie and was about 6 feet tall and 150 pounds. The news talked a lot about how black he was.\n\nThe last story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez. He was a big drug dealer from Texas. He was caught for selling a lot of marijuana in Ohio. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison. The news said he would be in prison for 300 months.

            "There is a strong connection between brothers. This connection can be very good or very bad. It is made up of many feelings: love, pride, jealousy, and anger. Brothers know each other very well. They can see themselves in each other. When brothers are very sad or in big trouble, their true feelings are shown. These feelings can have big costs. To understand brothers, you must understand the problems that come with their feelings. When you can look at a brother and see yourself, you see yourself in a real way.\n\nIn a story called \"The Scarlet Ibis\", two brothers deal with these feelings. They go on a hard journey in a beautiful place. They are very disappointed and very proud at the same time. Only one brother survives. The story shows how one brother feels through how he acts and what he does. The narrator also tells us how the brother feels and what he sees in the world around him. This helps us understand why he does the things he does.\n\nThe big feeling that drives the brother is pride. From the time he and his little brother Doodle go out together, the brother feels angry at Doodle. He wanted a brother who could do things with him, like running and climbing trees. But Doodle was sick and could not do these things. This was hard for the brother to accept. He even thought about hurting Doodle. But when Doodle smiled, the brother's anger went away. This shows that the brother truly loved his brother.",
            "The human brain is a very complex system. It helps us think and remember. A long time ago, people thought of the brain like a clay tablet. Then they thought of it like a piece of paper. Next, it was like a book. Now, some people think of it like a computer. These ideas are not perfect. They can lead to mistakes.\n\nInformation gets into the brain from our senses. Our senses include our eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin. They turn things like touch, heat, and light into electrical signals. The brain uses these signals to understand the world.\n\nThe brain works in two ways. Bottom-up means breaking down information into small parts. Top-down means using what we already know to help us understand. For example, when you see a picture of a black box, the brain first looks at the colors and edges. Then it uses what it knows about boxes to decide what it is.\n\nThe brain also has a filter. It decides what information is important and what we should pay attention to. We might see many things, but we only pay attention to some of them. Our brain can pick out our name in a loud room, but we might not notice every small thing around us.\n\nThe brain needs a place to store information. It has three kinds of memory: sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is stored. There are different ways to store different kinds of information. For example, our brains store words in different ways, like how they look, how they sound, and what they mean.\n\nInformation is not just stored, it must also be kept safe. Some studies on animals show that the brain keeps information in working memory for about 20 seconds by sending an electrical signal through a group of brain cells. Long-term memory is thought to be stored in the shape of certain kinds of proteins.\n\nThere are many ways to think about how the brain stores knowledge. Some come from people's memories, some from computers, and some from studying how the brain works. One idea is that the brain is like a network of connected ideas. For example, if we think of a chair, we might also think of a table, which we might think of as made of wood.",
            "Aldous Huxley is worried about the future. He writes a book called Brave New World to show how people might live in a world controlled by technology and capitalism. In this world, people care more about being happy now than about being an individual. From a young age, they are taught to be happy and not to think deeply. The people in this world are not really in charge. They are controlled by the World Controller. \n\nWe can see that Huxley does not like this kind of society. He uses ideas from Marxism to show his worries. Marxism is a way of thinking about how societies work. Huxley uses words from Marxism, like \"homogeny\" and \"reification\", to show that he is worried about the way people live in his world. \n\nIn Brave New World, people do not know about the real world. They are too busy looking after themselves. They are not allowed to think about their place in society. They are happy to buy things and enjoy themselves. The people in charge, the Alphas and Betas, do not care about fairness. They are happy to take what they want. \n\nIn Brave New World, people do not love each other. They do not feel strong emotions. They just want to be happy. They talk about each other's bodies, not their feelings. This shows that Huxley thinks that technology and capitalism are taking away people's freedom to feel and think deeply. \n\nThe people in Brave New World are happy to obey the rules. They do not want to change the way things are. This is like what Marx said about the proletariat, the working class. They are fooled into thinking they are better than others as long as they keep buying and following the rules.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for about two and a half years. Getting around campus can be difficult. My freshman year, I lived in East Halls dorm, which is far from the center of campus. It took me 25 minutes to walk to classes in the Willard building on bad days. The weather in State College can be bad.\n\nI talked to an old friend who rides a bike. He said it is the best way to get around campus. Bicycling is good for your body and is the most efficient way to travel. You can eat a bowl of oatmeal and ride your bike 30 miles or more. I now live off campus, far from the center of campus. I bought a bike this year, and it was a good decision. My classes are in the Thomas building, which is 25 minutes away on foot. But on a bike, it takes only 5 minutes. The road I take, Pollock Road, is not always easy to ride on.\n\nWalking is also a good option, but I am too busy to walk. If I didn't have a bike, I would have to walk to Thomas building every day. That would take 30-40 minutes. That is 2.5 hours every week. I don't have that much time."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "I want to get a degree in social work. This will help me have a good career with the Division of Family and Children Services. My goal is to help children who are abused or neglected, and help troubled families.\n\nImportant values I can bring to social work are: helping others, respecting people, being honest, and working hard to be good at my job. These values are not just important for social workers. They are also important for me as a person.\n\nI have always wanted to help others. But I was not sure what career I wanted. In high school and college, I saw many people ignore their problems and deal with them in not-so-good ways. I got a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College in 2009. After I graduated, I was still not sure what I wanted to do.\n\nOne day, a friend showed me a sixteen-year-old boy who was very nervous. He was visiting because his parents were being mean to him. The next day, I learned he had called the police. I went to his parents' house to see if I could help. I told the police I had a degree in Psychology and asked if I could talk to the parents. They were nervous and said their son was being manipulative. This made me think I wanted to help children with problems like this.\n\nAnother important value for social work is fairness. We say that every person is important. But we also try to be like everyone else. I like to be different. I like to express myself through my hair, clothes, and body. I also want to be fair to everyone. In high school and college, I tried to fight for what is right. I wore colorful hair, earrings, and declared my support for the GSBA. I also fought against racism and other types of unfairness. I will continue to fight for what is right.",
            "This report is about two models related to insomnia. The biological model looks at genetics and health problems. The sociocultural model looks at how the environment affects people. This report will examine these models and explain some research about insomnia.\n\nInsomnia is a sleep problem. It can be caused by a medical condition, a mental health problem, or another issue. There are different kinds of sleep disorders. Some are problems with falling asleep or staying asleep. Others are caused by mental health problems.\n\nThe biological model of sleep problems looks at genetics and health. Some research suggests that certain genes can affect sleep. This study looked at mice and found that a special group of cells in the brain helps people sleep and wake up. When these cells are working correctly, people sleep well. If they are not working correctly, people may have trouble sleeping. This study also found that a medicine called baclofen can help people sleep. This means that genetics and the environment can affect how well people sleep.\n\nThe sociocultural model looks at how the environment affects people. If someone has insomnia, it can be because of their genetics. This means that they may be more likely to have trouble sleeping. This can affect their daily life and make it hard for them to focus and do things.\n\nThe biological model of sleep problems focuses on genes and health. Research has shown that certain genes can affect sleep. For example, a study found that a special group of cells in the brain helps people sleep and wake up. When these cells are working correctly, people sleep well. If they are not working correctly, people may have trouble sleeping.\n\nThe sociocultural model of sleep problems looks at how the environment affects people.

            "This paper is about Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD. We will look at the definition, diagnosis, and how a teacher can help a student with CAPD in a classroom.\n\nFirst, let us look at what CAPD is. CAPD is a problem with how the brain uses the information we hear. It is not a problem with hearing itself, but with how our brain understands what we hear. People with CAPD can hear sounds, but they have trouble understanding them. They may have trouble hearing in noisy places or understanding what people say when there is background noise.\n\nThe idea of CAPD was first talked about in the 1950s as \"auditory imperception\". Researchers were looking at children with communication problems. They started testing children in 1954, and in 1961, they developed a way to test how people hear sounds at the same time.\n\nCAPD can make it hard for people to do many things. They may have trouble finding where a sound is coming from, or understanding two sounds happening at the same time. They may have trouble recognizing patterns or understanding changes in voice. Sometimes, one sound can block out another sound. They may also have trouble putting together clues they hear to understand what is happening.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, doctors and other experts use tests. They watch how people react to sounds and use special tests to see how well they can hear. These tests may ask people to do things like listen to many sounds and choose the right one. There is no one test that works well for everyone, and we do not know what causes CAPD.\n\nTeachers can help students with CAPD in a classroom. They can help by giving them extra time to listen and pay attention. They can also help by reducing background noise and using visual aids to help the student understand what is being said. This can help the student learn and succeed in school.",
            "The play Twelfth Night says that disguise can be useful for tricking people. But it can also cause big problems. If you hide who you are, you may lose yourself. The play says you must choose between saving yourself or the relationships you have with others.\n\nThe play is about gender role reversal. This means men and women change places. This is a problem because it raises many questions. Why do people want to change their roles? In the play, a woman named Viola wants to be a man to protect herself. She is afraid of being hurt. Viola's plan works, but it also hurts her relationships with other women.\n\nViola is so good at acting like a man that a woman named Olivia falls in love with her. Olivia thinks Viola is a man named Sebastian. Viola also has feelings for a man named Orsino. But Orsino does not love Viola. He thinks she is a boy named Cesario. This is confusing and difficult for Viola.\n\nThe play may show that hiding who you are can help you understand your true feelings. Olivia and Orsino may have feelings they are hiding. But the play is not sure if this is true. It may be a way to make fun of people who judge others based on how they look. This is because Olivia easily falls in love with one man and then another. She seems to care more about her friends than her romantic feelings.\n\nThe play ends with Viola's true identity being discovered. Olivia says to Viola, \"You are my sister.\" This means Olivia accepts Viola as a person and not as a man or a boy. The play says that being true to yourself is important, even if it is hard.",
            "Many people note that German rule was very cruel, especially in German South West Africa. The German government killed many Ovaherero and Nama people. But this is not all that happened in the German colonies. The German colonies were different from each other in many ways. The German government spent more money on education in some places than in others. In East Africa, the British found many educated Africans when they took over in 1919. German education in Kamerun and other colonies was also good. \n\nBut in South West Africa, the story was different. The government did not help much with African education. Missionary groups did most of the work, but they did not have much money. The government, however, spent a lot on education for Europeans in South West Africa. This had a big effect on the colony even after German rule ended. In South West Africa, many people were still uneducated and illiterate. Other German colonies had many well-educated Africans. What made South West Africa different? This paper looks at the reasons why. It also looks at how German settlers and government officials thought about African people.\n\nThere is a lot of writing about education in the German colonies. Most of these writings were in German and were written long ago. They mostly described the education systems in different colonies. Later, some people wrote about the differences between the colonies and how education worked in each one. One writer, Cohen, compared education in South West Africa and East Africa. He said the number of European settlers in South West Africa was a big reason for the differences in education there.\n\nSouth West Africa was a good place for Europeans to live, with a mild climate and not too much desert. This is why many Europeans lived there. By 1913, 15,000 Europeans lived in South West Africa. In other parts of the German colonies, like East Africa, there were only 5,300 Europeans.",
            "Heavy Metal music has changed much over the last 100 years. Today, it is hard to list all the different types of music that fall under this name. Many of these types, like rock, country, and jazz, have their own smaller groups, or sub-types. Heavy Metal is a special kind of music that started 40 years ago. It is expressive and diverse. It shows a wide range of feelings, mostly sad or unhappy ones. People who make this music like to experiment and try new things. This has led to many new types of Metal music.\n\nIt is difficult to say what is really Heavy Metal today. This music has taken ideas from other kinds of music, but it started from somewhere. To understand Metal music, we need to know what it is and why it exists as a movement.\n\nMetal music is often about darkness. It is a type of music that is louder, more violent, and more exciting. People who make Metal music are good at playing their instruments. Metal music often comes from people who have taken drugs. In the 1970s, people used drugs and made music that was strange and new. This music was about the darker side of life. Later, people who made Metal music took inspiration from old music that was also about darkness. Some songs express this dark feeling, like the song \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles. This song was one of the first Heavy Metal songs and shows how music can be both sad and exciting.",
            "Henri Rousseau was an artist. Before the Surrealist artists painted dreamlike works, he was making his own dreams come true. His painting, The Dream, created in 1910, shows a woman who is in awe of the beautiful things she sees in a dream. It also shows Rousseau's own dreams and goals as an artist.\n\nRousseau wanted to be accepted by other artists and art lovers. But he had a problem. He wanted to be different and original, but he also wanted to be accepted by the art world. This was a big decision for him. He had to choose between being different and being accepted.\n\nTo understand Rousseau's painting, The Dream, we need to know a little about his life. He was born in 1844 in a town in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith. He did not go to art school, but he worked as a customs inspector. When his first wife died, he had a lot of sadness. He started painting to feel better.\n\nRousseau wanted to be a famous artist, but he did not start painting until he was an old man. Many other artists were already famous when he began. But he did not give up. He kept painting and finally got the recognition he wanted.\n\nThe art writer Jan Gordon said that Rousseau and another famous artist, Matisse, were different. Matisse did not want to paint in a simple way. Rousseau wanted to paint in a way that was simple and traditional so that people would accept him as an artist.",
            "Many smart people have said that there is a strong link between what is right and what is beautiful. I agree with them. Our brains immediately know that something is right or wrong, and we also know what is beautiful or ugly. One reason for this is because we do not learn these things from education or experience alone. We just naturally understand them. Our studies of right and wrong, and of beauty, are attempts to explain why something is right or beautiful, not to make rules for what is right or beautiful.\n\nCritics of art or morals cannot fully explain what is good or beautiful. Talking about why the Mona Lisa is a great painting may include words like \"light\" and \"color,\" but these do not explain why it is great. When we talk about our favorite book or painting, we often say there is \"something\" about it that is special. I think that both art and morals have this \"something\" that we cannot fully explain. This \"something\" is the most powerful part of art and morality.\n\nWe experience both right and wrong, and beauty and ugliness, at a deep level. This is something we can feel, but not fully explain. This connection between right and wrong, and beauty and ugliness, is stronger in literature. Literature is special because it has a moral message. It teaches us values that are important for living.",
            "Germany is a strong country today. It has a unique culture. This culture can be seen from the mountains in the south to the sea in the north. It can be felt from the city of Munich on the Alps to the city of Kiel on the Baltic Sea. It can also be seen in the city of Cologne on the Rhine River to the city of Dresden on the Elbe River.\n\nGermany was not always a strong country. The country has a history. Many people from different tribes created Germany. These tribes had their own culture. \n\nThe name \"Germany\" comes from the word \"Germania.\" This word has a disputed origin. Some people think it came from a tribe called the Tungrians. Others think it came from the word \"ger,\" which means spear. Another idea is that it came from the word \"garim,\" which means to shout. This could mean the Germans were loud.\n\nA long time ago, a Roman historian named Tacitus wrote about Germany. He said the Germans were not mixed with other people. They were a group of people who lived in a wild country with bad weather. Why would people leave their homes to come to Germany? Tacitus said people would not leave their homes to come to Germany. Instead, the Romans would go to Germany to get goods and to fight in wars.\n\nThe Germanic tribes lived near the Roman Empire. They traded with the Romans and joined the Roman army. This helped the Germans grow and become stronger.",
            "I looked down.  My mind was empty.  I was seeing something, but I was not thinking about it.  I was just looking.  A long time ago, I got some advice from an artist.  He told me to buy a book about drawing.  The book is called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\"  It teaches you how to draw.  One thing it teaches is to put a square around a picture you want to draw.  This helps you see the picture better.\n\nI tried to do that, but I could not.  I was seeing too much.  A bowl of fruit was in front of me.  It was on a table in a kitchen.  I could not see just the bowl.  I was seeing too many things at the same time.\n\nI remembered that some famous artists liked certain colors.  Picasso liked blue.  Monet liked green.  People from a long time ago liked many colors.  I was thinking that I could be an artist like them.  I was looking at the beginning of my picture.  I was looking at the start of my story.\n\nI picked up a pencil.  I wanted to start drawing.  My hand moved over the paper.  Water was calm and peaceful in my mind.  Then, my hand hit the handle of the toilet.  A piece of poop was stuck.  It would not go away.  I was trying to get it out.  I gripped the mop tightly and looked at the poop.  It was a brown, messy thing.  I was not happy about it.\n\nI waited a few minutes.  Then, I touched the toilet paper.  I wrapped it around my hand.  It felt like an oven mitt.  I bent down and put my hand into the toilet.  I was trying to get the poop out.",
            "Teenagers are dying while driving. Several factors cause this problem. The National Institutes of Health say one reason is that the teen brain is not ready for driving. Driving is a big responsibility. Most teenagers do not have enough experience. This makes them more likely to have accidents, including rollover accidents, speeding, and driving off the road.\n\nTeenagers also have more accidents when they drive with friends. This is a big problem. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center studied this. They found that the age of the passenger can cause more traffic accidents.\n\nTo make driving safer for teenagers, some states require a temporary license. This license limits the hours teenagers can drive and does not allow other minors as passengers. But these licenses are only temporary fixes.\n\nThe real problem is that most teenagers are not ready to drive. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman says 18 is too young for a regular driver's license. He did research that shows many young people like to take risks. This is why we should delay driving until they are older. If we continue to give driver's licenses to young teenagers, many more accidents will happen. Many more teenagers will die.\n\nWe can make laws to solve this problem. Schools can teach driving classes, but no one under 18 can drive. A temporary permit can still be given before a full license. Teenagers must also practice driving with an adult. The number of practice hours can be the same as in most states. This will make driving safer for all teenagers in the country.\n\nMy idea is not new. It is a simple way to make driving safer for our teenagers.",
            "I looked at films from the Library of Congress. They had many old Edison films. I watched all the trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films use editing to create illusions. My study was about the trick films. I looked at most of them and some of the later ones. \n\nMost trick films from this time are set in one place. They follow the rules of a play. The camera does not move. The shots are long or medium. This way is like a play or a magic show. The actors do not walk towards or away from the camera. They move side to side. \n\nOne film is Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors come in and move back and forth. They go out of the frame, but the camera does not follow. Most trick films have long shots and some medium shots. Close-up shots are never used. This is because in a play or magic show, the audience sees everything at the same time. \n\nMost trick films take only one shot to make. This is why they are short. They usually show tricks like magic, disappearing, or switching acts. However, sometimes one shot can be many pictures joined together. This creates the illusion of something happening. \n\nI looked at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895). It is a trick film. When you look closely, you can see where the physical shot starts, even though it looks like one shot.",
            "John Taylor was a strong supporter of Republicanism.  He was a farmer, but his farming work and short time in politics made him known for his strong opinions about freedom and government.  He wanted to protect and promote farming, the best job of all, in his ideas about government.  Taylor's belief in farming led him to think about many things, including how the government should be run.\n\nTaylor thought the United States had a good chance to create a perfect system of government.  This was because the country had no old traditions to follow, so the people who created the government could make their own rules.  Taylor believed in the natural rights of people.  He thought these rights are all connected - take away one, and the value of the others goes down.  He believed these rights should be beyond the power of the government.\n\nTaylor said that in the \"state of nature,\" strong and mean people have more power.  But he wanted this not to be true in a civilized society.  To create a good society, Taylor thought the government must consider both good and bad in people.  He believed that all government actions are good or bad, like people.  He thought good principles are those that protect private property, help farming, and stop selfish business.  A government with good principles would do what is fair, no matter who is in power.  Taylor believed that selfishness is natural, but it is bad when it hurts others.\n\nTaylor wanted a government that is very limited, with only the powers the Constitution says it has.  He thought a big government is expensive and could be mean.  But he also thought that following the Constitution too closely could be bad, without knowing the intentions of the people who made it.  Taylor thought the Declaration of Independence is more important than the Constitution, because it says the United States is a group of independent states, not one country.",
            "We look at Figure 17. The number of people who submit their commuter logs goes down sharply in the third month of the project. This is not good news. It is hard to know why this happens. One reason might be the cold weather in New England. Fewer people walk or bike to school in the winter. Also, December is the end of the school year. Students are busy finishing schoolwork and getting grades. They may forget to fill out the log. The holiday season starts in December and students go home for a month. They do not need to come to school. Classes start again in January. This might be another reason for the low number of logs. We started the Carpool Challenge Week in March. This was a special event to get people excited about the project again. It helped to increase the number of logs in March.\n\nWe had another problem. Many people like to drive their cars. This is a big part of our culture. We need to make alternative ways of commuting more attractive. We gave out prizes like gift cards to restaurants and coffee shops. We also gave gift cards to a bookstore and some stores. It would be interesting to know if bigger prizes would help more. For example, we could have given away a bike or a new car. This might have helped people stay interested in the project. The prizes did not change much during the project. If we had announced bigger prizes in December and January, we might have gotten more people to participate.",
            "An ETF is a type of security.  It follows a group of things like an index or a basket of assets.  But it is more flexible and trades like a stock on a stock exchange.  An ETF gives you the safety of a group of investments and the benefits of owning one stock.  You can sell it short, buy with borrowed money, and buy a small amount.  These benefits are attractive.  But there are some problems.  You have to pay a fee to buy or sell an ETF, just like you do to buy a stock.  One good thing about ETFs is that there are many different kinds available.  But it is always a good idea to check if the benefits are real and how big they are.  In this effort, we will look at the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 holdings.  We want to see if owning one ETF is as good as owning 10 different stocks.  We will also see if there is a better way to put these stocks together for a better return.\n\nTo make this easier, we will only look at the top 10 stocks that make up 63.58% of the ETF.  These are the stocks that make the ETF valuable.  Below are the top 10 stocks and how much of the ETF they make up.\n\nTo see how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF, we can use a formula to calculate their Beta and return.  We will use the percentage of the ETF that each stock makes up.  The results are in the chart below.\n\nFrom the chart, we can see that a portfolio of just the top 10 stocks would be 6.11% higher than the ETF.  This is a 16% increase in returns.  We can also see that the Beta of the top 10 stocks is .12 lower than the ETF.  This means that the top 10 stocks could give a higher return with less risk.  But we need to know if these results are real or just a chance.\n\nTo be sure, we will look at how much each stock can change in value.  We will calculate the standard deviation of each stock and compare it to the ETF.  This will help us see if the two portfolios are really different.",
            "One of Edgar Allan Poe's famous poems is called \"Dream-Land.\" In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe uses a word called \"Thulé\" two times. This word comes from Virgil, a famous ancient writer. Virgil used this word to name a place north of Britain. Many people thought this place was the edge of the known world. Poe liked the work of German writers. \n\nPoe's use of \"Thulé\" is important. It shows Poe knew the work of a German writer named Goethe. Goethe wrote a famous play called \"Faust.\" It was published in two parts, the first part in 1808 and the second part in 1832, the year Goethe died. In the second part of \"Faust,\" there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem is about a king whose wife dies after giving him a special cup. After her death, the king drinks a lot and cries. He then decides it is time to die and leaves his possessions to his children. He throws the cup into the ocean and dies. Poe's poem \"Dream-Land\" and Goethe's \"The King of Thulé\" are similar. Maybe one is a dark version of the other. This could be because Poe was thinking about his own loss and his drinking. A man named H P Grattan wrote a play called \"Faust\" in 1842, a year before Poe used the word \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" Poe mentions Thule twice in his writings. He uses the phrase \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and \"Dream-Land\" twice as a book end. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be read as two connected poems. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker talks about a dark and lonely place called Thule. He sees a world without color and is haunted by dead friends. This is like the story of the king in \"The King of Thule,\" who has lost his wife and is lonely. Goethe was a famous writer that Poe would have known. Poe admired another writer, Tennyson, who liked Goethe's work. Poe would have seen Goethe's work in many books that were published after the original publication.",
            "Under California law, can a person who got hurt after slipping and falling on a spill in a grocery store get extra money as punishment from the store owner? The store owner was told twice about the spill, but he did not clean it up for 30 minutes because he was eating dinner.\n\nA judge is unlikely to quickly stop the case. To get extra money as punishment, the person who got hurt must show that the store owner acted on purpose to cause harm. The store owner must have known that not cleaning the spill could cause an injury. The person who got hurt will argue that the store owner should have known this because many people had slipped and fallen in the store in the past because of spills. The store owner still did not clean up the spill.\n\nThe person who got hurt will also argue that the store owner's actions were very bad. However, this argument is not very strong. But it may still be valid because many people had slipped and fallen in the store in 2009, and the store owner did not take steps to make the store safe.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, an employee of the grocery store told the manager about a spill in an aisle. The manager said he was on a break and could not deal with customer complaints. Another employee told the manager about the spill 15 minutes later, but he still did not clean it up. At 5:30 pm, the person who got hurt slipped and fell on the spill and got a serious back injury. Before this happened, five other people had slipped and fallen in the store in 2009. The person who got hurt is now suing the grocery store for money to cover her medical expenses and for extra money as punishment.\n\nIn California, a person can get extra money as punishment if the other person acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Malice is when someone acts on purpose to cause harm. It can also be when someone acts very badly and with a clear disregard for the safety of others. The court has said that this is the case when someone knows that their actions could cause harm and still does not try to stop it.",
            "I studied Islam in a class at CBC about four years ago.  We had a big discussion in class about whether Islam is a hostile religion.  I think this question is still important today.  I have seen how the media's view of Islam has changed since 9/11.  At first, they had a negative view.  Later, they became too friendly.  I don't think in 2001 we could have elected a president like Barack Obama, who comes from a family with Muslim background.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad is interesting to me.  But it does not match the history I know of Muhammad.  I thought he forced people to become Muslims.  But the biography says he was a kind and humble man.  People came to him because they believed in his teachings.  I also see some similarities between the work of Jesus and the miracles of Muhammad.  For example, Muhammad multiplied food so there was enough for many people.  I think the writers wanted to show Muhammad as a humble man who did not need to prove anything.  It makes me think they are trying to take credit for the life of Jesus.\n\nThere are many stories in the biography that sound like they are trying to prove that Muhammad was a good leader.  But these stories come from second-hand information.  I don't think this makes them more believable.  It makes me question the truth of the stories.  I don't like this because it makes the stories seem suspicious.\n\nWhat bothers me most is that the biography tries to make Muhammad seem like a kind and wise man.  But history says he was not like that.  I think Muslims today should know the real story of Muhammad's life.",
            "The teachings of Jesus and the ideas he believed in are not what many Christians follow today.  If we look at the history of Christianity, we see that it has moved away from its roots.  In the past, people did not think about this.  Today, however, there is a growing awareness that things have changed.  Many people are thinking about what Jesus really said and did.  They want to know the true meaning of his teachings.\n\nSoon, a new movement will start.  People will try to understand what Jesus really meant.  They will look at the ideas that were added to Christianity over time.  This will take a long time, but it will happen.  Christianity will go back to its original form.  People will understand the true meaning of Jesus' teachings.\n\nWhen this happens, Christianity will become more like it was when Jesus was alive.  People will focus on his ideas, not on the things that were added later.  The church as an organization will still be strong.  But the differences between Christians will fade away.  Instead of being different from each other, they will be more alike.\n\nHistory is full of examples of big changes.  One example is how the Roman Empire, which once persecuted Christians, became a Christian country.  Our country has also had big changes.  From slavery to freedom, from being against African-Americans to having an African-American president.\n\nA big change is coming in the Christian world.  People will start to see Jesus' words as symbols, not as exact statements.  This will help make the change happen.  To understand what I am saying, we need to look at the history of Christianity.  Before Jesus, there was only Judaism.  The Jewish people had many different ideas and groups.  They had Sadducees, Pharisees, and others.  They did not all agree on what was true.",
            "The Jungle shows how people are naturally selfish. They only think about themselves and want a good life. They do not care about others who are lower than them. The book shows this in many ways. The owners of big factories want to make their companies as big and successful as possible. They do not care about anything that gets in their way or gets hurt because of their success. They do not worry about the pollution their factories make. They also do not care about their workers. They want to make money, not help their employees. The owners force their workers to work long hours for little pay. They can fire many people at once without warning. At that time, there were no laws to protect workers. The owners had too much power.\n\nThe book shows that the workers were treated badly. They had no help or organizations to turn to. Some workers tried to form groups to help themselves, but these groups were not very helpful. The workers were treated so badly that they were almost like slaves. They were always hungry and had to work hard to survive. They depended on their bosses for everything.\n\nThe Jungle is a sad story about how people are treated in a big city. It shows that some people do not care about others and only want to make more money.",
            "Many authors use special ways to give readers a certain feeling. Some methods are more effective. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these methods in his novel The Great Gatsby. He pairs words together that do not usually fit to give a special feeling. He also uses symbols to give meaning. Fitzgerald uses many colors to give meaning to important things. He builds up the meaning of colors like white, gray, red, and pink. He uses these colors to remind readers of a feeling.\n\nFitzgerald makes white and gray mean the same thing - uniformity. White is nice and gray is old and faded. He uses these colors in the beginning of the novel. Many characters wear white. Daisy and Jordan wear white clothes. People at parties wear white. Even the streets are white. But Fitzgerald also uses these colors for ordinary things. He makes the city streets \"white chasms\" and the cars \"gray.\"\n\nLater, Fitzgerald uses white and gray to show that something is not important. He uses these colors to describe Daisy. He says she is wearing white and is like a uniform. This shows that Daisy is not a special person, but just something Gatsby wants. Fitzgerald uses this technique many times to show that Daisy is like a uniform.\n\nFitzgerald uses colors to remind readers of a feeling. He uses red and pink to show something is important. But that is a different story.",
            "San Diego County is a great place for growing food. The weather is mild and sunny. Many crops grow well here, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, and herbs. Many people in San Diego want organic food. They are willing to pay more for it. This is good news for farmers who use special methods that do not hurt the earth.\n\nSome farmers in San Diego give tours of their farms. People can visit and learn about the farms. They can also walk and look for birds. This helps the farmers get money and help the environment.\n\nOrganic farming has many benefits. It helps plants and animals live in the area. But it is harder and more expensive than other ways of farming. Farmers must work harder to get rid of pests and weeds. They also need to put special food on the soil to help it grow.\n\nThe land I am talking about is near the town of Potrero. It is 160 acres of land with different kinds of plants and trees. Many animals live there, including some that are in danger. The government has a plan to protect them. The plan includes over 100 kinds of plants and animals. Some are endangered, like the kangaroo rat and the California gnatcatcher.\n\nPeople lived in this area a long time ago. Then, ranchers and loggers came. They used the land for many years. Now, a farmer could use the land for organic farming. I looked at a government program to see how a farmer could get help. I also looked at a real farm in the area to see what they do.",
            "Culture is a very important part of any negotiation. But culture is not the same as what it might seem to be. It is not a single thing. It is not the same everywhere. We should not say that all Russians are stubborn or that all Japanese people are accommodating. This is not true. Understanding a culture is not just about what it is, but also what it means. Knowing about a culture can help us understand how it will affect a negotiation.\n\nWhen we meet people from another culture, we think of them in relation to our own culture. This can lead to comparisons. To understand another culture, we can learn about its history or its customs. We should not try to change another culture, but accept it for what it is. This is especially true in negotiations, especially if we have less strength or power.\n\nCulture does not only exist between countries. Companies also have their own culture. For example, some companies value hard work and long hours, while others value relaxation and freedom. We can see this in the way employees dress, how they communicate, and how they are hired. Even within the same country, different companies can have different cultures. This shows that cultures are not always what they seem.\n\nValues are even more important to understand. They tell us why a culture behaves in a certain way. If a culture values saving face or harmony, a negotiator will not publicly disagree or argue. If a culture values hard work, a negotiator will not settle easily. Understanding these values can help us prepare for a negotiation. But it is also important to learn about our opponent and their needs to make a successful negotiation.",
            "Two famous thinkers, St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas, each wrote about the existence of God. We will look at their ideas and see if one is better than the other. We will assume they are both correct about the Christian God.\n\nTo compare their ideas, we will first look at St. Anselm's argument. He says we can find God in our own minds. He believes that because we think about God, God must exist. St. Anselm thinks we don't need to look outside ourselves for proof of God's existence. He says this is an example of faith.\n\nThomas Aquinas has a different idea. He thinks we can prove God exists using reason and what we see in the world. He does not need faith. Aquinas gives five reasons why God exists. He says that change, cause, chance, and order in the world all need a creator. He is saying that God must exist because the world is not perfect and has problems that need a solution.\n\nWe can see that their ideas are different. St. Anselm believes in faith, while Thomas Aquinas believes in reason. We will continue to look at their ideas to see if one is better than the other.",
            "A long time ago, in the fifth or sixth century, a prince was born. He would later be called Buddha. This man lived a long life and became very wise. He gave up the world and found enlightenment. His teachings started Buddhism, a very old religion. It is now 2,500 years old. Today, it is different from what it was when Buddha was alive. This change can be seen in many countries, like Sri Lanka. In Sri Lanka, people celebrate the water-cutting ceremony every year. Monks and normal people take part in this ceremony. It has some importance, but Buddha never taught about a celebration like this. Changes like this happen in the Theravada Buddhist community. They occur in both the monastery and the community of regular people. These changes happen because of internal and external forces.\n\nInternal forces come from people who follow the Buddha's teachings. External forces come from people who do not follow Buddhism. A hostile force is something that hurts the Buddhist community. A benign force is something that helps or does not hurt the community.\n\nLet us look at the basics of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists trust in three things: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is the Buddhist teachings. They are found in the Tripitaka - three baskets of text. The Sutta Pitaka has the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka has the rules for living, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka has the ideas about the world. These ideas are Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (suffering in life), and Anicca (nothing is permanent). Understanding these ideas can end the cycle of death and rebirth, called Sansara. Sansara is a cycle of suffering, desire, hatred, and delusion. When one becomes enlightened, these things go away.\n\nThe Vinaya Pitaka has rules for living. For non-monks, there are five rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not misbehave, and do not take alcohol. Monks have many more rules. The most important idea in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths. First, life has suffering. Second, attachment causes suffering. Third, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico had a long rivalry from 1836 to 1893. This lasted for 57 years. The worst time of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848. The United States won and got new land from Mexico. This included Texas and the American Southwest. The two countries had many problems, but the rivalry finally stopped before the First World War.\n\nThis is not unusual. Countries that share a border often have disagreements. These disagreements can lead to long-lasting rivalries. The United States and Mexico are an example of this. Many countries near the United States have good relations with it. However, Mexico and Cuba have had problems with the United States for a long time.\n\nOne problem between the two countries was religion. Many people in the United States did not like Catholicism. This was a major issue between the two countries. In the past, the United States and the Soviet Union had a rivalry based on politics. But the United States and Mexico had a rivalry based on religion. This was a problem because of the distrust between the English and Spanish.\n\nDiehl and Goerts wrote about 17 problems between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry. Most of these problems were about border issues. These issues included border raids from Mexican territory into the United States. The United States and Mexico finally stopped these problems when they used force to control their borders.\n\nThe rivalry between the two countries started to end when Mexico became dependent on the United States. The United States then changed its goals from expanding its territory to helping Mexico economically.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I got very sick with an illness I did not know about. I was 46 years old and a nurse. I chose to be a nurse because people always told me, \"You can find a job easily because people will always get sick.\" My dream was to be a scientist or a journalist, but I chose nursing instead.\n\nNow, I am disabled. I have been getting money from the government for 15 years, but I have nothing left. Every day is hard for me. I am lucky to have my family and some good friends who help me. When disaster happens, it is hard to feel strong.\n\nMy point is that bad things can happen in life. We cannot always prepare for them and need help from others. I agree that the government is not always reliable. But I think it is better for Americans to help each other and ask for help instead of trying to do everything alone.\n\nSome people say that America was built on individualism. But the pioneers who came to America a long time ago did not make it by themselves. They needed each other's help. So, be prepared for disasters. I have a kit with food, water, and other important things in case of an emergency. But it is also important to know your neighbors and help them.",
            "Why do living things change over time? Are there limits that influence how they change? In 1917, D'Arcy Thompson said that it is hard to explain even simple living things with math. Today, we still face this problem. Recently, scientists have used math to study how some animals grow and develop over time. Our study is exploring how math can help us understand how living things change over time.\n\nWe are studying the shell of a certain type of animal called Prunum. We want to know how it changes over time and how it has changed in the past. We used special pictures taken with X-rays to measure the shell's shape. We then used a computer program to create models of what the shell might have looked like in the past. These models help us understand how living things can change.\n\nA shell is like a tube that grows over time. It makes a spiral shape, with each part of the shell growing around a center point. This center point is called the columella. The shell grows in rounds, called whorls. Each whorl is connected by a line, called a suture. The last whorl is the biggest. The shell has a top and a bottom, a point called the apex and a base. The animal lives in its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nWe can look at a shell from different angles. There are four main views: from the top, from the bottom, from the side, and from the front. The front view is the usual way to look at a shell.\n\nTo count the whorls, we look at the shell from the top. We draw a line where the first connection between whorls starts. Then, we count the whorls from that line. We can only count a whole number of whorls. If a whorl is half done, we count it as half.\n\nA shell is like a path that the animal follows as it grows. We can use math to trace this path. We can then change the math to see how the animal's growth might have been different. This helps us understand how living things change over time.",
            "Indonesia's rates of baby and young child deaths have not changed much in the last ten years.  The country is almost on track to meet some of the goals from the Millennium Development Plan, like improving water and sanitation.  However, progress in health care for mothers and babies is slow.  This means Indonesia will likely not meet its goals by 2015.  There are many reasons for this.  We will talk about them below.\n\nOne good thing is that more babies are born with a trained health worker present.  Now, 72% of births have a trained worker.  But, even though this is an improvement, it is not as good as it sounds.  Many of these trained workers are midwives who cannot help in case of a problem.  This is why many mothers die from heavy bleeding.  There is still much work to do.\n\nFewer children are treated by a health worker when they have diarrhea.  We do not have complete information about care for new mothers after birth.  However, it is clear that this is a problem.  Few mothers and babies get the care they need.\n\nFew women have a cesarean section.  This is a problem.  The rate of cesarean sections is 7% in cities, but only 2% in rural areas.  This means that cities have better access to healthcare than rural areas.  This is unfair.\n\nAnother problem is that people with less money have a hard time getting healthcare.  In fact, there is a 27% difference in healthcare use between the richest and the poorest people in the country.  The poor cannot afford healthcare because they have to pay out of their own pocket.\n\nNow, we must think about how to improve healthcare for mothers and babies.  The main question is how to make healthcare services more available.  Should we make programs to help mothers and babies, or should we make the healthcare system better in general?  There are pros and cons to each approach.  Program-specific approaches are attractive because they are clear and can give quick results.  However, this can lead to problems.  When we spend a lot of money on one area, it can leave other areas without enough money.  Also, many programs can cause confusion and extra work for the healthcare system.",
            "Victorian novels are noted for their detailed descriptions and focus on the rich people of that time. Two famous novels that are different from this type are \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights\". These novels often use mystery and strange events to help readers understand the characters. This makes the characters more interesting and adds depth to their thoughts and feelings.\n\nIn \"Oliver Twist\", the main character has many strange and confusing thoughts. He is still seeing two men, Sikes and Crackit, arguing. The words they say are still in his mind. When he pays attention, he finds that he is talking to them. Suddenly, he hears the sound of guns and there are loud cries and shouts. He feels pain and is moved quickly away. He sees many strange things, but he is not in control.\n\nIn \"Oliver Twist\", the author uses strange events, like dreams, to show what is happening inside the main character's mind. In one scene, Oliver remembers a violent event that happened to him. He relives it as if it is happening again. He is very scared and in pain. He does not understand what is happening to him. The author wants the reader to see that Oliver has no control over his life. He is not in charge of what happens to him. The author wants the reader to feel sorry for Oliver.\n\nIn another scene, the main character says that time is passing quickly. A day comes and goes, and then night comes again. But it is not a normal day and night. The day is short and the night is long. The main character is very unhappy. He is in a difficult situation and it is hard for him to feel safe.",
            "A few years ago, I worked in an after-school program that helped elementary school students. I tried my best to help them in their difficult subjects, but I was good at English and reading. My boss asked me to help a boy named Adrian. He was in third or fourth grade and had trouble reading. I saw that something was strange. He knew some letters, but others he did not understand. He spoke good English, but his mother did not speak English. She spoke Spanish.\n\nOne day, I took care of him while his classmates went on a trip. His mother came in and we talked in Spanish, but I did not know much Spanish. I then understood that Adrian could read, but did not know the English alphabet. I hope he is doing better now.\n\nI tell this story to show that a language problem exists in schools, especially in California. Even if a child speaks good English, reading can be hard. I think everyone agrees that this is a problem. The solution for Adrian was simple: tutoring in English reading. But for children who do not speak much English, the problem is more complicated.\n\nThere is no one answer. We need to use many things together. We can use the dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, and ESL classes. But we must use them all together. \n\nThe dual language system is a good idea. It helps all children, not just those who speak Spanish. Children in this kind of program do better in school. Many people are afraid of this idea, thinking it is a waste of money and that most children will not benefit. But this is not true. If we use this system in all schools, all children will benefit.\n\nBut how do we do this? Do we need all teachers to be bilingual? No, that is not possible. We can have special helpers who are bilingual. They can assist teachers and students. This is a good idea.",
            "When we are young, people often tell us that there is something bigger than we are. This is something we cannot understand. Some people go to church to learn about it. Others go to the temple or look inside themselves for answers. Many people accept the religion their parents teach them. But some people do not believe in it. They think there is nothing beyond what they know. They may accept one idea and then change their mind and accept another. We search for meaning in life through our own ideas about spirituality.\n\nI asked my father about his favorite bird. It was a cardinal. We sat on our porch, listening to the rain. He looked out into the rain, thinking about something. He had lost weight and his hair was thinning. He did not look at me. I felt sad, scared, and could not talk to him about how much I would miss him. I hugged him and we sat together in the rain.\n\nMy father died in December, a few days after my twenty-second birthday. The medicine and radiation did not help him. They kept him alive a little longer. I wanted to remember my father when he was alive, not how he died. I did not want to see him go away. I wanted to remember him as he was, not how he suffered. I thought, \"What kind of God would do this?\" I did not pray to God that night. If God exists, I thought, he is not listening to me.\n\nI did not want to watch my father die. I wanted to remember him, not how he died. I knew my father better than anyone. I knew he would not want me to watch him die. So I stayed in bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one called me.",
            "The Gothic Novel is an interesting mix of old and new. This is exactly how writer Ian Watt describes it. The Gothic style has been both praised and criticized. Some people say it is shallow, while others say it evokes a feeling of the 'terrible sublime' (Burke). The first Gothic Novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, combined old and new ideas to create a new way to write stories. Walpole used old theatrical elements and new ideas to create what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic style uses ideas from medieval theater, architecture, and traditions. Even when The Castle of Otranto was first published, the word \"gothic\" was used to describe many things. Some people thought it was old-fashioned or not sophisticated.\n\nThe combination of the old and new ideas in Gothic novels is what makes them interesting. This is because the old ideas are presented in a new way, allowing readers to see the characters' feelings and thoughts more clearly. This is why Gothic novels have been popular for a long time, even though they were written a long time ago.\n\nOne important idea in Gothic novels is the concept of chivalry. Chivalry was a way to train knights in the Middle Ages. It meant being brave, honorable, and competent. Many Gothic writers, including Walpole, liked chivalry because it represented a high ideal. They thought that people in their time did not live up to this ideal. They used chivalric ideas and manners to make the past seem romantic and ideal. This is because Walpole and others wanted to show that people in the past were better than those in the present.\n\nWalpole wrote The Castle of Otranto during a difficult time in history. He was worried about the future and thought that people had lost the good qualities of the past. This is why he wrote about characters like Frederic, who was a prince and a brave and courteous knight. Frederic's description includes many traditional chivalric images. He has suffered a great deal and is now supposed to be dead. But he is actually alive and will return to fight for what is right. The idea of the gallant and courteous knight is an important part of the Gothic style.",
            "The supply chain is a series of actions that helps move goods from the customer's order to the final product. It includes getting raw materials, making the product, and delivering it to the customer. The term supply chain management was created in 1982 by a consultant named Keith Oliver. He explained how to plan and control the supply chain to meet customer needs quickly and efficiently.\n\nThere are six important parts of a supply chain: making the product, getting the materials, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these parts to give the best service to customers.\n\nFirst, making the product is the start of the supply chain. Making the product is the base for the whole supply chain. The making stage answers the questions of when, why, where, and how things are made. Before making the product, managers must know what customers want. They look at the market to see what customers need. The market shows what customers are asking for.\n\nAfter studying the market, managers decide what products to make and how many. Then they decide where to make the products and which factory will make the right amount of products for the customers. Managers also decide how to schedule work and take care of the machines. Making the product is very important in the supply chain. Every detail is crucial. If managers do not plan carefully, it can take a long time and cost a lot of money.\n\nFor example, I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target. Both companies have a plan for each part of the business. There is a plan for how employees dress and how goods are received from trucks. Having a plan helps the company work smoothly and avoid confusion.\n\nThe second important part of the supply chain is getting the materials. Getting the materials means making decisions about the company's strengths and weaknesses. A company may have many different departments that make different parts of a product. The manager decides which department is best for each part. The manager may also decide to ask another company to help make the product. This is called outsourcing. The main reason for outsourcing is to make the product quickly and with good quality while keeping costs low.",
            "A sign on a street in Burma, also known as Myanmar, says Hitler is alive. Ellen Page, a famous actress, holds a cardboard sign with this message. Burma is a country in Southeast Asia. It is ruled by a group of military leaders who took control in 1962. In 2007, people protested in the streets. These protests were called the Saffron Revolution. Many Buddhist monks led the protests. They wore yellow robes. The government allowed the monks to protest at first, but then violence increased. The military attacked the monasteries. They arrested and imprisoned journalists. A Japanese journalist was killed in 2007. The government says 13 people were killed, but a former army officer claims many more were killed.\n\nThis is not new. Governments have wanted to control their people for a long time. In ancient Rome, leaders thought they were chosen by gods. Japanese leaders think they are gods. Our current president has meetings with a man who says he represents a group called Stupid People Worldwide.\n\nThere are many examples of governments hurting their people. In 1989, people protested in China's Tiananmen Square. Many were killed. The number of deaths is not known. In Rwanda, a group of people killed others because of their tribe. Many people were hurt or killed. In Germany, a man named Hitler hurt many people because of their religion.",
            "Duke Ellington's place in jazz comes from his long life and his ability to make his orchestra strong. Ellington did not often play the piano in his songs, but as a composer, he wrote great music that showed how well his band members could play. He made a framework where musicians could improvise and also wrote music that used the special sound of each musician. This made his songs sound new and original.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary says Ellington's sound was special because he used the voice as an instrument. This is seen in Creole Love Call, a song he made early in his career. In this song, Ellington uses the voice to add color and texture without words. He also uses the voice to fit with the style of each musician. This song is a slow blues with six parts. Each part is different. \n\n- Part 1: A call and response between voice and wind instruments. The voice starts smooth, then gets rougher.\n- Part 2: A muted trumpet solo that makes the basic melody sound longer and uses some extra notes.\n- Part 3: A clarinet solo that sounds high and is backed by a piano that plays in a special rhythm.\n- Part 4: The whole band plays a call and response, just like in part 1, but with brass and wind instruments.\n- Part 5: The most exciting part of the song, where the wind instruments call and respond in a high sound, and the brass and rhythm instruments play in a special way.\n- Part 6: The song goes back to the start, with call and response between voice and wind instruments. This time, the voice sounds like a special instrument.\n\nEllington used the voice to make his songs sound new and interesting. In Hot and Bothered, he combined his good orchestration with his ear for sound. He used a call and response between a trumpeter and a singer to make a rich and special sound. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) shows how well he used a trombone player to introduce the melody.\n\nEllington's use of the voice in his songs is one way he made jazz special. He made his musicians sound good and created new and interesting music.",
            "She felt something was missing in her life. This feeling did not go away. It started when she was 14 years old. It was still there three years later, when she was 17. She wanted a person, not just a thing. But she did not like any boys. Some boys liked her. They tried to talk to her, but she did not like them. She often thought about why this was happening to her.\n\nShe lived at home with her parents. They were kind and calm. They rarely argued with each other. They argued with her only about her independence. She was different from her parents. She was outgoing and fun, and everyone liked her.\n\nToday was not a calm day. She heard a loud sound from the kitchen. She ran to the room and saw her mother on the floor. Her mother was in pain and saying \"Ow\" many times. Her daughter ran to her and put her hand on her. \"Mom, what's wrong?!\" she asked. Her mother said, \"Ow... sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital.\" Her daughter helped her mother to the car and drove her to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital had a bad smell.

            "This study had one purpose. It was to show that eating a Mediterranean-style diet, called the Med diet, can help prevent heart disease and stroke. We found that women who ate this type of food had a lower risk of these diseases.\n\nThe Med diet is a special way of eating. It includes more plant foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes. It also includes fish and less animal products and fatty foods. Drinking some alcohol in moderation is okay.\n\nBefore this study, other studies had shown that eating a Med diet can help lower the risk of dying from any cause and from heart disease. But they did not look at the risk of stroke or dying from a stroke.\n\nWe studied 74,886 women between the ages of 38 and 63 who were not sick with heart disease or diabetes. They were all part of a big study of nurses in 11 US states. We asked them to tell us about what they ate over the past year six times between 1984 and 2004. More than 95% of the women kept participating for 20 years.\n\nWe used questionnaires to ask about what they ate. We also checked to make sure the information was correct. We looked at the women's medical records to see if they got sick with heart disease, died from heart disease, or had a stroke. If we did not have the records, we considered it a possible case and included it in our study.\n\nWe also looked at other things like how much they weighed, if they smoked, if they took aspirin, if they took vitamins, and if they exercised. We took the average of what they ate over the past two years to get a better idea of their long-term eating habits. We controlled for things that could affect the results, like age, smoking, weight, menopause, and exercise.\n\nWe used a special method to see if eating a Med diet was linked to heart disease and stroke. We looked at the women who ate the most Med-style food and compared them to those who ate the least. We found that women who ate more Med-style food had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\nOver 20 years, we found 2391 cases of heart disease, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 deaths from heart disease and stroke. Women who ate the most Med-style food were less likely to get heart disease or stroke than women who ate the least. Their risk was 29% lower.",
            "In 2007, the United States had a big financial problem. Many people lost their jobs, and the value of homes dropped. The government and big companies were in trouble. We must ask: how did this happen? And how can we stop it? In short, the financial problem was caused by bad choices made by politicians. They forced banks to give money to people who could not pay it back. The banks also sold these loans to other companies, which created a big problem.\n\nThe financial crisis started in 1999. President Clinton wanted to be president again. He wanted to be popular, so he made it easier for people to get loans. This created a big problem for the future. A writer from the New York Times, Steven Holmes, wrote about this in 1999. He said Fannie Mae, a company that gives loans, was under pressure to give loans to people who could not afford them. He also said this could cause a problem in the future.\n\nMany things combined to make the economy worse. New types of loans were made, like loans with rates that could change. These loans made it easy for people to borrow money, but it also made them very vulnerable. When the housing market dropped, many people lost a lot of money. The top five investment banks in the US had $4.1 trillion dollars of debt in 2007. This was a big problem. Some banks were sold or shut down, and others were forced to change.\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two big companies that help people get loans, had $5 trillion dollars of debt. They were put under government control in 2008. This financial crisis was a big problem that affected many people.",
            "Exposition is a part of your story where you tell the reader important information. But it can also be boring. Dr. Merlin says she sometimes gets frustrated when she writes too much and her readers lose interest.\n\nYou probably know the writing tip \"Show, don't tell.\" But Dr. Merlin still makes mistakes and writes too much exposition. This is when you tell the reader too much information at once. It can be like a character dumping too much information on another character.\n\nExposition is like a big speech. The author is telling the reader what to know. In stories, this can be when one character talks a lot about something. In film, it's when someone talks a lot to another character.\n\nLet's look at an example. A story might say, \"The heroine met her husband at a place and time. They got married in a big ceremony. He was murdered in front of her.\" But if the story spends two pages on this, with only a few lines of dialogue, it's boring. You want to know more about the husband and why he's important to the heroine.\n\nYou should show the reader how much the husband loves his wife and how she feels about him. Maybe he says something kind or does something special. Maybe she thinks about him often or feels sad when he's not there. This helps the reader connect with the story and care about what happens.\n\nIn short, you need to add details to the story. You can't just say, \"They met, they married, he died.\" You need to show the reader why this is important. \n\nSometimes it's hard to resist telling too much. Maybe you're introducing a new character and you want to tell everything about him. But try to show it instead. For example, you might say, \"He used to be in the Air Force and now he works at a gas station. He likes fishing and dreams of owning the station one day.\" This is better than saying, \"He was in the Air Force, now he works at a gas station, he's been married twice, no kids, likes to fish, and wants to own the station.\"",
            "I watched two news programs from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was live from NBC 4 on August 13, 2011. The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio. He stabbed his wife. The police arrested him. His name was Shad Hostettler. The news showed his picture. He looked very bad. They talked about this story for two minutes. I think they said enough.\n\nThe next story was about a man named Travis Buyers, 18 years old. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area. He was very sick. The police did not know who shot him. They were investigating. This story was short. I think it was because the man was black. I have seen this before. When a white person is a victim of a crime, the news talks a lot. But when a black person is a victim, the news talks less.\n\nThe next story was about a helicopter that was shot. It was a Med-Flight helicopter. The police think it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. They want people to help find the person who shot the helicopter. They are offering a reward of $5,000.\n\nThe news also talked about the weather. They said it would rain and be hot on Saturday afternoon. The temperature would be in the mid to low eighties all weekend. They wanted to keep people watching.\n\nAnother story was about a robbery at a store in Columbus. A black man robbed the store. He was wearing a hoodie and was about 6 feet tall and 150 pounds. The news talked a lot about how black he was.\n\nThe last story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez. He was a big drug dealer from Texas. He was caught for selling a lot of marijuana in Ohio. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison. The news said he would be in prison for 300 months. They also said he was Hispanic. I don't think that was important to the story.",
            "There is a strong connection between brothers. This connection can be very good or very bad. It is made up of many feelings: love, pride, jealousy, and anger. Brothers know each other very well. They can see themselves in each other. When brothers are very sad or in big trouble, their true feelings are shown. These feelings can have big costs. To understand brothers, you must understand the problems that come with their feelings. When you can look at a brother and see yourself, you see yourself in a real way.\n\nIn a story called \"The Scarlet Ibis\", two brothers deal with these feelings. They go on a hard journey in a beautiful place. They are very disappointed and very proud at the same time. Only one brother survives. The story shows how one brother feels through how he acts and what he does. The narrator also tells us how the brother feels and what he sees in the world around him. This helps us understand why he does the things he does.\n\nThe big feeling that drives the brother is pride. From the time he and his little brother Doodle go out together, the brother feels angry at Doodle. He wanted a brother who could do things with him, like running and climbing trees. But Doodle was sick and could not do these things. This was hard for the brother to accept. He even thought about hurting Doodle. But when Doodle smiled, the brother's anger went away. This shows that the brother truly loved his brother.",
            "The human brain is a very complex system. It helps us think and remember. A long time ago, people thought of the brain like a clay tablet. Then they thought of it like a piece of paper. Next, it was like a book. Now, some people think of it like a computer. These ideas are not perfect. They can lead to mistakes.\n\nInformation gets into the brain from our senses. Our senses include our eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin. They turn things like touch, heat, and light into electrical signals. The brain uses these signals to understand the world.\n\nThe brain works in two ways. Bottom-up means breaking down information into small parts. Top-down means using what we already know to help us understand. For example, when you see a picture of a black box, the brain first looks at the colors and edges. Then it uses what it knows about boxes to decide what it is.\n\nThe brain also has a filter. It decides what information is important and what we should pay attention to. We might see many things, but we only pay attention to some of them. Our brain can pick out our name in a loud room, but we might not notice every small thing around us.\n\nThe brain needs a place to store information. It has three kinds of memory: sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is stored. There are different ways to store different kinds of information. For example, our brains store words in different ways, like how they look, how they sound, and what they mean.\n\nInformation is not just stored, it must also be kept safe. Some studies on animals show that the brain keeps information in working memory for about 20 seconds by sending an electrical signal through a group of brain cells. Long-term memory is thought to be stored in the shape of certain kinds of proteins.\n\nThere are many ways to think about how the brain stores knowledge. Some come from people's memories, some from computers, and some from studying how the brain works. One idea is that the brain is like a network of connected ideas. For example, if we think of a chair, we might also think of a table, which we might think of as made of wood.",
            "Aldous Huxley is worried about the future. He writes a book called Brave New World to show how people might live in a world controlled by technology and capitalism. In this world, people care more about being happy now than about being an individual. From a young age, they are taught to be happy and not to think deeply. The people in this world are not really in charge. They are controlled by the World Controller. \n\nWe can see that Huxley does not like this kind of society. He uses ideas from Marxism to show his worries. Marxism is a way of thinking about how societies work. Huxley uses words from Marxism, like \"homogeny\" and \"reification\", to show that he is worried about the way people live in his world. \n\nIn Brave New World, people do not know about the real world. They are too busy looking after themselves. They are not allowed to think about their place in society. They are happy to buy things and enjoy themselves. The people in charge, the Alphas and Betas, do not care about fairness. They are happy to take what they want. \n\nIn Brave New World, people do not love each other. They do not feel strong emotions. They just want to be happy. They talk about each other's bodies, not their feelings. This shows that Huxley thinks that technology and capitalism are taking away people's freedom to feel and think deeply. \n\nThe people in Brave New World are happy to obey the rules. They do not want to change the way things are. This is like what Marx said about the proletariat, the working class. They are fooled into thinking they are better than others as long as they keep buying and following the rules.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for about two and a half years. Getting around campus can be difficult. My freshman year, I lived in East Halls dorm, which is far from the center of campus. It took me 25 minutes to walk to classes in the Willard building on bad days. The weather in State College can be bad.\n\nI talked to an old friend who rides a bike. He said it is the best way to get around campus. Bicycling is good for your body and is the most efficient way to travel. You can eat a bowl of oatmeal and ride your bike 30 miles or more. I now live off campus, far from the center of campus. I bought a bike this year, and it was a good decision. My classes are in the Thomas building, which is 25 minutes away on foot. But on a bike, it takes only 5 minutes. The road I take, Pollock Road, is not always easy to ride on.\n\nWalking is also a good option, but I am too busy to walk. If I didn't have a bike, I would have to walk to Thomas building every day. That would take 30-40 minutes. That is 2.5 hours every week. I don't have that much time."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "I want to get a degree in social work. This will help me have a good career with the Division of Family and Children Services. My goal is to help children who are abused or neglected, and help troubled families.\n\nImportant values I can bring to social work are: helping others, respecting people, being honest, and working hard to be good at my job. These values are not just important for social workers. They are also important for me as a person.\n\nI have always wanted to help others. But I was not sure what career I wanted. In high school and college, I saw many people ignore their problems and deal with them in not-so-good ways. I got a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College in 2009. After I graduated, I was still not sure what I wanted to do.\n\nOne day, a friend showed me a sixteen-year-old boy who was very nervous. He was visiting because his parents were being mean to him. The next day, I learned he had called the police. I went to his parents' house to see if I could help. I told the police I had a degree in Psychology and asked if I could talk to the parents. They were nervous and said their son was being manipulative. This made me think I wanted to help children with problems like this.\n\nAnother important value for social work is fairness. We say that every person is important. But we also try to be like everyone else. I like to be different. I like to express myself through my hair, clothes, and body. I also want to be fair to everyone. In high school and college, I tried to fight for what is right. I wore colorful hair, earrings, and declared my support for the GSBA. I also fought against racism and other types of unfairness. I will continue to fight for what is right.",
            "This report is about two models related to insomnia. The biological model looks at genetics and health problems. The sociocultural model looks at how the environment affects people. This report will examine these models and explain some research about insomnia.\n\nInsomnia is a sleep problem. It can be caused by a medical condition, a mental health problem, or another issue. There are different kinds of sleep disorders. Some are problems with falling asleep or staying asleep. Others are caused by mental health problems.\n\nThe biological model of sleep problems looks at genetics and health. Some research suggests that certain genes can affect sleep. This study looked at mice and found that a special group of cells in the brain helps people sleep and wake up. When these cells are working correctly, people sleep well. If they are not working correctly, people may have trouble sleeping. This study also found that a medicine called baclofen can help people sleep. This means that genetics and the environment can affect how well people sleep.\n\nThe sociocultural model looks at how the environment affects people. If someone has insomnia, it can be because of their genetics. This means that they may be more likely to have trouble sleeping. This can affect their daily life and make it hard for them to focus and do things.\n\nThe biological model of sleep problems focuses on genes and health. Research has shown that certain genes can affect sleep. For example, a study found that a special group of cells in the brain helps people sleep and wake up. When these cells are working correctly, people sleep well. If they are not working correctly, people may have trouble sleeping.\n\nThe sociocultural model of sleep problems looks at how the environment affects people.

            "This paper is about Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD. We will look at the definition, diagnosis, and how a teacher can help a student with CAPD in a classroom.\n\nFirst, let us look at what CAPD is. CAPD is a problem with how the brain uses the information we hear. It is not a problem with hearing itself, but with how our brain understands what we hear. People with CAPD can hear sounds, but they have trouble understanding them. They may have trouble hearing in noisy places or understanding what people say when there is background noise.\n\nThe idea of CAPD was first talked about in the 1950s as \"auditory imperception\". Researchers were looking at children with communication problems. They started testing children in 1954, and in 1961, they developed a way to test how people hear sounds at the same time.\n\nCAPD can make it hard for people to do many things. They may have trouble finding where a sound is coming from, or understanding two sounds happening at the same time. They may have trouble recognizing patterns or understanding changes in voice. Sometimes, one sound can block out another sound. They may also have trouble putting together clues they hear to understand what is happening.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, doctors and other experts use tests. They watch how people react to sounds and use special tests to see how well they can hear. These tests may ask people to do things like listen to many sounds and choose the right one. There is no one test that works well for everyone, and we do not know what causes CAPD.\n\nTeachers can help students with CAPD in a classroom. They can help by giving them extra time to listen and pay attention. They can also help by reducing background noise and using visual aids to help the student understand what is being said. This can help the student learn and succeed in school.",
            "The play Twelfth Night says that disguise can be useful for tricking people. But it can also cause big problems. If you hide who you are, you may lose yourself. The play says you must choose between saving yourself or the relationships you have with others.\n\nThe play is about gender role reversal. This means men and women change places. This is a problem because it raises many questions. Why do people want to change their roles? In the play, a woman named Viola wants to be a man to protect herself. She is afraid of being hurt. Viola's plan works, but it also hurts her relationships with other women.\n\nViola is so good at acting like a man that a woman named Olivia falls in love with her. Olivia thinks Viola is a man named Sebastian. Viola also has feelings for a man named Orsino. But Orsino does not love Viola. He thinks she is a boy named Cesario. This is confusing and difficult for Viola.\n\nThe play may show that hiding who you are can help you understand your true feelings. Olivia and Orsino may have feelings they are hiding. But the play is not sure if this is true. It may be a way to make fun of people who judge others based on how they look. This is because Olivia easily falls in love with one man and then another. She seems to care more about her friends than her romantic feelings.\n\nThe play ends with Viola's true identity being discovered. Olivia says to Viola, \"You are my sister.\" This means Olivia accepts Viola as a person and not as a man or a boy. The play says that being true to yourself is important, even if it is hard.",
            "Many people note that German rule was very cruel, especially in German South West Africa. The German government killed many Ovaherero and Nama people. But this is not all that happened in the German colonies. The German colonies were different from each other in many ways. The German government spent more money on education in some places than in others. In East Africa, the British found many educated Africans when they took over in 1919. German education in Kamerun and other colonies was also good. \n\nBut in South West Africa, the story was different. The government did not help much with African education. Missionary groups did most of the work, but they did not have much money. The government, however, spent a lot on education for Europeans in South West Africa. This had a big effect on the colony even after German rule ended. In South West Africa, many people were still uneducated and illiterate. Other German colonies had many well-educated Africans. What made South West Africa different? This paper looks at the reasons why. It also looks at how German settlers and government officials thought about African people.\n\nThere is a lot of writing about education in the German colonies. Most of these writings were in German and were written long ago. They mostly described the education systems in different colonies. Later, some people wrote about the differences between the colonies and how education worked in each one. One writer, Cohen, compared education in South West Africa and East Africa. He said the number of European settlers in South West Africa was a big reason for the differences in education there.\n\nSouth West Africa was a good place for Europeans to live, with a mild climate and not too much desert. This is why many Europeans lived there. By 1913, 15,000 Europeans lived in South West Africa. In other parts of the German colonies, like East Africa, there were only 5,300 Europeans.",
            "Heavy Metal music has changed much over the last 100 years. Today, it is hard to list all the different types of music that fall under this name. Many of these types, like rock, country, and jazz, have their own smaller groups, or sub-types. Heavy Metal is a special kind of music that started 40 years ago. It is expressive and diverse. It shows a wide range of feelings, mostly sad or unhappy ones. People who make this music like to experiment and try new things. This has led to many new types of Metal music.\n\nIt is difficult to say what is really Heavy Metal today. This music has taken ideas from other kinds of music, but it started from somewhere. To understand Metal music, we need to know what it is and why it exists as a movement.\n\nMetal music is often about darkness. It is a type of music that is louder, more violent, and more exciting. People who make Metal music are good at playing their instruments. Metal music often comes from people who have taken drugs. In the 1970s, people used drugs and made music that was strange and new. This music was about the darker side of life. Later, people who made Metal music took inspiration from old music that was also about darkness. Some songs express this dark feeling, like the song \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles. This song was one of the first Heavy Metal songs and shows how music can be both sad and exciting.",
            "Henri Rousseau was an artist. Before the Surrealist artists painted dreamlike works, he was making his own dreams come true. His painting, The Dream, created in 1910, shows a woman who is in awe of the beautiful things she sees in a dream. It also shows Rousseau's own dreams and goals as an artist.\n\nRousseau wanted to be accepted by other artists and art lovers. But he had a problem. He wanted to be different and original, but he also wanted to be accepted by the art world. This was a big decision for him. He had to choose between being different and being accepted.\n\nTo understand Rousseau's painting, The Dream, we need to know a little about his life. He was born in 1844 in a town in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith. He did not go to art school, but he worked as a customs inspector. When his first wife died, he had a lot of sadness. He started painting to feel better.\n\nRousseau wanted to be a famous artist, but he did not start painting until he was an old man. Many other artists were already famous when he began. But he did not give up. He kept painting and finally got the recognition he wanted.\n\nThe art writer Jan Gordon said that Rousseau and another famous artist, Matisse, were different. Matisse did not want to paint in a simple way. Rousseau wanted to paint in a way that was simple and traditional so that people would accept him as an artist.",
            "Many smart people have said that there is a strong link between what is right and what is beautiful. I agree with them. Our brains immediately know that something is right or wrong, and we also know what is beautiful or ugly. One reason for this is because we do not learn these things from education or experience alone. We just naturally understand them. Our studies of right and wrong, and of beauty, are attempts to explain why something is right or beautiful, not to make rules for what is right or beautiful.\n\nCritics of art or morals cannot fully explain what is good or beautiful. Talking about why the Mona Lisa is a great painting may include words like \"light\" and \"color,\" but these do not explain why it is great. When we talk about our favorite book or painting, we often say there is \"something\" about it that is special. I think that both art and morals have this \"something\" that we cannot fully explain. This \"something\" is the most powerful part of art and morality.\n\nWe experience both right and wrong, and beauty and ugliness, at a deep level. This is something we can feel, but not fully explain. This connection between right and wrong, and beauty and ugliness, is stronger in literature. Literature is special because it has a moral message. It teaches us values that are important for living.",
            "Germany is a strong country today. It has a unique culture. This culture can be seen from the mountains in the south to the sea in the north. It can be felt from the city of Munich on the Alps to the city of Kiel on the Baltic Sea. It can also be seen in the city of Cologne on the Rhine River to the city of Dresden on the Elbe River.\n\nGermany was not always a strong country. The country has a history. Many people from different tribes created Germany. These tribes had their own culture. \n\nThe name \"Germany\" comes from the word \"Germania.\" This word has a disputed origin. Some people think it came from a tribe called the Tungrians. Others think it came from the word \"ger,\" which means spear. Another idea is that it came from the word \"garim,\" which means to shout. This could mean the Germans were loud.\n\nA long time ago, a Roman historian named Tacitus wrote about Germany. He said the Germans were not mixed with other people. They were a group of people who lived in a wild country with bad weather. Why would people leave their homes to come to Germany? Tacitus said people would not leave their homes to come to Germany. Instead, the Romans would go to Germany to get goods and to fight in wars.\n\nThe Germanic tribes lived near the Roman Empire. They traded with the Romans and joined the Roman army. This helped the Germans grow and become stronger.",
            "I looked down.  My mind was empty.  I was seeing something, but I was not thinking about it.  I was just looking.  A long time ago, I got some advice from an artist.  He told me to buy a book about drawing.  The book is called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\"  It teaches you how to draw.  One thing it teaches is to put a square around a picture you want to draw.  This helps you see the picture better.\n\nI tried to do that, but I could not.  I was seeing too much.  A bowl of fruit was in front of me.  It was on a table in a kitchen.  I could not see just the bowl.  I was seeing too many things at the same time.\n\nI remembered that some famous artists liked certain colors.  Picasso liked blue.  Monet liked green.  People from a long time ago liked many colors.  I was thinking that I could be an artist like them.  I was looking at the beginning of my picture.  I was looking at the start of my story.\n\nI picked up a pencil.  I wanted to start drawing.  My hand moved over the paper.  Water was calm and peaceful in my mind.  Then, my hand hit the handle of the toilet.  A piece of poop was stuck.  It would not go away.  I was trying to get it out.  I gripped the mop tightly and looked at the poop.  It was a brown, messy thing.  I was not happy about it.\n\nI waited a few minutes.  Then, I touched the toilet paper.  I wrapped it around my hand.  It felt like an oven mitt.  I bent down and put my hand into the toilet.  I was trying to get the poop out.",
            "Teenagers are dying while driving. Several factors cause this problem. The National Institutes of Health say one reason is that the teen brain is not ready for driving. Driving is a big responsibility. Most teenagers do not have enough experience. This makes them more likely to have accidents, including rollover accidents, speeding, and driving off the road.\n\nTeenagers also have more accidents when they drive with friends. This is a big problem. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center studied this. They found that the age of the passenger can cause more traffic accidents.\n\nTo make driving safer for teenagers, some states require a temporary license. This license limits the hours teenagers can drive and does not allow other minors as passengers. But these licenses are only temporary fixes.\n\nThe real problem is that most teenagers are not ready to drive. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman says 18 is too young for a regular driver's license. He did research that shows many young people like to take risks. This is why we should delay driving until they are older. If we continue to give driver's licenses to young teenagers, many more accidents will happen. Many more teenagers will die.\n\nWe can make laws to solve this problem. Schools can teach driving classes, but no one under 18 can drive. A temporary permit can still be given before a full license. Teenagers must also practice driving with an adult. The number of practice hours can be the same as in most states. This will make driving safer for all teenagers in the country.\n\nMy idea is not new. It is a simple way to make driving safer for our teenagers.",
            "I looked at films from the Library of Congress. They had many old Edison films. I watched all the trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films use editing to create illusions. My study was about the trick films. I looked at most of them and some of the later ones. \n\nMost trick films from this time are set in one place. They follow the rules of a play. The camera does not move. The shots are long or medium. This way is like a play or a magic show. The actors do not walk towards or away from the camera. They move side to side. \n\nOne film is Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors come in and move back and forth. They go out of the frame, but the camera does not follow. Most trick films have long shots and some medium shots. Close-up shots are never used. This is because in a play or magic show, the audience sees everything at the same time. \n\nMost trick films take only one shot to make. This is why they are short. They usually show tricks like magic, disappearing, or switching acts. However, sometimes one shot can be many pictures joined together. This creates the illusion of something happening. \n\nI looked at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895). It is a trick film. When you look closely, you can see where the physical shot starts, even though it looks like one shot.",
            "John Taylor was a strong supporter of Republicanism.  He was a farmer, but his farming work and short time in politics made him known for his strong opinions about freedom and government.  He wanted to protect and promote farming, the best job of all, in his ideas about government.  Taylor's belief in farming led him to think about many things, including how the government should be run.\n\nTaylor thought the United States had a good chance to create a perfect system of government.  This was because the country had no old traditions to follow, so the people who created the government could make their own rules.  Taylor believed in the natural rights of people.  He thought these rights are all connected - take away one, and the value of the others goes down.  He believed these rights should be beyond the power of the government.\n\nTaylor said that in the \"state of nature,\" strong and mean people have more power.  But he wanted this not to be true in a civilized society.  To create a good society, Taylor thought the government must consider both good and bad in people.  He believed that all government actions are good or bad, like people.  He thought good principles are those that protect private property, help farming, and stop selfish business.  A government with good principles would do what is fair, no matter who is in power.  Taylor believed that selfishness is natural, but it is bad when it hurts others.\n\nTaylor wanted a government that is very limited, with only the powers the Constitution says it has.  He thought a big government is expensive and could be mean.  But he also thought that following the Constitution too closely could be bad, without knowing the intentions of the people who made it.  Taylor thought the Declaration of Independence is more important than the Constitution, because it says the United States is a group of independent states, not one country.",
            "We look at Figure 17. The number of people who submit their commuter logs goes down sharply in the third month of the project. This is not good news. It is hard to know why this happens. One reason might be the cold weather in New England. Fewer people walk or bike to school in the winter. Also, December is the end of the school year. Students are busy finishing schoolwork and getting grades. They may forget to fill out the log. The holiday season starts in December and students go home for a month. They do not need to come to school. Classes start again in January. This might be another reason for the low number of logs. We started the Carpool Challenge Week in March. This was a special event to get people excited about the project again. It helped to increase the number of logs in March.\n\nWe had another problem. Many people like to drive their cars. This is a big part of our culture. We need to make alternative ways of commuting more attractive. We gave out prizes like gift cards to restaurants and coffee shops. We also gave gift cards to a bookstore and some stores. It would be interesting to know if bigger prizes would help more. For example, we could have given away a bike or a new car. This might have helped people stay interested in the project. The prizes did not change much during the project. If we had announced bigger prizes in December and January, we might have gotten more people to participate.",
            "An ETF is a type of security.  It follows a group of things like an index or a basket of assets.  But it is more flexible and trades like a stock on a stock exchange.  An ETF gives you the safety of a group of investments and the benefits of owning one stock.  You can sell it short, buy with borrowed money, and buy a small amount.  These benefits are attractive.  But there are some problems.  You have to pay a fee to buy or sell an ETF, just like you do to buy a stock.  One good thing about ETFs is that there are many different kinds available.  But it is always a good idea to check if the benefits are real and how big they are.  In this effort, we will look at the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 holdings.  We want to see if owning one ETF is as good as owning 10 different stocks.  We will also see if there is a better way to put these stocks together for a better return.\n\nTo make this easier, we will only look at the top 10 stocks that make up 63.58% of the ETF.  These are the stocks that make the ETF valuable.  Below are the top 10 stocks and how much of the ETF they make up.\n\nTo see how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF, we can use a formula to calculate their Beta and return.  We will use the percentage of the ETF that each stock makes up.  The results are in the chart below.\n\nFrom the chart, we can see that a portfolio of just the top 10 stocks would be 6.11% higher than the ETF.  This is a 16% increase in returns.  We can also see that the Beta of the top 10 stocks is .12 lower than the ETF.  This means that the top 10 stocks could give a higher return with less risk.  But we need to know if these results are real or just a chance.\n\nTo be sure, we will look at how much each stock can change in value.  We will calculate the standard deviation of each stock and compare it to the ETF.  This will help us see if the two portfolios are really different.",
            "One of Edgar Allan Poe's famous poems is called \"Dream-Land.\" In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe uses a word called \"Thulé\" two times. This word comes from Virgil, a famous ancient writer. Virgil used this word to name a place north of Britain. Many people thought this place was the edge of the known world. Poe liked the work of German writers. \n\nPoe's use of \"Thulé\" is important. It shows Poe knew the work of a German writer named Goethe. Goethe wrote a famous play called \"Faust.\" It was published in two parts, the first part in 1808 and the second part in 1832, the year Goethe died. In the second part of \"Faust,\" there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem is about a king whose wife dies after giving him a special cup. After her death, the king drinks a lot and cries. He then decides it is time to die and leaves his possessions to his children. He throws the cup into the ocean and dies. Poe's poem \"Dream-Land\" and Goethe's \"The King of Thulé\" are similar. Maybe one is a dark version of the other. This could be because Poe was thinking about his own loss and his drinking. A man named H P Grattan wrote a play called \"Faust\" in 1842, a year before Poe used the word \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" Poe mentions Thule twice in his writings. He uses the phrase \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and \"Dream-Land\" twice as a book end. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be read as two connected poems. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker talks about a dark and lonely place called Thule. He sees a world without color and is haunted by dead friends. This is like the story of the king in \"The King of Thule,\" who has lost his wife and is lonely. Goethe was a famous writer that Poe would have known. Poe admired another writer, Tennyson, who liked Goethe's work. Poe would have seen Goethe's work in many books that were published after the original publication.",
            "Under California law, can a person who got hurt after slipping and falling on a spill in a grocery store get extra money as punishment from the store owner? The store owner was told twice about the spill, but he did not clean it up for 30 minutes because he was eating dinner.\n\nA judge is unlikely to quickly stop the case. To get extra money as punishment, the person who got hurt must show that the store owner acted on purpose to cause harm. The store owner must have known that not cleaning the spill could cause an injury. The person who got hurt will argue that the store owner should have known this because many people had slipped and fallen in the store in the past because of spills. The store owner still did not clean up the spill.\n\nThe person who got hurt will also argue that the store owner's actions were very bad. However, this argument is not very strong. But it may still be valid because many people had slipped and fallen in the store in 2009, and the store owner did not take steps to make the store safe.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, an employee of the grocery store told the manager about a spill in an aisle. The manager said he was on a break and could not deal with customer complaints. Another employee told the manager about the spill 15 minutes later, but he still did not clean it up. At 5:30 pm, the person who got hurt slipped and fell on the spill and got a serious back injury. Before this happened, five other people had slipped and fallen in the store in 2009. The person who got hurt is now suing the grocery store for money to cover her medical expenses and for extra money as punishment.\n\nIn California, a person can get extra money as punishment if the other person acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Malice is when someone acts on purpose to cause harm. It can also be when someone acts very badly and with a clear disregard for the safety of others. The court has said that this is the case when someone knows that their actions could cause harm and still does not try to stop it.",
            "I studied Islam in a class at CBC about four years ago.  We had a big discussion in class about whether Islam is a hostile religion.  I think this question is still important today.  I have seen how the media's view of Islam has changed since 9/11.  At first, they had a negative view.  Later, they became too friendly.  I don't think in 2001 we could have elected a president like Barack Obama, who comes from a family with Muslim background.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad is interesting to me.  But it does not match the history I know of Muhammad.  I thought he forced people to become Muslims.  But the biography says he was a kind and humble man.  People came to him because they believed in his teachings.  I also see some similarities between the work of Jesus and the miracles of Muhammad.  For example, Muhammad multiplied food so there was enough for many people.  I think the writers wanted to show Muhammad as a humble man who did not need to prove anything.  It makes me think they are trying to take credit for the life of Jesus.\n\nThere are many stories in the biography that sound like they are trying to prove that Muhammad was a good leader.  But these stories come from second-hand information.  I don't think this makes them more believable.  It makes me question the truth of the stories.  I don't like this because it makes the stories seem suspicious.\n\nWhat bothers me most is that the biography tries to make Muhammad seem like a kind and wise man.  But history says he was not like that.  I think Muslims today should know the real story of Muhammad's life.",
            "The teachings of Jesus and the ideas he believed in are not what many Christians follow today.  If we look at the history of Christianity, we see that it has moved away from its roots.  In the past, people did not think about this.  Today, however, there is a growing awareness that things have changed.  Many people are thinking about what Jesus really said and did.  They want to know the true meaning of his teachings.\n\nSoon, a new movement will start.  People will try to understand what Jesus really meant.  They will look at the ideas that were added to Christianity over time.  This will take a long time, but it will happen.  Christianity will go back to its original form.  People will understand the true meaning of Jesus' teachings.\n\nWhen this happens, Christianity will become more like it was when Jesus was alive.  People will focus on his ideas, not on the things that were added later.  The church as an organization will still be strong.  But the differences between Christians will fade away.  Instead of being different from each other, they will be more alike.\n\nHistory is full of examples of big changes.  One example is how the Roman Empire, which once persecuted Christians, became a Christian country.  Our country has also had big changes.  From slavery to freedom, from being against African-Americans to having an African-American president.\n\nA big change is coming in the Christian world.  People will start to see Jesus' words as symbols, not as exact statements.  This will help make the change happen.  To understand what I am saying, we need to look at the history of Christianity.  Before Jesus, there was only Judaism.  The Jewish people had many different ideas and groups.  They had Sadducees, Pharisees, and others.  They did not all agree on what was true.",
            "The Jungle shows how people are naturally selfish. They only think about themselves and want a good life. They do not care about others who are lower than them. The book shows this in many ways. The owners of big factories want to make their companies as big and successful as possible. They do not care about anything that gets in their way or gets hurt because of their success. They do not worry about the pollution their factories make. They also do not care about their workers. They want to make money, not help their employees. The owners force their workers to work long hours for little pay. They can fire many people at once without warning. At that time, there were no laws to protect workers. The owners had too much power.\n\nThe book shows that the workers were treated badly. They had no help or organizations to turn to. Some workers tried to form groups to help themselves, but these groups were not very helpful. The workers were treated so badly that they were almost like slaves. They were always hungry and had to work hard to survive. They depended on their bosses for everything.\n\nThe Jungle is a sad story about how people are treated in a big city. It shows that some people do not care about others and only want to make more money.",
            "Many authors use special ways to give readers a certain feeling. Some methods are more effective. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these methods in his novel The Great Gatsby. He pairs words together that do not usually fit to give a special feeling. He also uses symbols to give meaning. Fitzgerald uses many colors to give meaning to important things. He builds up the meaning of colors like white, gray, red, and pink. He uses these colors to remind readers of a feeling.\n\nFitzgerald makes white and gray mean the same thing - uniformity. White is nice and gray is old and faded. He uses these colors in the beginning of the novel. Many characters wear white. Daisy and Jordan wear white clothes. People at parties wear white. Even the streets are white. But Fitzgerald also uses these colors for ordinary things. He makes the city streets \"white chasms\" and the cars \"gray.\"\n\nLater, Fitzgerald uses white and gray to show that something is not important. He uses these colors to describe Daisy. He says she is wearing white and is like a uniform. This shows that Daisy is not a special person, but just something Gatsby wants. Fitzgerald uses this technique many times to show that Daisy is like a uniform.\n\nFitzgerald uses colors to remind readers of a feeling. He uses red and pink to show something is important. But that is a different story.",
            "San Diego County is a great place for growing food. The weather is mild and sunny. Many crops grow well here, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, and herbs. Many people in San Diego want organic food. They are willing to pay more for it. This is good news for farmers who use special methods that do not hurt the earth.\n\nSome farmers in San Diego give tours of their farms. People can visit and learn about the farms. They can also walk and look for birds. This helps the farmers get money and help the environment.\n\nOrganic farming has many benefits. It helps plants and animals live in the area. But it is harder and more expensive than other ways of farming. Farmers must work harder to get rid of pests and weeds. They also need to put special food on the soil to help it grow.\n\nThe land I am talking about is near the town of Potrero. It is 160 acres of land with different kinds of plants and trees. Many animals live there, including some that are in danger. The government has a plan to protect them. The plan includes over 100 kinds of plants and animals. Some are endangered, like the kangaroo rat and the California gnatcatcher.\n\nPeople lived in this area a long time ago. Then, ranchers and loggers came. They used the land for many years. Now, a farmer could use the land for organic farming. I looked at a government program to see how a farmer could get help. I also looked at a real farm in the area to see what they do.",
            "Culture is a very important part of any negotiation. But culture is not the same as what it might seem to be. It is not a single thing. It is not the same everywhere. We should not say that all Russians are stubborn or that all Japanese people are accommodating. This is not true. Understanding a culture is not just about what it is, but also what it means. Knowing about a culture can help us understand how it will affect a negotiation.\n\nWhen we meet people from another culture, we think of them in relation to our own culture. This can lead to comparisons. To understand another culture, we can learn about its history or its customs. We should not try to change another culture, but accept it for what it is. This is especially true in negotiations, especially if we have less strength or power.\n\nCulture does not only exist between countries. Companies also have their own culture. For example, some companies value hard work and long hours, while others value relaxation and freedom. We can see this in the way employees dress, how they communicate, and how they are hired. Even within the same country, different companies can have different cultures. This shows that cultures are not always what they seem.\n\nValues are even more important to understand. They tell us why a culture behaves in a certain way. If a culture values saving face or harmony, a negotiator will not publicly disagree or argue. If a culture values hard work, a negotiator will not settle easily. Understanding these values can help us prepare for a negotiation. But it is also important to learn about our opponent and their needs to make a successful negotiation.",
            "Two famous thinkers, St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas, each wrote about the existence of God. We will look at their ideas and see if one is better than the other. We will assume they are both correct about the Christian God.\n\nTo compare their ideas, we will first look at St. Anselm's argument. He says we can find God in our own minds. He believes that because we think about God, God must exist. St. Anselm thinks we don't need to look outside ourselves for proof of God's existence. He says this is an example of faith.\n\nThomas Aquinas has a different idea. He thinks we can prove God exists using reason and what we see in the world. He does not need faith. Aquinas gives five reasons why God exists. He says that change, cause, chance, and order in the world all need a creator. He is saying that God must exist because the world is not perfect and has problems that need a solution.\n\nWe can see that their ideas are different. St. Anselm believes in faith, while Thomas Aquinas believes in reason. We will continue to look at their ideas to see if one is better than the other.",
            "A long time ago, in the fifth or sixth century, a prince was born. He would later be called Buddha. This man lived a long life and became very wise. He gave up the world and found enlightenment. His teachings started Buddhism, a very old religion. It is now 2,500 years old. Today, it is different from what it was when Buddha was alive. This change can be seen in many countries, like Sri Lanka. In Sri Lanka, people celebrate the water-cutting ceremony every year. Monks and normal people take part in this ceremony. It has some importance, but Buddha never taught about a celebration like this. Changes like this happen in the Theravada Buddhist community. They occur in both the monastery and the community of regular people. These changes happen because of internal and external forces.\n\nInternal forces come from people who follow the Buddha's teachings. External forces come from people who do not follow Buddhism. A hostile force is something that hurts the Buddhist community. A benign force is something that helps or does not hurt the community.\n\nLet us look at the basics of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists trust in three things: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is the Buddhist teachings. They are found in the Tripitaka - three baskets of text. The Sutta Pitaka has the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka has the rules for living, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka has the ideas about the world. These ideas are Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (suffering in life), and Anicca (nothing is permanent). Understanding these ideas can end the cycle of death and rebirth, called Sansara. Sansara is a cycle of suffering, desire, hatred, and delusion. When one becomes enlightened, these things go away.\n\nThe Vinaya Pitaka has rules for living. For non-monks, there are five rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not misbehave, and do not take alcohol. Monks have many more rules. The most important idea in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths. First, life has suffering. Second, attachment causes suffering. Third, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico had a long rivalry from 1836 to 1893. This lasted for 57 years. The worst time of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848. The United States won and got new land from Mexico. This included Texas and the American Southwest. The two countries had many problems, but the rivalry finally stopped before the First World War.\n\nThis is not unusual. Countries that share a border often have disagreements. These disagreements can lead to long-lasting rivalries. The United States and Mexico are an example of this. Many countries near the United States have good relations with it. However, Mexico and Cuba have had problems with the United States for a long time.\n\nOne problem between the two countries was religion. Many people in the United States did not like Catholicism. This was a major issue between the two countries. In the past, the United States and the Soviet Union had a rivalry based on politics. But the United States and Mexico had a rivalry based on religion. This was a problem because of the distrust between the English and Spanish.\n\nDiehl and Goerts wrote about 17 problems between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry. Most of these problems were about border issues. These issues included border raids from Mexican territory into the United States. The United States and Mexico finally stopped these problems when they used force to control their borders.\n\nThe rivalry between the two countries started to end when Mexico became dependent on the United States. The United States then changed its goals from expanding its territory to helping Mexico economically.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I got very sick with an illness I did not know about. I was 46 years old and a nurse. I chose to be a nurse because people always told me, \"You can find a job easily because people will always get sick.\" My dream was to be a scientist or a journalist, but I chose nursing instead.\n\nNow, I am disabled. I have been getting money from the government for 15 years, but I have nothing left. Every day is hard for me. I am lucky to have my family and some good friends who help me. When disaster happens, it is hard to feel strong.\n\nMy point is that bad things can happen in life. We cannot always prepare for them and need help from others. I agree that the government is not always reliable. But I think it is better for Americans to help each other and ask for help instead of trying to do everything alone.\n\nSome people say that America was built on individualism. But the pioneers who came to America a long time ago did not make it by themselves. They needed each other's help. So, be prepared for disasters. I have a kit with food, water, and other important things in case of an emergency. But it is also important to know your neighbors and help them.",
            "Why do living things change over time? Are there limits that influence how they change? In 1917, D'Arcy Thompson said that it is hard to explain even simple living things with math. Today, we still face this problem. Recently, scientists have used math to study how some animals grow and develop over time. Our study is exploring how math can help us understand how living things change over time.\n\nWe are studying the shell of a certain type of animal called Prunum. We want to know how it changes over time and how it has changed in the past. We used special pictures taken with X-rays to measure the shell's shape. We then used a computer program to create models of what the shell might have looked like in the past. These models help us understand how living things can change.\n\nA shell is like a tube that grows over time. It makes a spiral shape, with each part of the shell growing around a center point. This center point is called the columella. The shell grows in rounds, called whorls. Each whorl is connected by a line, called a suture. The last whorl is the biggest. The shell has a top and a bottom, a point called the apex and a base. The animal lives in its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nWe can look at a shell from different angles. There are four main views: from the top, from the bottom, from the side, and from the front. The front view is the usual way to look at a shell.\n\nTo count the whorls, we look at the shell from the top. We draw a line where the first connection between whorls starts. Then, we count the whorls from that line. We can only count a whole number of whorls. If a whorl is half done, we count it as half.\n\nA shell is like a path that the animal follows as it grows. We can use math to trace this path. We can then change the math to see how the animal's growth might have been different. This helps us understand how living things change over time.",
            "Indonesia's rates of baby and young child deaths have not changed much in the last ten years.  The country is almost on track to meet some of the goals from the Millennium Development Plan, like improving water and sanitation.  However, progress in health care for mothers and babies is slow.  This means Indonesia will likely not meet its goals by 2015.  There are many reasons for this.  We will talk about them below.\n\nOne good thing is that more babies are born with a trained health worker present.  Now, 72% of births have a trained worker.  But, even though this is an improvement, it is not as good as it sounds.  Many of these trained workers are midwives who cannot help in case of a problem.  This is why many mothers die from heavy bleeding.  There is still much work to do.\n\nFewer children are treated by a health worker when they have diarrhea.  We do not have complete information about care for new mothers after birth.  However, it is clear that this is a problem.  Few mothers and babies get the care they need.\n\nFew women have a cesarean section.  This is a problem.  The rate of cesarean sections is 7% in cities, but only 2% in rural areas.  This means that cities have better access to healthcare than rural areas.  This is unfair.\n\nAnother problem is that people with less money have a hard time getting healthcare.  In fact, there is a 27% difference in healthcare use between the richest and the poorest people in the country.  The poor cannot afford healthcare because they have to pay out of their own pocket.\n\nNow, we must think about how to improve healthcare for mothers and babies.  The main question is how to make healthcare services more available.  Should we make programs to help mothers and babies, or should we make the healthcare system better in general?  There are pros and cons to each approach.  Program-specific approaches are attractive because they are clear and can give quick results.  However, this can lead to problems.  When we spend a lot of money on one area, it can leave other areas without enough money.  Also, many programs can cause confusion and extra work for the healthcare system.",
            "Victorian novels are noted for their detailed descriptions and focus on the rich people of that time. Two famous novels that are different from this type are \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights\". These novels often use mystery and strange events to help readers understand the characters. This makes the characters more interesting and adds depth to their thoughts and feelings.\n\nIn \"Oliver Twist\", the main character has many strange and confusing thoughts. He is still seeing two men, Sikes and Crackit, arguing. The words they say are still in his mind. When he pays attention, he finds that he is talking to them. Suddenly, he hears the sound of guns and there are loud cries and shouts. He feels pain and is moved quickly away. He sees many strange things, but he is not in control.\n\nIn \"Oliver Twist\", the author uses strange events, like dreams, to show what is happening inside the main character's mind. In one scene, Oliver remembers a violent event that happened to him. He relives it as if it is happening again. He is very scared and in pain. He does not understand what is happening to him. The author wants the reader to see that Oliver has no control over his life. He is not in charge of what happens to him. The author wants the reader to feel sorry for Oliver.\n\nIn another scene, the main character says that time is passing quickly. A day comes and goes, and then night comes again. But it is not a normal day and night. The day is short and the night is long. The main character is very unhappy. He is in a difficult situation and it is hard for him to feel safe.",
            "A few years ago, I worked in an after-school program that helped elementary school students. I tried my best to help them in their difficult subjects, but I was good at English and reading. My boss asked me to help a boy named Adrian. He was in third or fourth grade and had trouble reading. I saw that something was strange. He knew some letters, but others he did not understand. He spoke good English, but his mother did not speak English. She spoke Spanish.\n\nOne day, I took care of him while his classmates went on a trip. His mother came in and we talked in Spanish, but I did not know much Spanish. I then understood that Adrian could read, but did not know the English alphabet. I hope he is doing better now.\n\nI tell this story to show that a language problem exists in schools, especially in California. Even if a child speaks good English, reading can be hard. I think everyone agrees that this is a problem. The solution for Adrian was simple: tutoring in English reading. But for children who do not speak much English, the problem is more complicated.\n\nThere is no one answer. We need to use many things together. We can use the dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, and ESL classes. But we must use them all together. \n\nThe dual language system is a good idea. It helps all children, not just those who speak Spanish. Children in this kind of program do better in school. Many people are afraid of this idea, thinking it is a waste of money and that most children will not benefit. But this is not true. If we use this system in all schools, all children will benefit.\n\nBut how do we do this? Do we need all teachers to be bilingual? No, that is not possible. We can have special helpers who are bilingual. They can assist teachers and students. This is a good idea.",
            "When we are young, people often tell us that there is something bigger than we are. This is something we cannot understand. Some people go to church to learn about it. Others go to the temple or look inside themselves for answers. Many people accept the religion their parents teach them. But some people do not believe in it. They think there is nothing beyond what they know. They may accept one idea and then change their mind and accept another. We search for meaning in life through our own ideas about spirituality.\n\nI asked my father about his favorite bird. It was a cardinal. We sat on our porch, listening to the rain. He looked out into the rain, thinking about something. He had lost weight and his hair was thinning. He did not look at me. I felt sad, scared, and could not talk to him about how much I would miss him. I hugged him and we sat together in the rain.\n\nMy father died in December, a few days after my twenty-second birthday. The medicine and radiation did not help him. They kept him alive a little longer. I wanted to remember my father when he was alive, not how he died. I did not want to see him go away. I wanted to remember him as he was, not how he suffered. I thought, \"What kind of God would do this?\" I did not pray to God that night. If God exists, I thought, he is not listening to me.\n\nI did not want to watch my father die. I wanted to remember him, not how he died. I knew my father better than anyone. I knew he would not want me to watch him die. So I stayed in bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one called me.",
            "The Gothic Novel is an interesting mix of old and new. This is exactly how writer Ian Watt describes it. The Gothic style has been both praised and criticized. Some people say it is shallow, while others say it evokes a feeling of the 'terrible sublime' (Burke). The first Gothic Novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, combined old and new ideas to create a new way to write stories. Walpole used old theatrical elements and new ideas to create what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic style uses ideas from medieval theater, architecture, and traditions. Even when The Castle of Otranto was first published, the word \"gothic\" was used to describe many things. Some people thought it was old-fashioned or not sophisticated.\n\nThe combination of the old and new ideas in Gothic novels is what makes them interesting. This is because the old ideas are presented in a new way, allowing readers to see the characters' feelings and thoughts more clearly. This is why Gothic novels have been popular for a long time, even though they were written a long time ago.\n\nOne important idea in Gothic novels is the concept of chivalry. Chivalry was a way to train knights in the Middle Ages. It meant being brave, honorable, and competent. Many Gothic writers, including Walpole, liked chivalry because it represented a high ideal. They thought that people in their time did not live up to this ideal. They used chivalric ideas and manners to make the past seem romantic and ideal. This is because Walpole and others wanted to show that people in the past were better than those in the present.\n\nWalpole wrote The Castle of Otranto during a difficult time in history. He was worried about the future and thought that people had lost the good qualities of the past. This is why he wrote about characters like Frederic, who was a prince and a brave and courteous knight. Frederic's description includes many traditional chivalric images. He has suffered a great deal and is now supposed to be dead. But he is actually alive and will return to fight for what is right. The idea of the gallant and courteous knight is an important part of the Gothic style.",
            "The supply chain is a series of actions that helps move goods from the customer's order to the final product. It includes getting raw materials, making the product, and delivering it to the customer. The term supply chain management was created in 1982 by a consultant named Keith Oliver. He explained how to plan and control the supply chain to meet customer needs quickly and efficiently.\n\nThere are six important parts of a supply chain: making the product, getting the materials, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these parts to give the best service to customers.\n\nFirst, making the product is the start of the supply chain. Making the product is the base for the whole supply chain. The making stage answers the questions of when, why, where, and how things are made. Before making the product, managers must know what customers want. They look at the market to see what customers need. The market shows what customers are asking for.\n\nAfter studying the market, managers decide what products to make and how many. Then they decide where to make the products and which factory will make the right amount of products for the customers. Managers also decide how to schedule work and take care of the machines. Making the product is very important in the supply chain. Every detail is crucial. If managers do not plan carefully, it can take a long time and cost a lot of money.\n\nFor example, I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target. Both companies have a plan for each part of the business. There is a plan for how employees dress and how goods are received from trucks. Having a plan helps the company work smoothly and avoid confusion.\n\nThe second important part of the supply chain is getting the materials. Getting the materials means making decisions about the company's strengths and weaknesses. A company may have many different departments that make different parts of a product. The manager decides which department is best for each part. The manager may also decide to ask another company to help make the product. This is called outsourcing. The main reason for outsourcing is to make the product quickly and with good quality while keeping costs low.",
            "A sign on a street in Burma, also known as Myanmar, says Hitler is alive. Ellen Page, a famous actress, holds a cardboard sign with this message. Burma is a country in Southeast Asia. It is ruled by a group of military leaders who took control in 1962. In 2007, people protested in the streets. These protests were called the Saffron Revolution. Many Buddhist monks led the protests. They wore yellow robes. The government allowed the monks to protest at first, but then violence increased. The military attacked the monasteries. They arrested and imprisoned journalists. A Japanese journalist was killed in 2007. The government says 13 people were killed, but a former army officer claims many more were killed.\n\nThis is not new. Governments have wanted to control their people for a long time. In ancient Rome, leaders thought they were chosen by gods. Japanese leaders think they are gods. Our current president has meetings with a man who says he represents a group called Stupid People Worldwide.\n\nThere are many examples of governments hurting their people. In 1989, people protested in China's Tiananmen Square. Many were killed. The number of deaths is not known. In Rwanda, a group of people killed others because of their tribe. Many people were hurt or killed. In Germany, a man named Hitler hurt many people because of their religion.",
            "Duke Ellington's place in jazz comes from his long life and his ability to make his orchestra strong. Ellington did not often play the piano in his songs, but as a composer, he wrote great music that showed how well his band members could play. He made a framework where musicians could improvise and also wrote music that used the special sound of each musician. This made his songs sound new and original.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary says Ellington's sound was special because he used the voice as an instrument. This is seen in Creole Love Call, a song he made early in his career. In this song, Ellington uses the voice to add color and texture without words. He also uses the voice to fit with the style of each musician. This song is a slow blues with six parts. Each part is different. \n\n- Part 1: A call and response between voice and wind instruments. The voice starts smooth, then gets rougher.\n- Part 2: A muted trumpet solo that makes the basic melody sound longer and uses some extra notes.\n- Part 3: A clarinet solo that sounds high and is backed by a piano that plays in a special rhythm.\n- Part 4: The whole band plays a call and response, just like in part 1, but with brass and wind instruments.\n- Part 5: The most exciting part of the song, where the wind instruments call and respond in a high sound, and the brass and rhythm instruments play in a special way.\n- Part 6: The song goes back to the start, with call and response between voice and wind instruments. This time, the voice sounds like a special instrument.\n\nEllington used the voice to make his songs sound new and interesting. In Hot and Bothered, he combined his good orchestration with his ear for sound. He used a call and response between a trumpeter and a singer to make a rich and special sound. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) shows how well he used a trombone player to introduce the melody.\n\nEllington's use of the voice in his songs is one way he made jazz special. He made his musicians sound good and created new and interesting music.",
            "She felt something was missing in her life. This feeling did not go away. It started when she was 14 years old. It was still there three years later, when she was 17. She wanted a person, not just a thing. But she did not like any boys. Some boys liked her. They tried to talk to her, but she did not like them. She often thought about why this was happening to her.\n\nShe lived at home with her parents. They were kind and calm. They rarely argued with each other. They argued with her only about her independence. She was different from her parents. She was outgoing and fun, and everyone liked her.\n\nToday was not a calm day. She heard a loud sound from the kitchen. She ran to the room and saw her mother on the floor. Her mother was in pain and saying \"Ow\" many times. Her daughter ran to her and put her hand on her. \"Mom, what's wrong?!\" she asked. Her mother said, \"Ow... sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital.\" Her daughter helped her mother to the car and drove her to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital had a bad smell.

            "This study had one purpose. It was to show that eating a Mediterranean-style diet, called the Med diet, can help prevent heart disease and stroke. We found that women who ate this type of food had a lower risk of these diseases.\n\nThe Med diet is a special way of eating. It includes more plant foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes. It also includes fish and less animal products and fatty foods. Drinking some alcohol in moderation is okay.\n\nBefore this study, other studies had shown that eating a Med diet can help lower the risk of dying from any cause and from heart disease. But they did not look at the risk of stroke or dying from a stroke.\n\nWe studied 74,886 women between the ages of 38 and 63 who were not sick with heart disease or diabetes. They were all part of a big study of nurses in 11 US states. We asked them to tell us about what they ate over the past year six times between 1984 and 2004. More than 95% of the women kept participating for 20 years.\n\nWe used questionnaires to ask about what they ate. We also checked to make sure the information was correct. We looked at the women's medical records to see if they got sick with heart disease, died from heart disease, or had a stroke. If we did not have the records, we considered it a possible case and included it in our study.\n\nWe also looked at other things like how much they weighed, if they smoked, if they took aspirin, if they took vitamins, and if they exercised. We took the average of what they ate over the past two years to get a better idea of their long-term eating habits. We controlled for things that could affect the results, like age, smoking, weight, menopause, and exercise.\n\nWe used a special method to see if eating a Med diet was linked to heart disease and stroke. We looked at the women who ate the most Med-style food and compared them to those who ate the least. We found that women who ate more Med-style food had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\nOver 20 years, we found 2391 cases of heart disease, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 deaths from heart disease and stroke. Women who ate the most Med-style food were less likely to get heart disease or stroke than women who ate the least. Their risk was 29% lower.",
            "In 2007, the United States had a big financial problem. Many people lost their jobs, and the value of homes dropped. The government and big companies were in trouble. We must ask: how did this happen? And how can we stop it? In short, the financial problem was caused by bad choices made by politicians. They forced banks to give money to people who could not pay it back. The banks also sold these loans to other companies, which created a big problem.\n\nThe financial crisis started in 1999. President Clinton wanted to be president again. He wanted to be popular, so he made it easier for people to get loans. This created a big problem for the future. A writer from the New York Times, Steven Holmes, wrote about this in 1999. He said Fannie Mae, a company that gives loans, was under pressure to give loans to people who could not afford them. He also said this could cause a problem in the future.\n\nMany things combined to make the economy worse. New types of loans were made, like loans with rates that could change. These loans made it easy for people to borrow money, but it also made them very vulnerable. When the housing market dropped, many people lost a lot of money. The top five investment banks in the US had $4.1 trillion dollars of debt in 2007. This was a big problem. Some banks were sold or shut down, and others were forced to change.\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two big companies that help people get loans, had $5 trillion dollars of debt. They were put under government control in 2008. This financial crisis was a big problem that affected many people.",
            "Exposition is a part of your story where you tell the reader important information. But it can also be boring. Dr. Merlin says she sometimes gets frustrated when she writes too much and her readers lose interest.\n\nYou probably know the writing tip \"Show, don't tell.\" But Dr. Merlin still makes mistakes and writes too much exposition. This is when you tell the reader too much information at once. It can be like a character dumping too much information on another character.\n\nExposition is like a big speech. The author is telling the reader what to know. In stories, this can be when one character talks a lot about something. In film, it's when someone talks a lot to another character.\n\nLet's look at an example. A story might say, \"The heroine met her husband at a place and time. They got married in a big ceremony. He was murdered in front of her.\" But if the story spends two pages on this, with only a few lines of dialogue, it's boring. You want to know more about the husband and why he's important to the heroine.\n\nYou should show the reader how much the husband loves his wife and how she feels about him. Maybe he says something kind or does something special. Maybe she thinks about him often or feels sad when he's not there. This helps the reader connect with the story and care about what happens.\n\nIn short, you need to add details to the story. You can't just say, \"They met, they married, he died.\" You need to show the reader why this is important. \n\nSometimes it's hard to resist telling too much. Maybe you're introducing a new character and you want to tell everything about him. But try to show it instead. For example, you might say, \"He used to be in the Air Force and now he works at a gas station. He likes fishing and dreams of owning the station one day.\" This is better than saying, \"He was in the Air Force, now he works at a gas station, he's been married twice, no kids, likes to fish, and wants to own the station.\"",
            "I watched two news programs from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was live from NBC 4 on August 13, 2011. The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio. He stabbed his wife. The police arrested him. His name was Shad Hostettler. The news showed his picture. He looked very bad. They talked about this story for two minutes. I think they said enough.\n\nThe next story was about a man named Travis Buyers, 18 years old. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area. He was very sick. The police did not know who shot him. They were investigating. This story was short. I think it was because the man was black. I have seen this before. When a white person is a victim of a crime, the news talks a lot. But when a black person is a victim, the news talks less.\n\nThe next story was about a helicopter that was shot. It was a Med-Flight helicopter. The police think it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. They want people to help find the person who shot the helicopter. They are offering a reward of $5,000.\n\nThe news also talked about the weather. They said it would rain and be hot on Saturday afternoon. The temperature would be in the mid to low eighties all weekend. They wanted to keep people watching.\n\nAnother story was about a robbery at a store in Columbus. A black man robbed the store. He was wearing a hoodie and was about 6 feet tall and 150 pounds. The news talked a lot about how black he was.\n\nThe last story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez. He was a big drug dealer from Texas. He was caught for selling a lot of marijuana in Ohio. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison. The news said he would be in prison for 300 months. They also said he was Hispanic. I don't think that was important to the story.",
            "There is a strong connection between brothers. This connection can be very good or very bad. It is made up of many feelings: love, pride, jealousy, and anger. Brothers know each other very well. They can see themselves in each other. When brothers are very sad or in big trouble, their true feelings are shown. These feelings can have big costs. To understand brothers, you must understand the problems that come with their feelings. When you can look at a brother and see yourself, you see yourself in a real way.\n\nIn a story called \"The Scarlet Ibis\", two brothers deal with these feelings. They go on a hard journey in a beautiful place. They are very disappointed and very proud at the same time. Only one brother survives. The story shows how one brother feels through how he acts and what he does. The narrator also tells us how the brother feels and what he sees in the world around him. This helps us understand why he does the things he does.\n\nThe big feeling that drives the brother is pride. From the time he and his little brother Doodle go out together, the brother feels angry at Doodle. He wanted a brother who could do things with him, like running and climbing trees. But Doodle was sick and could not do these things. This was hard for the brother to accept. He even thought about hurting Doodle. But when Doodle smiled, the brother's anger went away. This shows that the brother truly loved his brother.",
            "The human brain is a very complex system. It helps us think and remember. A long time ago, people thought of the brain like a clay tablet. Then they thought of it like a piece of paper. Next, it was like a book. Now, some people think of it like a computer. These ideas are not perfect. They can lead to mistakes.\n\nInformation gets into the brain from our senses. Our senses include our eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin. They turn things like touch, heat, and light into electrical signals. The brain uses these signals to understand the world.\n\nThe brain works in two ways. Bottom-up means breaking down information into small parts. Top-down means using what we already know to help us understand. For example, when you see a picture of a black box, the brain first looks at the colors and edges. Then it uses what it knows about boxes to decide what it is.\n\nThe brain also has a filter. It decides what information is important and what we should pay attention to. We might see many things, but we only pay attention to some of them. Our brain can pick out our name in a loud room, but we might not notice every small thing around us.\n\nThe brain needs a place to store information. It has three kinds of memory: sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is stored. There are different ways to store different kinds of information. For example, our brains store words in different ways, like how they look, how they sound, and what they mean.\n\nInformation is not just stored, it must also be kept safe. Some studies on animals show that the brain keeps information in working memory for about 20 seconds by sending an electrical signal through a group of brain cells. Long-term memory is thought to be stored in the shape of certain kinds of proteins.\n\nThere are many ways to think about how the brain stores knowledge. Some come from people's memories, some from computers, and some from studying how the brain works. One idea is that the brain is like a network of connected ideas. For example, if we think of a chair, we might also think of a table, which we might think of as made of wood.",
            "Aldous Huxley is worried about the future. He writes a book called Brave New World to show how people might live in a world controlled by technology and capitalism. In this world, people care more about being happy now than about being an individual. From a young age, they are taught to be happy and not to think deeply. The people in this world are not really in charge. They are controlled by the World Controller. \n\nWe can see that Huxley does not like this kind of society. He uses ideas from Marxism to show his worries. Marxism is a way of thinking about how societies work. Huxley uses words from Marxism, like \"homogeny\" and \"reification\", to show that he is worried about the way people live in his world. \n\nIn Brave New World, people do not know about the real world. They are too busy looking after themselves. They are not allowed to think about their place in society. They are happy to buy things and enjoy themselves. The people in charge, the Alphas and Betas, do not care about fairness. They are happy to take what they want. \n\nIn Brave New World, people do not love each other. They do not feel strong emotions. They just want to be happy. They talk about each other's bodies, not their feelings. This shows that Huxley thinks that technology and capitalism are taking away people's freedom to feel and think deeply. \n\nThe people in Brave New World are happy to obey the rules. They do not want to change the way things are. This is like what Marx said about the proletariat, the working class. They are fooled into thinking they are better than others as long as they keep buying and following the rules.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for about two and a half years. Getting around campus can be difficult. My freshman year, I lived in East Halls dorm, which is far from the center of campus. It took me 25 minutes to walk to classes in the Willard building on bad days. The weather in State College can be bad.\n\nI talked to an old friend who rides a bike. He said it is the best way to get around campus. Bicycling is good for your body and is the most efficient way to travel. You can eat a bowl of oatmeal and ride your bike 30 miles or more. I now live off campus, far from the center of campus. I bought a bike this year, and it was a good decision. My classes are in the Thomas building, which is 25 minutes away on foot. But on a bike, it takes only 5 minutes. The road I take, Pollock Road, is not always easy to ride on.\n\nWalking is also a good option, but I am too busy to walk. If I didn't have a bike, I would have to walk to Thomas building every day. That would take 30-40 minutes. That is 2.5 hours every week. I don't have that much time."
