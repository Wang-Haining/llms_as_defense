            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "This report is about two models that help us understand a sleep problem called insomnia. The biological model looks at genetics and health problems. The sociocultural model looks at how environment and society affect sleep. This report reviews studies that relate to these models and explains each one.\n\nInsomnia is a sleep problem. It can be caused by other mental problems or medical issues. There are different kinds of sleep disorders. Some are called Dyssonmias. These are problems with sleeping. Others are called Parasomnias. These are problems with behaving while sleeping.\n\nDyssonmias are problems with sleeping. They include insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, and other sleep problems. Insomnia is when you have trouble sleeping. Hypersomnia is when you have trouble staying awake. Narcolepsy is a problem with falling asleep suddenly.\n\nParasomnias are problems with behaving while sleeping. They include nightmares, sleepwalking, and other sleep problems. The biological model of sleep disorders looks at genetics and health. It also looks at how our bodies work. One study found that a special part of the brain called the hypothalamus helps us sleep and wake up. This part of the brain has special cells that help us sleep. If these cells do not work, we may have trouble sleeping.\n\nThe study used mice to test this theory. The mice had special receptors in their brains that helped them sleep. When these receptors were activated, the mice slept more. If they did not work, the mice were more awake. This study suggests that genetics and environment can affect our sleep. If we have a problem with these receptors, we may have trouble sleeping. This can affect our daily life, like going to school or work.\n\nThe sociocultural model looks at how environment and society affect sleep. If we inherit a problem with our sleep receptors, it could affect our sleep. This could cause problems in our daily life. We may have trouble focusing or performing tasks that need attention.",
            "Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) is a problem with the brain's ability to hear and understand sounds. People with CAPD can hear sounds clearly, but their brain has trouble making sense of them. The brain is like a computer that takes in information. For people with CAPD, the computer has a problem processing this information.\n\nThe idea of CAPD was first talked about in the 1950s. Researchers were trying to understand why some children had trouble with communication. In 1954, a team of researchers in Italy started testing children with this problem. They wanted to know how the brain processes sound. In 1961, another researcher came up with a way to test how the brain hears two sounds at the same time.\n\nCAPD is a complex problem. People with CAPD may have trouble:\n\n- Hearing sounds in space. For example, they may have trouble finding the source of a sound.\n- Distinguishing between two or more sounds.\n- Recognizing sound patterns. \n- Understanding changes in speech, like when someone says something with a sarcastic tone.\n- Blocking out one sound when another sound comes in.\n- Understanding the order of sounds.\n\nTo find out if someone has CAPD, doctors use tests. These tests look at how the person hears and reacts to sounds. They may use questionnaires, observe how the person behaves, and test their hearing. There is no single test that works for everyone. The tests may ask the person to listen to a series of words or numbers and separate them. More advanced tests record the sound waves in the ear and see how the person responds.\n\nTeachers can help students with CAPD in a classroom. They can make sure the student is close to the teacher when giving instructions, speak clearly and slowly, and use visual aids like pictures and gestures. They can also give the student extra time to understand and follow instructions.",
            "The play Twelfth Night says something important about lies and how people use them. Sometimes, lies can be helpful. But, in the end, people must stop lying or they can lose themselves forever. One problem with stopping a lie is that it can cause people to feel alone. They may choose between protecting themselves or their relationships with others. Some people may not be angry when they find out they were lied to. But others will be very upset.\n\nThe play makes us think about when people change their gender to pretend to be someone else. This is a big issue because it raises many questions. Why do people want to hide their real selves and pretend to be someone else? In the play, a woman named Viola wants to protect herself from harm. So, she pretends to be a man. This helps her, but it also makes her feel alone. She cannot talk to the women she knows because she is pretending to be a man. This makes things worse because the woman Olivia starts to love Viola, but thinks she is a man. Viola also has feelings for a man named Orsino, but she cannot express them because she is pretending to be a man.\n\nThe play shows how lying can help people understand their true feelings. Two characters, Olivia and Orsino, may have secret feelings for each other. But they do not know this until Viola, pretending to be a man, is around. This makes them think about their feelings. But it is not clear if Olivia really likes women or if she just likes the way Viola looks as a man.\n\nThe play shows that Olivia is easy to convince and can change her mind quickly. She starts to love another man, Sebastian, and then thinks of Viola as a family member, not a love interest. This makes us think that Olivia is not really interested in women, but rather likes to judge people by how they look.",
            "Many observers note that German colonial rule was very cruel. One example is the German treatment of the Ovaherero and Nama people in German South West Africa. German rule was not the same everywhere. The colonies had different policies and rulers. Education was also different in each colony. When the British took control of German East Africa in 1919, they found many educated and literate Africans. The Germans did a good job of teaching in Kamerun and other colonies, according to some writers.\n\nBut South West Africa, now called Namibia, was different. There, the government did not help much with native education. Instead, missionaries helped with education, but they got little help from the government. The government, however, spent a lot of money on schools for Europeans in the colony. They even helped and controlled the schools run by missionaries. These education policies had a big effect on South West Africa, even after Germany lost control. In South West Africa, most people did not learn to read or write. Various reasons, like social and economic problems, made South West Africa different from other German colonies. This paper will look at these reasons and study the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards African people.\n\nThere is much information about education in the German colonies. Most of this information is in German and was written a long time ago. These early writings described the education systems in the colonies. Later writings, in English, compared education in the different colonies and studied specific parts of education. These studies showed that the education systems in the colonies were very different. One important study, by Cohen, compares education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen says that the large number of settlers in South West Africa explains many of the differences in education.\n\nSouth West Africa had a good climate, but much of the land was a desert. The number of white people living in South West Africa was large. By 1913, almost 15,000 Europeans lived there. This was many more than the number of settlers in the colony with the next largest number, East Africa.",
            "Heavy metal music is a big group of music styles. It has grown a lot over 100 years. Now it is hard to make a complete list of all the different kinds. Most of these styles - like rock, country, and jazz - have smaller groups within them. Heavy metal rock is a very expressive style of music. It shows a wide range of feelings, but often they are sad or angry.\n\nHeavy metal started a long time ago. People soon saw that it was flexible and could be changed to make new kinds. These new kinds then split into even smaller groups. This keeps happening today.\n\nTo understand heavy metal music now, you need to understand where it comes from and what makes it different. Heavy metal is often a sad and dark kind of music. It has more loud instruments, more strong beats, and more dramatic sounds. The people who play heavy metal music are very good at playing their instruments.\n\nHeavy metal music is also connected to the use of drugs. In the past, people used psychedelic drugs to create new and crazy sounds. These sounds were very different from most popular music at the time. Later, new kinds of heavy metal music took some of these ideas from the past. Some songs express the sadness and anger that is common in heavy metal music. For example, the song \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles is a famous example of early heavy metal music. It is a fast, sad song about the effects of drugs. The Beatles wrote it to show that they could make heavy music like the Rolling Stones.",
            "Many years before the famous Surrealist artists started painting their dreamlike pictures, a man named Henri Rousseau was creating his own dreams. He made a famous painting called The Dream in 1910. This painting shows a woman who is very happy in a strange and wonderful place. But The Dream also shows Rousseau's own personal dreams and goals. He dreamed of being recognized and accepted by other artists and people who liked art.\n\nRousseau had a difficult problem. He wanted to be accepted by the art world, but he did not know how. He had to decide if he should copy the styles of other artists or be different and do his own painting. This was a big problem for him throughout his life.\n\nTo understand The Dream, we need to know a little about Rousseau's life. He was born on May 21, 1844, in a small town in northwest France. His father was a successful businessman who sold metal goods. Rousseau did not have any special training in art. Instead, he worked for the government until he was 40 years old. He then began to paint to help him feel better after the death of his wife and eight babies.\n\nRousseau wanted to be a good painter, but he had a big problem. Many other artists were better known and more famous than him. They had studied art for a long time and were very good at it. Rousseau, on the other hand, was self-taught and started painting late in life. He hoped that if he made good paintings, he would be accepted by the art world.\n\nRousseau was not like other artists who painted beautiful and romantic pictures of peasants. He painted simple and naive pictures of the world around him. He wanted to be accepted by the art world because he loved being an artist and wanted to be famous.\n\nSome people think it is not surprising that Rousseau wanted to be accepted by the art world. He was not a young man when he started painting, and he was competing with many other good artists. He did not get much recognition until the same time that another artist, Matisse, became famous.\n\nA writer named Jan Gordon said that Rousseau and Matisse were different in many ways. They painted different styles and subjects, and they had different reasons for painting. Rousseau wanted to make pictures that were so good that everyone would like them. Matisse wanted to make pictures that were new and exciting.",
            "Many famous thinkers think there is a strong connection between good behavior and beautiful things. I agree with them. I believe this connection exists because at a basic level, truth and beauty are the same. John Keats said it well in his poem \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\". He said, \"Beauty is truth, and that is all you need to know.\" We learn many things in life through education or experience, but we appreciate beauty and good behavior without being taught. We try to explain why something is beautiful or good, but we cannot make a rule for it.\n\nWe can't fully explain what makes something good or beautiful. When we talk about a famous painting or a good book, we use words like \"contrast\" and \"culture\". But these words don't say why it is good. When people talk about their favorite art or literature, they often say, \"There's just something about it.\" I think the same thing is true for good behavior and beauty. As the writer Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said in any other way.\" We can describe a book or painting, but there is still something more that we can't explain. I believe that good behavior is like this too.\n\nI think good behavior and beautiful things are connected because they affect us in the same way. We can feel them, but we can't fully explain them. This connection is even stronger when it comes to literature. Literature is special because it deals with values. As one writer said, \"Literature is important to us because of the values we find there.\" Living is about values, and literature is a part of that.",
            "Germany is a strong country today. It has a unique culture all the way from the Alps to the Baltic Sea. This culture is seen in many cities, like München, Köln, and Dresden. But Germany's culture comes from many different places and tribes. \n\nA long time ago, the land where Germans live today was called Germania. The name \"Germania\" is not clear. Some people think it came from a tribe called the Tungrians. Others think it came from a spear called a \"ger\". Another idea is that it came from an old Irish word meaning \"to shout\", because the Germans were loud.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote about the Germans in 98 AD. He said the Germans were the original people of the area. They did not come from other places. They lived in a difficult country with bad weather and strong people. The Romans did not like Germany and did not want to live there.\n\nThe Romans sent people to Germany to trade and fight. But they mostly stayed in their own country. The Germanic tribes started to appear in the 1st century AD. They lived near the Roman Empire and traded goods and skills with them.",
            "I stood there, looking at what was in front of me. My mind was empty. I did not think about anything. I just saw the picture in front of me. \n\nI once read a book on art. It was called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I wanted to learn how to draw when I was six years old. The book teaches people how to understand what they see. It says to draw a square around a picture to make it easy to see. \n\nI was looking at a bowl of fruit. It was on a table in a room. I wanted to see it as a simple picture, not a complicated one. But I could not. It was too much for me. I was amazed and I just looked. \n\nI wanted to be an artist. I wanted to make pictures like Picasso, Monet, and the artists from the Renaissance. My picture would be called \"Work in Brown.\" I picked up a pencil and tried to make a line. But my hand hit the toilet instead. I was trying to draw, but I was not very good. \n\nI looked at a piece of waste in the toilet. It was brown and it would not go down. I had to clean it up. I took a mop and stood up straight. I had to get rid of the waste. I dipped my hand into the toilet, like a mother cooking a turkey for Thanksgiving.",
            "Many young people die in car accidents. Several reasons make this a big problem for the youngest drivers in America. The National Institutes of Health say one reason is that the young brain is not ready for the dangers of driving. Teenagers also lack experience. This lack of experience causes many accidents, and more people are hurt or killed. They also drive too fast and drive off the road.\n\nTeenagers are often with friends when they drive. A study in California showed that the number of car accidents goes up when there are younger passengers. Some states try to make driving safer for teenagers by limiting the number of hours they can drive and not allowing younger passengers.\n\nI think these limits are not enough. The main problem is that teenagers, as a group, are not good at handling the dangers of driving. A psychologist says that 18 is too young to get a regular driver's license. He found that people under 20 often want to take risks for the fun of it. It makes sense to wait until they are older before letting them drive. If we continue to give driver's licenses to young teens, many more people will die in car accidents. In a few years, millions of new drivers will be on the road.\n\nWe can solve this problem with simple laws. Schools can teach driver's education to future drivers, but no one under 18 can drive a car. A special permit can be given before a full license, and people must practice driving with an adult for a certain number of hours. We can use the number of hours required in most states as a guide. The problem of teen drivers is the same all over the country, so a national law would be a good idea. It would help protect young people everywhere.\n\nThis idea is not new.",
            "I looked at movies from the Library of Congress. They are from a time before 1901. I wanted to see all of the films that were considered tricks. There were fifteen of these films. These films use special editing to look real. My study of these films is about how they were made and how they changed over time.\n\nMost of these films take place in one room. The camera does not move to follow the actors. This style came from the theater and vaudeville shows. The actors only move from side to side. They do not move towards or away from the camera. In one film called \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel,\" the actors enter from one side and move back and forth.\n\nThe camera does not get close to the actors. It stays far away, like it is in a theater. This is because the audience sees the whole show at one time. The actors do not move towards the camera, so we do not see close-ups. Each film is usually short, about a minute or less. They show short tricks, like magic. But sometimes one shot can be many photographs joined together to look like something is happening.\n\nOne film, \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots,\" looks like one shot. But if we look closely, we see where the shot changes. This is how some of these early films were made to look like magic.",
            "John Taylor was a strong supporter of the ideas of Republicanism.  He was a farmer, and this work, along with his short time in politics, made him known for his strong opinions on freedom and government.  Taylor thought that farming was the best job.  This idea affected his views on government, the law, and the courts.\n\nTaylor thought the United States had a good chance to create a perfect system of government.  There was no old tradition to follow, so the government could be made to allow people to control their own lives.  He believed that all people have rights that should be protected.  These rights are important to all people.  If one person's rights are not respected, all people's rights are in danger.\n\nTaylor said that in the early days of humanity, the strong and bad people had power.  But in a civilized society, this should not be the case.  He wanted a government that would control both good and bad things in people.  Taylor believed in two kinds of morality.  He said that government is like people, with both good and bad qualities.  He wanted a government based on good principles.  These principles would protect personal property, help farmers, and not support big business.  He thought a government based on good principles would be fair, even if its leaders are bad.\n\nTaylor wanted a strict reading of the Constitution.  He believed the government should only have the powers given to it in the Constitution.  He thought a big government is expensive and might be cruel.  But he also thought that a very simple reading of the Constitution could be bad, because it would not take into account the intentions of the people who wrote the Constitution.  Taylor thought the Declaration of Independence was the true rule of the United States.  This document clearly says the country is made up of many separate states, not one country.",
            "We look at Figure 17. There is a big drop in commuter log submissions in the third month. This is a little sad. We are not sure why it happens. Winter begins at our school in New England. Fewer people ride bicycles or walk. This might be a reason for the drop. In December, students are busy with schoolwork. They do not have time to fill out the log. This month also starts the holiday season. Students and teachers do not need to come to school for a long time. Classes start again in January. This might also be a reason for the low number of logs. But we still do not know why there are few logs in February.\n\nOne idea is that people get excited about a new project at first. Then, they get less interested. We created Carpool Challenge Week in March. This was a special campaign to make people more excited about the project. It worked. More people filled out the log in March.\n\nWe also had a problem because many people like to drive their cars. This is a big part of our culture. We gave out prizes to encourage people to use other ways to travel. We gave gift cards to restaurants, coffee shops, and stores. We wanted to see if bigger prizes would help more. It would have been great to give away a bicycle, a hybrid car, or an electric car. This might have helped people stay interested in the project. We did not change the prizes during the project. If we had announced bigger prizes in December and January, we think more people would have been interested.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a type of investment security.  It tracks an index, commodity or a group of assets.  This type of fund is like an index fund but is more flexible and trades like a stock on a stock exchange.  An ETF gives you the benefits of many investments and the freedom to sell short, buy with borrowed money and buy as few shares as one.  ETFs have some advantages.  They are cheaper than many other types of funds.  However, you must pay a fee for each trade.  There are many different kinds of ETFs to choose from.  Before investing, it is a good idea to check the benefits of an ETF carefully.  We will study the ETF IHF and compare it to the top 10 stocks that make up the ETF.  We want to know if owning one ETF is as good as owning a group of the individual stocks.\n\nWe will look at the top 10 stocks that make up 63.58% of the ETF.  These stocks are:\n\n[ Names and percentages of the top 10 stocks would go here ]\n\nTo understand how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF, we can calculate their effect on the overall return and risk of the ETF.  We use a special method to do this.  The results are in the chart below.\n\nFrom the chart, we can see that a group of just the top 10 stocks might earn a higher return and have less risk than the ETF.  However, there is a chance that these results are not real.  To understand this, we need to look at the risk of each stock.  We will look at how much each stock can change in value.  We will compare this to the risk of the ETF.\n\n[ Calculation of standard deviation of each stock and comparison to ETF standard deviation would go here ]",
            "Edgar Allan Poe was a great writer of poetry. His poem \"Dream-Land\" is one of his best. In this poem, Poe uses the word \"Thulé\" in two places. This word comes from the Roman writer Virgil. Virgil used it to mean an island north of Britain. He thought this island was the edge of the world.\n\nBut Poe got the word from another writer. His name was Goethe. Goethe was a German writer. Poe was very interested in Goethe's work. Goethe wrote a famous play called \"Faust\". It was published in two parts. The first part came out in 1808, and the second part came out the year Goethe died, in 1832.\n\nIn the second part of \"Faust\", there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé\". It is about a king who loses his wife. He cries and drinks a lot because he misses her. He decides to die and gives his things to his children. He throws a special cup into the ocean and dies.\n\nThe king in this poem and the king in Poe's \"Dream-Land\" are similar. They both have dark and sad feelings. Poe probably got the idea for \"Dream-Land\" from \"The King of Thule\". Poe liked to read and write about the same things as Goethe.\n\nPoe wrote about Thule in two of his poems. He said it was a place of darkness and loneliness. He said it was a place where you can hear the voices of dead friends. He said it was a world without color. This poem is like Goethe's poem \"The King of Thule\". In \"Dream-Land\", Poe wrote about a place that is like the one in Goethe's poem.\n\nGoethe was a famous writer. Poe respected him. Poe said he liked another writer named Tennyson. Poe probably met Goethe's work through Tennyson. Poe was exposed to Goethe's work many times. People were copying and publishing his work after it first came out.",
            "A customer in California slipped and fell on an applesauce spill in a grocery store. The customer, Jennifer Palmer, wants to get money from the store for her injuries. She claims the store manager, Paul Martin, acted with bad intention. Martin was told twice about the spill but did nothing to clean it up because he was eating dinner. \n\nA judge will not automatically throw out Palmer's claim for extra money. To get this extra money, Palmer must show that Martin was very careless and meant to cause harm. She also must show that his actions were very bad. Palmer can argue that Martin should have known a spill would cause problems. There were many accidents like this in the store in the past. Martin still did not take care of the problem.\n\nPalmer can say Martin's actions were very bad. This is because there were six slip-and-fall accidents in 2009 and Martin did not act to keep his store safe.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, an employee told Martin there was a spill. Martin said he was too busy eating dinner to help. Later, another employee told Martin about the spill. He said the same thing. Then, at 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and fell on the spill. She was hurt badly. Before her accident, there were five similar accidents in the store that year.\n\nPalmer is suing the store for her injury. She wants money for her injury and extra money as punishment. We are thinking about asking the judge to throw out the extra money part of her claim.\n\nIn California, people can get extra money if the other person acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Malice means acting with bad intention or doing something very bad on purpose. The law says that if someone is very careful and still does something wrong, it can be considered malice. A court has said that someone acts with malice if they know something bad will happen and they do nothing to stop it.",
            "I learned about Islam four years ago in a class at CBC.  The main topic of discussion was whether Islam is a hostile religion.  Now, the question is more important than ever.  I look back at what happened after 9/11.  The media had a bad view of Islam and its extreme followers.  But now, they show a lot of respect for Islam in America.  I do not think it is possible for America to elect a president like Barack Obama, who has Muslim family background, in 2001.\n\nThe story of the Prophet Muhammad is interesting to me.  What I know of his history does not match his personality.  From what I learned, Muhammad forced people to be Muslims.  He conquered tribes and made them be Muslim.  But his biography says he was a humble and kind person.  People came to him because they believed in his teachings.\n\nI see some similarities between the work of Jesus and the miracles of Muhammad.  One example is when Muhammad had some food and drink, and it was enough for many people.  The way this story is written makes me think the writers wanted people to see Muhammad as a kind and humble man who did not need to prove anything.  This makes me think they are not telling the truth about Jesus.\n\nThere are many stories in the biography that make it seem like people wanted to prove that Muhammad was a special person.  But some of these stories come from people who heard from others.  I did not like this because it makes the stories seem less true.\n\nI am concerned that the writers try to make Muhammad a good person.  But history says he was not a kind and humble man.  I wonder if Muslims know the real story of how Muhammad became powerful.",
            "Jesus' teachings were not part of Christian thought after his death. Instead, they moved away from his ideas. If we look at history, we see a pattern of Christianity moving farther from its start. Today, there is a growing movement to know more about Jesus and his ideas.  More people will study the history of Christianity and understand the true teachings of Jesus. They will try to separate the ideas that were added to Christianity over time from the original teachings of Jesus. It may take time, but eventually, people will go back to the original ideas. A movement will grow and remove the added ideas, one by one. This will be like moving the clock backward. When this happens, the church will be the leader. People will follow only Jesus' ideas, not the ideas added later. The church will be strong, but people will have more uniform ideas. They will be more alike instead of different. \n\nHistory shows us that things can change. For example, Christians were once persecuted. But later, the Roman Empire became Christian. Our country also improved from slavery to freedom. The same thing will happen to Christianity. People will go back to the teachings of Jesus. \n\nIt is also important to understand Jesus' words as metaphors, not as direct statements. This will help people move forward. If we look back in history, we see only the Jewish religion. The Jewish people divided into groups like Sadducees, Pharisees, and others. They had different ideas about God and the scriptures.",
            "The book The Jungle shows that human beings are naturally selfish. They want to improve their lives, but they do not care about others. The Jungle shows this in many ways. One example is the factory owners and managers. They want to make their factories big and successful. They do not care about people or animals that get hurt because of their actions.\n\nAccording to the author, Upton Sinclair, the factories are very damaging to the environment. He writes, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky...\" This shows the damage the factories are causing. The owners do not care about the smoke and pollution they create or the dirty water that comes from the animal pens.\n\nThe factory owners and managers also do not care about their workers. They want to make money, so they work their employees hard and without pay. They can lay off workers at any time. The workers had no protection during that time. The owners and managers were in control, and the workers were like slaves. The workers were poor and had no way to get help. Some workers even formed unions, but these groups often took money from the workers.\n\nThe Jungle shows that people are selfish and do not care about others. The book says that when people are treated very badly, they will act badly too. This is like the old system of slavery.",
            "Many authors use special writing methods to make readers feel a certain way about important subjects. \nSome methods are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these methods in his book The Great Gatsby. He uses words in special ways to make readers feel a certain way. For example, he pairs a color with a noun that do not usually go together. He uses many colors, including gold, green, white, gray, red, and pink.\n\nIn The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald gives special meanings to some colors. He uses white and gray to make readers feel a certain way about important things. He uses these colors in the beginning of the book to show that they are important. People in the book, like Daisy and Jordan, often wear white. They wear white clothes and look nice and clean. Fitzgerald uses colors like this in other parts of the book too. For example, he says that some people are \"gray\" and that some things are \"white.\" He uses these words to show that these people and things are not exciting or special.\n\nFitzgerald uses these colors to make readers think about the people and things in a certain way. He wants readers to see some people and things as boring or less important. For example, Fitzgerald does not use the colors white and gray for a long time, and then he describes Daisy as wearing white again. This makes readers see her as not special or interesting. He uses this method again to make readers see her as just a person that Gatsby wants.\n\nFitzgerald uses the colors white and gray to make readers feel a certain way about some people and things in his book. He wants readers to think about them in a certain way.",

People grow many crops there, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, and fruits like peaches and lemons. They also grow berries, honey, and peppers. Many people want to buy organic food from local farms. These farms have long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular.\n\nSome organic farms in San Diego give tours and let people walk on the land and watch birds. This is good for people who like nature. It helps the landowner and makes money for the farm. \n\nBut organic farming is more expensive than regular farming. It needs more work to kill pests and weeds and to make the soil healthy without using chemicals. The farm may lose more food. Small organic farms are not as efficient as big farms. They have to do more work to protect the environment.\n\nThe land in this example is in a place called Potrero, near a national forest. It is 160 acres of land with different types of plants and trees. Many plants and animals live there that are in danger. The government is working on a plan to protect them.\n\nFor a long time, people lived on this land. They were Native Americans and then cattle ranchers and wood sellers. The land was probably used for grazing and cutting wood.\n\nI looked at a real estate website and found a farm in the same area.

            "Culture is very important in any kind of negotiation. It is hard to define culture. Culture is not the same in all places. It is not just one thing. We should not say all people from a certain country are the same. For example, it is not true that all Russians are stubborn or all Japanese are accommodating. When we meet people from another culture, we can understand it better by comparing it to our own culture.\n\nTo know a foreign culture, we can learn about its history, its values, and its problems. We should not judge or try to change a culture. We should accept it as it is. This is especially true when we are in a weaker position in a negotiation. If we respect a culture, we can overcome any problems and move forward.\n\nCulture is not just about countries. Companies also have their own culture. Some companies work very hard, while others have a more relaxed schedule. We can see a company's culture in the way its employees dress, the way they communicate, and the way they hire people. Even in America, different companies have different cultures, and there is a lot of diversity in corporate culture.\n\nUnderstanding values is very important. Values tell us why a culture does things in a certain way. If a culture values saving face or harmony, a negotiator will not shame his company or his boss. If a culture values a hard bargain, a negotiator will not settle quickly. We should think about these things before we negotiate. But it is also good to learn about the other person's personality and values to be a good negotiator.",
            "There is an old saying: \"The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This quote is from the Bible and is also used by the famous thinker Thomas Aquinas. Both thinkers write about the same thing - the existence of God. We will compare their ideas. But first, we must assume that they are both right. If we don't, we cannot compare their ideas. What if they believed in a different kind of God? We will look at the idea of the God in the Bible.\n\nLet's start with St. Anselm. He says that we can know God exists by thinking about it. We can understand God by looking inside ourselves. He says that we cannot think about God not existing. This means that God exists in our minds. Anselm does not need outside evidence to prove God's existence. He believes that faith is enough. This idea is important in Christianity because it means that people can believe in God without proof.\n\nThomas Aquinas has a different idea. He thinks that we can prove God exists using logic and evidence. He does not need faith. This idea is good for spreading Christianity because people can be convinced by reason, not just faith. Aquinas writes about five reasons why God exists: change, cause and effect, things that depend on others, degrees of good and bad, and harmony. He says that these reasons show that God is necessary. If you are missing a piece of a puzzle, you can know what it looks like and that it exists without seeing it.",
            "A long time ago, in the fifth or sixth century, a prince was born. This man would one day be known as Buddha. He lived a long time and became a wise man. He gave up the world and found the answer to life. His teachings formed a new religion called Buddhism. This religion is over 2,500 years old.\n\nBuddhism is different now from what it was when Buddha was alive. This can be seen in Sri Lanka, a country where Theravada Buddhism is the main religion. In this country, a special ceremony happens every year. People cut water to mark the start of a special time. Monks and lay people do this together. This ceremony is important, but Buddha never taught about it.\n\nBuddhism has changed in many ways. This is true from the simple rules to the deeper meaning of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community has changed its rules over time. This is true for both monks and lay people. This change came from both inside and outside the community.\n\nWe need to know some words to talk about the changes in Buddhism. An \"internal force\" is a change that comes from inside the Buddhist community. An \"external force\" is a change that comes from outside the community. A \"hostile force\" is a change that hurts the Buddhist community. A \"benign force\" is a change that does not hurt the community, but it could have bad effects.\n\nNow, we need to look at the basics of Buddhism. Buddhists go to the triple gem for help. The triple gem is the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is the Buddhist text, which is divided into three parts. The Sutta Pitaka has the teachings of Buddha. The Vinaya Pitaka has the rules for living. The Abhidhamma Pitaka has the deeper meaning of Buddhism. These deeper meanings include no soul (Anatta), suffering (Dukkha), and everything changes (Anicca). If we understand these ideas, we can stop the cycle of death and rebirth, called Sansara. Sansara is a never-ending cycle of suffering, desire, hatred, and ignorance. When we become wise, we can leave this cycle behind. In the Vinaya Pitaka, there are rules for monks and lay people to follow. For lay people, there are five simple rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not be immoral, and do not take too much drink. For monks, there are many more rules. The main idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. First, life is suffering. Second, attachment causes suffering. Third, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico were once two countries with a long history of disagreement. This disagreement lasted 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. The United States and Mexico fought a war from 1846 to 1848. The US won the war and took control of Texas and parts of the American Southwest.\n\nThere were many other times when the two countries disagreed. But their disagreements started to decrease before World War One. The United States and Mexico disagreed over things like religion, culture, and traditions. They also disagreed over things like money and land.\n\nThis is not new. Many countries with shared borders disagree with each other. They often disagree over things like land and money. The US and Mexico are not the only countries with a long history of disagreement. Cuba is another country that has had many problems with the US.\n\nThe two countries were also divided by their beliefs about God. This created a problem between them. Many countries have had problems because of disagreements about God. In the past, the US was against Catholicism and a king. Now, the US is against things like fascism and communism.\n\nThe US and Mexico did not get along because of the way the English and Spanish treated them in the past. The English and Spanish had a lot of disagreements, and the US and Mexico inherited these feelings. This made it hard for the two countries to be friends.\n\nThere were 17 times when the US and Mexico disagreed between 1836 and 1893. Most of these disagreements were about land and border problems. Bandits and outlaws from the US would cross the border and cause problems in Mexico. But the situation started to improve when Mexico became dependent on the US. The US then started to help Mexico with its economy instead of trying to take its land.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became sick with an illness I never knew about. I was a nurse at that time. I chose to be a nurse for a safe and secure life. I wanted a safe life because I did not have one as a child. People told me, \"You will always find work. People will always get sick.\" I wanted to be a scientist or a journalist, but I chose nursing instead.\n\nNow, I am 46 years old. I have no money, and I am not able to work. I get help from Social Security. But it is hard. Every day is a struggle. I have to ask for help from my family and friends. They have been very kind to me.\n\nMy point is that bad things can happen in life. There is no guarantee that everything will go well. We all need help sometimes.\n\nI agree that the government is not perfect. We should not count on the government to help us all the time. But instead of just depending on the government, I think Americans should help each other. We should trust each other and share what we have.\n\nSome people say that America was built on individualism. But that is not true. Our ancestors helped each other when they were in trouble. They shared their food and their homes. They moved together in groups to the West.\n\nSo, be prepared for bad times. I have a kit with supplies like water, food, and a first aid kit. I also have a plan for a safe house. But the most important thing is to know your neighbors. Talk to them and help them when they need it.",
            "We want to know why living things change over time. Are there limits that affect how they change? In 1917, scientist D'Arcy Thompson said that it is difficult to explain the shape of living things in simple terms. But now, scientists are using math to study how some living things change over time. Our study is looking at how math can help us understand how living things change. We are studying a type of shellfish called Prunum. We are using math to help us understand how its shell changes.\n\nWe used special X-ray pictures to study the shapes of Prunum shells. We used these pictures to create math models. These models showed us what the shells might look like if they had changed in different ways. We are combining this math with experiments to learn more about how shells change over time.\n\nA shell is like a tube that grows over time. It grows in a spiral shape, with each part of the spiral called a whorl. The whorls are connected by a line called a suture. The last whorl, or body whorl, is the biggest part of the shell. The other parts are called the spire. The tip of the spire is called the apex, and the other end is called the base. The animal comes out of its shell through a hole called the aperture.\n\nWe can look at shells in different ways. We can look at the top, the bottom, or the front or back of the shell. The usual way to look at a shell is from the front, with the hole facing us and the tip pointing up.\n\nTo count the whorls, we look at the shell from the top. We draw a line where the first suture starts. Then we count the whorls from that line. We can count to a quarter of a whorl if we need to.\n\nA shell is like a path through time and space. It grows as the animal gets bigger. We can follow the path of the hole in the shell by looking at the center of each whorl and the size of the hole. We can use math to draw a picture of this path. This helps us understand how the animal's shell changes over time. We can use math to change the shell's shape and see what happens.",
            "For ten years, the number of newborn and baby deaths in Indonesia has not changed much.  The country is making progress in many areas, such as building clean water systems and improving sanitation.  But it is not making enough progress in taking care of mothers and babies.\n\nThere are several reasons for this.  One reason is that many women still give birth at home without a doctor or nurse present.  This can be very bad if there are problems during delivery.  Another reason is that many children with diarrhea are not getting the care they need.  We also do not have good information about how well new mothers are being taken care of after giving birth.\n\nOnly 4% of births in Indonesia are cesarean sections, which is a lower number than it should be.  The number of cesarean sections is higher in cities than in rural areas.  This means that people in rural areas are not getting the same level of healthcare as people in cities.  Another problem is that the rich have better access to healthcare than the poor.  This is because the poor have to pay out of their own pockets for medical care.\n\nTo fix these problems, we need to think about how to get more healthcare services to people who need them.  One way to do this is to focus on one area of healthcare at a time.  This can lead to quick results and easy-to-measure goals.  But there are some problems with this approach.  For example, if we put too much money and resources into one area, we may not have enough for other areas.  This can make it hard for people who work in healthcare to get the support they need.\n\nWe also need to consider the fact that running many programs at the same time can cause problems.  It can lead to unnecessary paperwork and make it hard to coordinate between programs.  This can make it hard to get the help that people need.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their detailed descriptions and focus on the aristocracy of that time. Two novels that are different from this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These novels use mystery and strange situations to make the characters more real and interesting. This helps readers understand their feelings and reasons for acting in certain ways.\n\nIn these novels, mystery is often shown through dream-like scenes or confusing situations. In Oliver Twist, these strange events help readers understand Oliver's feelings and what he is experiencing. \n\nIn one part of the book, Oliver has a dream or is in a dream-like state. He sees and hears things that did not really happen. It is like he is walking between two men who are arguing. The sounds of guns and loud voices make him feel pain and confuse him. He feels an unknown pain that does not go away. This shows that Oliver feels helpless and scared.\n\nIn another part of the book, Oliver has a nightmare about being shot. He remembers it like it was real. Even though he is in pain, he does not try to control the situation. He is not in charge of what is happening to him. This shows that Oliver feels defeated and does not know what to do.\n\nIn another novel, the day passes quickly. The night is very long and quiet, but it seems to end quickly. The author uses this to show the main character's feelings of sadness and confusion.",
            "I worked with students at an after-school program two years ago. I helped them with their school work, especially in English and reading. One boy, Adrian, had trouble reading. He spoke English well, but some letters were hard for him to read. I thought it was strange. We worked together, but then I met his mother. She did not speak English, only Spanish. We used simple words and gestures to talk. I then understood the problem: Adrian knew how to read, but not the English alphabet.\n\nI tell this story to show that a language barrier can be a big problem in school, especially in California. Even if a child speaks good English, reading can still be hard. I think we can all agree that this is a problem. So, what can we do? In Adrian's case, tutoring in English reading helped. But for children who do not speak much English, the solution is not simple.\n\nWe need a combination of things to solve this problem. Some people suggest a dual language system. This means teaching in two languages at the same time. We have found that children who learn in two languages do better in school. Some people are afraid that this idea is expensive and will not help most children. But this is not true. If we use this system more often, all children can benefit. But how can we do this? Do we need all teachers to speak two languages? No, this is not possible and not necessary. We can have extra help, like tutors or aids, who speak two languages.",
            "From a young age, people are told that something big is out there. We are bigger than we can understand. Some people go to school to learn about it. Others think about it themselves. Many people believe in the religions their parents tell them about. But some people do not believe. They think there is nothing beyond what they see and feel. People change their minds and think about other things. We all search for our own ideas about spirituality. We want to find a way to understand the world.\n\nI asked my father about his favorite bird. We sat on the front porch of our house. It was raining. We smoked cigarettes. He looked out into the rain. He seemed to be thinking about something. He was thin and sick. I wanted to talk to him, but I was afraid. I knew that talking about it would make it real.\n\nMy father died in December when I turned 22. He got treatment to stop his sickness, but it did not work. He was in a hospital for a few more months. I did not want to watch him die. I wanted to remember how he lived, not how he died. I knew my father better than anyone. I knew he would not have wanted me to watch him die. I stayed in my bed for three days. I waited for news.\n\nNo one called me.",
            "The Gothic Novel is a mix of old and new ideas. This is what Ian Watt calls an \"oxymoron,\" or a word that is a contradiction. The Gothic style has been both praised and criticized. Some people say it has no real depth, but others think it is a powerful way to express the \"terrible sublime.\"\n\nThe first Gothic Novel was written by Horace Walpole. It is called The Castle of Otranto. This book combined old and new ideas from romance stories. Walpole used old theatrical elements and new ways of writing to create a new kind of story. He called it \"A Gothic Story.\"\n\nThe Gothic style uses ideas from medieval times, like Gothic architecture and theater. Even when The Castle of Otranto was first published, the word \"Gothic\" was not used just to describe this style. It was used to describe many people, styles, and time periods. People thought it was old-fashioned and not modern.\n\nThe combination of old and new ideas in Gothic Novels is what makes them special. This is why they remain popular for a long time.\n\nOne important idea in Gothic Novels is the concept of chivalry. This idea is from medieval times. It is about the code of behavior for knights. In the first Gothic Novel, The Castle of Otranto, chivalry is used in a special way. The writer, Horace Walpole, wanted to show that society had lost its chivalrous values. He was writing during a time of great trouble in politics. He thought that the old values of chivalry were better than the morals of his time.\n\nThe character of Frederic in The Castle of Otranto is an example of this idea. He is a prince who has suffered a great loss. He is described as brave, courteous, and noble. These are all qualities of a chivalrous knight. Walpole uses these qualities to show what is missing in his society.\n\nThe Gothic style has been around for a long time. It is a mix of old and new ideas that continues to be popular today.",
            "Supply chain management is the process of moving goods from the customer to the final product. It includes the stages of raw materials, supply, production, and distribution. The term supply chain management was created in 1982 by a man named Keith Oliver. He described the process of planning, controlling, and organizing the supply chain to meet customer needs quickly and efficiently.\n\nThere are six main parts of a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers use these parts to give good service to customers.\n\nProduction is the first step in the supply chain. It is the base of the whole process. Managers decide what products to make and how many to make. They look at the market to see what customers want. The market helps them decide what products to make and how many.\n\nOnce managers decide what to make, they choose where to make it. They think about the quality and amount of products. They also think about customer needs. Then, they plan the work and take care of the equipment.\n\nProduction is an important step. Every detail is important. If one detail is not planned right, it can cost the company time and money. For example, companies like Wal-Mart and Target have a plan for every part of their business. They show how things should be done, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments. This helps the company work smoothly.\n\nThe second important part of the supply chain is supply. Supply means the company decides how to make things and who to work with. Companies may have many groups that make the same product. They decide which group is best for each part of the process. They may also work with other companies to make things. This helps the company be fast and flexible, and also saves money.",
            "A sign in Burma says Hitler is alive. Ellen Page, an actress, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of paper above her head. The sign has a bad message. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a country in Southeast Asia. A bad government controls Burma. In 1962, the government took power by force. In 2007, people in the street began to protest. Many monks led the protests. The protests were named the Saffron Revolution because of the color of the monks' robes. The government at first allowed the monks to gather, but soon the situation became very bad. The military attacked the monks and many monasteries. Journalists were arrested and some were killed. The government said only 13 people died, but a former soldier said many more died.\n\nThis is not new. Many governments have tried to stop people from disagreeing with them throughout history. In ancient times, Roman leaders said they were chosen by gods to rule. Some people believe that Japanese leaders are gods. The current U.S. president, George Bush, has meetings with a man who leads a group that does not like certain people.\n\nOne bad example is the Tiananmen Square protest in China in 1989. Many students, workers, and intellectuals protested against the government. The government said 200-300 people died, but others said between 2,000-3,000 people died. Another bad thing happened in Rwanda in the 1990s. Hutu groups and the government killed many people who were not like them. The Nazis, led by Hitler, also killed many people who were Jewish.",
            "Duke Ellington made a big impact on jazz music. He was a great composer and pianist who worked with his band for a long time. He was able to make each musician in the band sound good on their own and together they made music that was new and interesting.\n\nEllington was good at writing music that let musicians improvise and play freely. He also wrote music with strong structures that sounded good together. He knew how each musician played and how they fit together in the band. This helped him create some of the best music in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary talks about Ellington's special sound and how he was a pioneer in jazz. He used the human voice as a musical instrument in many of his songs. This was a new idea at the time. One of his early songs, Creole Love Call, is a good example of this. It is a slow and simple song with six parts:\n\nPart 1: The voice and the woodwind instruments talk to each other. The voice starts with a smooth sound and ends with a rough sound.\nPart 2: A trumpet player plays a solo with a lot of feeling and expression.\nPart 3: A clarinet player plays a fast and exciting solo with a piano playing a subtle rhythm in the background.\nPart 4: The whole band plays together and imitates the first part of the song.\nPart 5: The woodwind instruments take the lead and the brass section plays a strong rhythm.\nPart 6: The song goes back to the first part, with the voice playing like an instrument.\n\nEllington also used a special technique called the \"growl\" in this song. He was good at making his musicians sound good and he liked to experiment with new sounds and ideas.\n\nIn another song, Hot and Bothered, Ellington combined his skill at writing music with his ability to create new sounds. He used a trumpet player, Bubber Miley, and a singer, Baby Cox, to make a rich and interesting sound. In another song, It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), Ellington used a trombone player, Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, to introduce the melody in a special way.\n\nEllington was a master of using the human voice and other instruments to create new and exciting music. He was a true innovator in the world of jazz.",
            "She had a feeling that something was missing. This feeling was not going away. It started when she was 14 years old. Three years later, at 17, she still had this feeling. She decided she wanted to find someone to care about. But she did not feel interested in any boys. Some boys tried to talk to her, but she did not like them. She wondered why this was happening to her. She thought about this problem for a long time. She had some ideas, but they did not make sense.\n\nHer home was usually a peaceful place. Her parents were calm and nice. They did not fight with each other. They rarely argued with her. They argued about her wanting to be free and independent. She was the daughter of calm parents, but she was very outgoing and fun. She was a nice person.\n\nToday was not a calm day. She was looking for something to do when she heard a loud cry from the kitchen. Her mother was lying on the floor. She was hurting and saying \"ow\" many times. Her daughter rushed to her side. \"Mom, what's wrong?\" she asked. She saw her mother hurt. \"Ow, sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital,\" her mother said. Her daughter helped her up and drove her to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital smelled bad and was not a nice place. But her daughter was too worried to think about that.

            "This study shows that following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" helps reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke. The diet is known as the aMed diet. It is a special kind of Mediterranean diet. People who follow this diet eat a lot of plant foods, like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes. They also eat more monounsaturated fat and fish. They eat less animal products and saturated fat. A little bit of alcohol is allowed.\n\nPast studies have shown that following the Mediterranean diet can help people live longer and be healthier. They also found that this diet is better than a low-fat diet for losing weight and lowering cholesterol levels.\n\nThis study looked at 74,886 women who were 38 to 63 years old. They were all nurses and had never had heart disease or diabetes. The study lasted 20 years. The women answered food questionnaires six times to show what they ate. The researchers used these answers to create a score that showed how well they followed the aMed diet.\n\nThe researchers found that women who followed the aMed diet closely had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. They looked at how many women got heart disease or stroke over 20 years. They found that women who followed the diet closely had a 29% lower risk of heart disease and a 29% lower risk of stroke.\n\nThe researchers controlled for other factors that could affect the results, like age, smoking, weight, and exercise. They also looked at how much the women drank and how much aspirin they took. The results showed that following the aMed diet is good for women's heart health.",
            "In 2007, the United States had a big financial problem. Many people were without jobs, and the housing market crashed. Some of America's most important companies went out of business. This big problem continues today. We must ask: how did this happen, and how can we stop it? The answer is simple. The financial crisis was caused by bad and foolish decisions made by politicians. They forced banks and companies to give loans to people who could not pay them back. The banks did not have enough money to cover these loans. They sold these bad loans to other companies and to the public. When people could not pay their loans, the banks lost money and the economy got sick.\n\nThis financial problem started in 1999. President Clinton wanted to be elected for a second time. He wanted to be popular. To do this, he made it easier for people to get loans. He wanted more people to buy homes. This made it possible for banks to give loans to people who could not afford them. This was a big mistake.\n\nSteven Holmes, a reporter from the New York Times, wrote about this problem in 1999. He said that Fannie Mae, a company that helps people buy homes, was under pressure to give more loans to people who needed them. He also said that Fannie Mae might have problems if the economy got worse. And that's exactly what happened.\n\nMany factors combined to make the economy worse. Some people got loans that they could not afford to pay back. These loans were called adjustable-rate mortgages. They were like loans that got more expensive over time. People also got loans that were based on bad debts. This made the economy very weak. When the housing market crashed, the banks lost a lot of money. The top five investment banks in the United States had $4.1 trillion dollars of bad loans. This was 30% of the country's wealth. In the end, some of these banks went out of business. The government had to take control of Fannie and Freddie, two big companies that were in trouble.",
            "Exposition: the part of your story where you tell too much.  Dr. Merlin says this can be bad.  It can make readers fall asleep or press the \"Back\" button.\n\nThe rule \"Show, don't tell\" is well-known.  But Dr. Merlin still tells too much sometimes.  Exposition is like having a devil on your shoulder saying \"Tell them now!\" \n\nExposition means telling what happened.  In movies, this happens when one character tells another a lot of information.  In stories, the writer does the telling.\n\nHere is an example.  In a story, you might be told that a woman met her husband at a certain time and place.  They were married in a big ceremony.  Her husband was killed in front of her.  You would not want this to take a lot of pages.  You would want to know more about the husband and his wife.  You would want to see how they talked and acted to know how much they loved each other.  This would make you feel sad when he dies and care more about the woman.\n\nAs a writer, you need to add details.  It is tempting to rush through some parts.  For example, you might want to tell that a new character was in the Air Force and is now the night manager of a gas station.  He was married twice, has no children, and likes to fish.  But this might not be interesting to readers.  They might want to see how he acts and talks, not just what he does.",
            "I watched two news programs from NBC 4 in Columbus, Ohio. The first one was a live broadcast on August 13, 2011. The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who hurt his wife with a knife. The police had arrested him. They showed his picture. I think they spent the right amount of time on this story.\n\nThe second story was about a shooting in the Sharon Woods area. A young man named Travis Buyers was shot and is in serious condition. The police have not caught anyone yet. This story was short. I think it might be because the victim was a black man. I have noticed that when a white person is hurt or missing, the news covers it more. But when a minority person is hurt or missing, it gets less attention.\n\nThe next story was about a gunshot hole in a helicopter. The police think it happened in a certain area. A small bullet from a rifle hit the helicopter. The police are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for information that helps them catch the person who shot the helicopter.\n\nThe next story was about rain and thunderstorms on Saturday afternoon. The weather will be warm, around the mid-eighties. The news wanted to keep you watching.\n\nThey also covered a robbery at a store on Clime Road in Columbus. A black man with a hoodie robbed the store. He is about six feet tall and weighs about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they spent too much time saying he was black.\n\nThe next story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez. He was a big drug dealer. He was caught and will be in prison for twenty-five years. I am not sure why they said \"300 months\" instead of twenty-five years. They also mentioned he is a Hispanic man, but that is not important to the story.",
            "There is a special bond between brothers. This bond is strong and never breaks. Inside this bond are many feelings: love, pride, jealousy, and anger. Brothers know each other very well. They see themselves when they look at their brother. When a situation is very bad, the true nature of this bond appears. This bond can be good or bad. The emotions that come with it can be very costly. Understanding these emotions means dealing with their effects. When you look a brother in the eye and see yourself in them, you see how you really are. Your actions and their results show your true character.\n\nThe story \"The Scarlet Ibis\" shows this idea. Two brothers explore this theme and the strong emotions that come with it. They go on a journey through a beautiful and vivid place. Bitter disappointment and great pride meet in a big moment, and only one brother lives. The story shows this theme through the main character, Doodle, and how he behaves with his brother. It also shows this theme through the narrator, who helps us understand the main character's feelings and how he sees the world.\n\nThe main character's actions are all about one feeling: pride. From the start, he wanted a brother to teach him things like running and climbing trees. He wanted a brother to play with and be friends with. But his little brother, Doodle, was sick and could not do these things. This made the main character very sad and angry. He even thought about hurting Doodle. But when Doodle smiled at him, he felt happy and loved him. This shows that his anger was not as strong as he thought. He had a natural love for his brother.",
            "The brain is a very complicated system that processes information. A long time ago, people thought the brain was like a piece of wax. Later, they thought it was like a piece of paper called papyrus. Then, they thought it was like a book. Now, many people think it is like a computer. But the usefulness of these ideas is limited. They can lead to wrong conclusions.\n\nThe brain gets information from our senses. Our senses take in things like touch, heat, and light. They change this information into signals that the brain can understand. The brain works with this information in two ways. It looks at the information from the bottom up, and it looks at it from the top down. For example, when you look at a picture of a black box on a white background, the brain first looks at the color, shape, and edges of the box. Then, it uses this information to decide what you are seeing. The top-down process helps you understand what the box is.\n\nThe brain also decides which information is important. It uses a filter to decide what to pay attention to. For example, when you look at the grass near your shoes, your brain sees all the blades of grass. But you do not notice them unless you want to. Your brain is very good at focusing on what is important.\n\nThe brain stores information in different ways. There is sensory memory, which stores information for a short time. There is also working memory, which stores information for about 20 seconds. And there is long-term memory, which stores information for a long time. To store information, the brain must first change it into a form it can use. This is called encoding. For example, when you hear a word, the brain can encode it in different ways. It can encode the word based on how it looks, how it sounds, or what it means.\n\nThe brain is not fully understood. There are many models of how it works. Some models are based on how people remember things. Some are based on computers. And some are based on the brain's physical structure. One model says that the brain is like a network of connected ideas. For example, the idea of a chair might be connected to the idea of a table, which is connected to the idea of wood.",
            "Aldous Huxley writes about a bad future in his book Brave New World. He wants to show the dangers of modern technology and the way society is controlled by the government. In this future, people value being together in a group more than being individual. They are taught from a young age to be happy right now, not to think about the future or past. The people are like pawns in a game. They follow one way of thinking, which is controlled by the World Controller.\n\nHuxley's book is like a warning about the bad things that can happen when we follow a system like capitalism. He uses words from a philosophy called Marxism to show how this system can make people do things they don't want to do. For example, people in the lower classes do not know how the system works. They are brainwashed to want to buy things and be happy, but they do not think about the world around them. The people in charge control the lower classes and make them do what they want.\n\nIn Brave New World, the people do not have real relationships with each other. They do not have deep feelings or strong emotions. They only talk about surface things, like how someone looks. This shows that Huxley thinks that modern technology and capitalism can take away our freedom and make us lose our individuality.\n\nThe way people in the book accept their place in society is also like what Marx said would happen with capitalism. The lower classes are happy to be lower, and the upper classes do not care about changing the system. This is like a big problem in society. People are not free to think for themselves or feel deep emotions.\n\nHuxley's book is like a warning to us about the dangers of a system that controls people too much. He wants us to think about how we live and what we value.",

It was far from the center of campus. I had to walk a lot. It took 25 minutes to walk to class in Willard building. But it was often cold and rainy. The weather made it even harder to walk.\n\nI talked to an old friend. He said he used to like biking to campus. He stopped for a few years, but he thinks biking is the best way to get around. Biking is good for your body and it is fast. I live off campus now. My home is as far from campus as some dorms. I bought a bike and it has been a good decision. I go to Thomas building every day. It takes 5 minutes to ride my bike. But the road I take is not always safe.\n\nWalking is another option, but I am too busy. If I didn’t have a bike, I would have to walk every day. It would take 30-40 minutes. That is over two hours a week. I do not have that much time."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

The sociocultural model looks at how environment and society affect sleep. This report reviews studies that relate to these models and explains each one.\n\nInsomnia is a sleep problem. It can be caused by other mental problems or medical issues. There are different kinds of sleep disorders. Some are called Dyssonmias. These are problems with sleeping. Others are called Parasomnias. These are problems with behaving while sleeping.\n\nDyssonmias are problems with sleeping. They include insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, and other sleep problems. Insomnia is when you have trouble sleeping. Hypersomnia is when you have trouble staying awake. Narcolepsy is a problem with falling asleep suddenly.\n\nParasomnias are problems with behaving while sleeping. They include nightmares, sleepwalking, and other sleep problems. The biological model of sleep disorders looks at genetics and health. It also looks at how our bodies work. One study found that a special part of the brain called the hypothalamus helps us sleep and wake up. This part of the brain has special cells that help us sleep. If these cells do not work, we may have trouble sleeping.\n\nThe study used mice to test this theory. The mice had special receptors in their brains that helped them sleep. When these receptors were activated, the mice slept more. If they did not work, the mice were more awake. This study suggests that genetics and environment can affect our sleep. If we have a problem with these receptors, we may have trouble sleeping. This can affect our daily life, like going to school or work.\n\nThe sociocultural model looks at how environment and society affect sleep. If we inherit a problem with our sleep receptors, it could affect our sleep. This could cause problems in our daily life. We may have trouble focusing or performing tasks that need attention.",

For people with CAPD, the computer has a problem processing this information.\n\nThe idea of CAPD was first talked about in the 1950s. Researchers were trying to understand why some children had trouble with communication. In 1954, a team of researchers in Italy started testing children with this problem. They wanted to know how the brain processes sound. In 1961, another researcher came up with a way to test how the brain hears two sounds at the same time.\n\nCAPD is a complex problem. People with CAPD may have trouble:\n\n- Hearing sounds in space. For example, they may have trouble finding the source of a sound.\n- Distinguishing between two or more sounds.\n- Recognizing sound patterns. \n- Understanding changes in speech, like when someone says something with a sarcastic tone.\n- Blocking out one sound when another sound comes in.\n- Understanding the order of sounds.\n\nTo find out if someone has CAPD, doctors use tests. These tests look at how the person hears and reacts to sounds. They may use questionnaires, observe how the person behaves, and test their hearing. There is no single test that works for everyone. The tests may ask the person to listen to a series of words or numbers and separate them. More advanced tests record the sound waves in the ear and see how the person responds.\n\nTeachers can help students with CAPD in a classroom. They can make sure the student is close to the teacher when giving instructions, speak clearly and slowly, and use visual aids like pictures and gestures. They can also give the student extra time to understand and follow instructions.",
            "The play Twelfth Night says something important about lies and how people use them. Sometimes, lies can be helpful. But, in the end, people must stop lying or they can lose themselves forever. One problem with stopping a lie is that it can cause people to feel alone. They may choose between protecting themselves or their relationships with others. Some people may not be angry when they find out they were lied to. But others will be very upset.\n\nThe play makes us think about when people change their gender to pretend to be someone else. This is a big issue because it raises many questions. Why do people want to hide their real selves and pretend to be someone else? In the play, a woman named Viola wants to protect herself from harm. So, she pretends to be a man. This helps her, but it also makes her feel alone. She cannot talk to the women she knows because she is pretending to be a man. This makes things worse because the woman Olivia starts to love Viola, but thinks she is a man. Viola also has feelings for a man named Orsino, but she cannot express them because she is pretending to be a man.\n\nThe play shows how lying can help people understand their true feelings. Two characters, Olivia and Orsino, may have secret feelings for each other. But they do not know this until Viola, pretending to be a man, is around. This makes them think about their feelings. But it is not clear if Olivia really likes women or if she just likes the way Viola looks as a man.\n\nThe play shows that Olivia is easy to convince and can change her mind quickly. She starts to love another man, Sebastian, and then thinks of Viola as a family member, not a love interest. This makes us think that Olivia is not really interested in women, but rather likes to judge people by how they look.",
            "Many observers note that German colonial rule was very cruel. One example is the German treatment of the Ovaherero and Nama people in German South West Africa. German rule was not the same everywhere. The colonies had different policies and rulers. Education was also different in each colony. When the British took control of German East Africa in 1919, they found many educated and literate Africans. The Germans did a good job of teaching in Kamerun and other colonies, according to some writers.\n\nBut South West Africa, now called Namibia, was different. There, the government did not help much with native education. Instead, missionaries helped with education, but they got little help from the government. The government, however, spent a lot of money on schools for Europeans in the colony. They even helped and controlled the schools run by missionaries. These education policies had a big effect on South West Africa, even after Germany lost control. In South West Africa, most people did not learn to read or write. Various reasons, like social and economic problems, made South West Africa different from other German colonies. This paper will look at these reasons and study the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards African people.\n\nThere is much information about education in the German colonies. Most of this information is in German and was written a long time ago. These early writings described the education systems in the colonies. Later writings, in English, compared education in the different colonies and studied specific parts of education. These studies showed that the education systems in the colonies were very different. One important study, by Cohen, compares education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen says that the large number of settlers in South West Africa explains many of the differences in education.\n\nSouth West Africa had a good climate, but much of the land was a desert. The number of white people living in South West Africa was large. By 1913, almost 15,000 Europeans lived there. This was many more than the number of settlers in the colony with the next largest number, East Africa.",
            "Heavy metal music is a big group of music styles. It has grown a lot over 100 years. Now it is hard to make a complete list of all the different kinds. Most of these styles - like rock, country, and jazz - have smaller groups within them. Heavy metal rock is a very expressive style of music. It shows a wide range of feelings, but often they are sad or angry.\n\nHeavy metal started a long time ago. People soon saw that it was flexible and could be changed to make new kinds. These new kinds then split into even smaller groups. This keeps happening today.\n\nTo understand heavy metal music now, you need to understand where it comes from and what makes it different. Heavy metal is often a sad and dark kind of music. It has more loud instruments, more strong beats, and more dramatic sounds. The people who play heavy metal music are very good at playing their instruments.\n\nHeavy metal music is also connected to the use of drugs. In the past, people used psychedelic drugs to create new and crazy sounds. These sounds were very different from most popular music at the time. Later, new kinds of heavy metal music took some of these ideas from the past. Some songs express the sadness and anger that is common in heavy metal music. For example, the song \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles is a famous example of early heavy metal music. It is a fast, sad song about the effects of drugs. The Beatles wrote it to show that they could make heavy music like the Rolling Stones.",
            "Many years before the famous Surrealist artists started painting their dreamlike pictures, a man named Henri Rousseau was creating his own dreams. He made a famous painting called The Dream in 1910. This painting shows a woman who is very happy in a strange and wonderful place. But The Dream also shows Rousseau's own personal dreams and goals. He dreamed of being recognized and accepted by other artists and people who liked art.\n\nRousseau had a difficult problem. He wanted to be accepted by the art world, but he did not know how. He had to decide if he should copy the styles of other artists or be different and do his own painting. This was a big problem for him throughout his life.\n\nTo understand The Dream, we need to know a little about Rousseau's life. He was born on May 21, 1844, in a small town in northwest France. His father was a successful businessman who sold metal goods. Rousseau did not have any special training in art. Instead, he worked for the government until he was 40 years old. He then began to paint to help him feel better after the death of his wife and eight babies.\n\nRousseau wanted to be a good painter, but he had a big problem. Many other artists were better known and more famous than him. They had studied art for a long time and were very good at it. Rousseau, on the other hand, was self-taught and started painting late in life. He hoped that if he made good paintings, he would be accepted by the art world.\n\nRousseau was not like other artists who painted beautiful and romantic pictures of peasants. He painted simple and naive pictures of the world around him. He wanted to be accepted by the art world because he loved being an artist and wanted to be famous.\n\nSome people think it is not surprising that Rousseau wanted to be accepted by the art world. He was not a young man when he started painting, and he was competing with many other good artists. He did not get much recognition until the same time that another artist, Matisse, became famous.\n\nA writer named Jan Gordon said that Rousseau and Matisse were different in many ways. They painted different styles and subjects, and they had different reasons for painting. Rousseau wanted to make pictures that were so good that everyone would like them. Matisse wanted to make pictures that were new and exciting.",
            "Many famous thinkers think there is a strong connection between good behavior and beautiful things. I agree with them. I believe this connection exists because at a basic level, truth and beauty are the same. John Keats said it well in his poem \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\". He said, \"Beauty is truth, and that is all you need to know.\" We learn many things in life through education or experience, but we appreciate beauty and good behavior without being taught. We try to explain why something is beautiful or good, but we cannot make a rule for it.\n\nWe can't fully explain what makes something good or beautiful. When we talk about a famous painting or a good book, we use words like \"contrast\" and \"culture\". But these words don't say why it is good. When people talk about their favorite art or literature, they often say, \"There's just something about it.\" I think the same thing is true for good behavior and beauty. As the writer Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said in any other way.\" We can describe a book or painting, but there is still something more that we can't explain. I believe that good behavior is like this too.\n\nI think good behavior and beautiful things are connected because they affect us in the same way. We can feel them, but we can't fully explain them. This connection is even stronger when it comes to literature. Literature is special because it deals with values. As one writer said, \"Literature is important to us because of the values we find there.\" Living is about values, and literature is a part of that.",
            "Germany is a strong country today. It has a unique culture all the way from the Alps to the Baltic Sea. This culture is seen in many cities, like München, Köln, and Dresden. But Germany's culture comes from many different places and tribes. \n\nA long time ago, the land where Germans live today was called Germania. The name \"Germania\" is not clear. Some people think it came from a tribe called the Tungrians. Others think it came from a spear called a \"ger\". Another idea is that it came from an old Irish word meaning \"to shout\", because the Germans were loud.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote about the Germans in 98 AD. He said the Germans were the original people of the area. They did not come from other places. They lived in a difficult country with bad weather and strong people. The Romans did not like Germany and did not want to live there.\n\nThe Romans sent people to Germany to trade and fight. But they mostly stayed in their own country. The Germanic tribes started to appear in the 1st century AD. They lived near the Roman Empire and traded goods and skills with them.",
            "I stood there, looking at what was in front of me. My mind was empty. I did not think about anything. I just saw the picture in front of me. \n\nI once read a book on art. It was called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I wanted to learn how to draw when I was six years old. The book teaches people how to understand what they see. It says to draw a square around a picture to make it easy to see. \n\nI was looking at a bowl of fruit. It was on a table in a room. I wanted to see it as a simple picture, not a complicated one. But I could not. It was too much for me. I was amazed and I just looked. \n\nI wanted to be an artist. I wanted to make pictures like Picasso, Monet, and the artists from the Renaissance. My picture would be called \"Work in Brown.\" I picked up a pencil and tried to make a line. But my hand hit the toilet instead. I was trying to draw, but I was not very good. \n\nI looked at a piece of waste in the toilet. It was brown and it would not go down. I had to clean it up. I took a mop and stood up straight. I had to get rid of the waste. I dipped my hand into the toilet, like a mother cooking a turkey for Thanksgiving.",
            "Many young people die in car accidents. Several reasons make this a big problem for the youngest drivers in America. The National Institutes of Health say one reason is that the young brain is not ready for the dangers of driving. Teenagers also lack experience. This lack of experience causes many accidents, and more people are hurt or killed. They also drive too fast and drive off the road.\n\nTeenagers are often with friends when they drive. A study in California showed that the number of car accidents goes up when there are younger passengers. Some states try to make driving safer for teenagers by limiting the number of hours they can drive and not allowing younger passengers.\n\nI think these limits are not enough. The main problem is that teenagers, as a group, are not good at handling the dangers of driving. A psychologist says that 18 is too young to get a regular driver's license. He found that people under 20 often want to take risks for the fun of it. It makes sense to wait until they are older before letting them drive. If we continue to give driver's licenses to young teens, many more people will die in car accidents. In a few years, millions of new drivers will be on the road.\n\nWe can solve this problem with simple laws. Schools can teach driver's education to future drivers, but no one under 18 can drive a car. A special permit can be given before a full license, and people must practice driving with an adult for a certain number of hours. We can use the number of hours required in most states as a guide. The problem of teen drivers is the same all over the country, so a national law would be a good idea. It would help protect young people everywhere.\n\nThis idea is not new.",
            "I looked at movies from the Library of Congress. They are from a time before 1901. I wanted to see all of the films that were considered tricks. There were fifteen of these films. These films use special editing to look real. My study of these films is about how they were made and how they changed over time.\n\nMost of these films take place in one room. The camera does not move to follow the actors. This style came from the theater and vaudeville shows. The actors only move from side to side. They do not move towards or away from the camera. In one film called \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel,\" the actors enter from one side and move back and forth.\n\nThe camera does not get close to the actors. It stays far away, like it is in a theater. This is because the audience sees the whole show at one time. The actors do not move towards the camera, so we do not see close-ups. Each film is usually short, about a minute or less. They show short tricks, like magic. But sometimes one shot can be many photographs joined together to look like something is happening.\n\nOne film, \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots,\" looks like one shot. But if we look closely, we see where the shot changes. This is how some of these early films were made to look like magic.",
            "John Taylor was a strong supporter of the ideas of Republicanism.  He was a farmer, and this work, along with his short time in politics, made him known for his strong opinions on freedom and government.  Taylor thought that farming was the best job.  This idea affected his views on government, the law, and the courts.\n\nTaylor thought the United States had a good chance to create a perfect system of government.  There was no old tradition to follow, so the government could be made to allow people to control their own lives.  He believed that all people have rights that should be protected.  These rights are important to all people.  If one person's rights are not respected, all people's rights are in danger.\n\nTaylor said that in the early days of humanity, the strong and bad people had power.  But in a civilized society, this should not be the case.  He wanted a government that would control both good and bad things in people.  Taylor believed in two kinds of morality.  He said that government is like people, with both good and bad qualities.  He wanted a government based on good principles.  These principles would protect personal property, help farmers, and not support big business.  He thought a government based on good principles would be fair, even if its leaders are bad.\n\nTaylor wanted a strict reading of the Constitution.  He believed the government should only have the powers given to it in the Constitution.  He thought a big government is expensive and might be cruel.  But he also thought that a very simple reading of the Constitution could be bad, because it would not take into account the intentions of the people who wrote the Constitution.  Taylor thought the Declaration of Independence was the true rule of the United States.  This document clearly says the country is made up of many separate states, not one country.",
            "We look at Figure 17. There is a big drop in commuter log submissions in the third month. This is a little sad. We are not sure why it happens. Winter begins at our school in New England. Fewer people ride bicycles or walk. This might be a reason for the drop. In December, students are busy with schoolwork. They do not have time to fill out the log. This month also starts the holiday season. Students and teachers do not need to come to school for a long time. Classes start again in January. This might also be a reason for the low number of logs. But we still do not know why there are few logs in February.\n\nOne idea is that people get excited about a new project at first. Then, they get less interested. We created Carpool Challenge Week in March. This was a special campaign to make people more excited about the project. It worked. More people filled out the log in March.\n\nWe also had a problem because many people like to drive their cars. This is a big part of our culture. We gave out prizes to encourage people to use other ways to travel. We gave gift cards to restaurants, coffee shops, and stores. We wanted to see if bigger prizes would help more. It would have been great to give away a bicycle, a hybrid car, or an electric car. This might have helped people stay interested in the project. We did not change the prizes during the project. If we had announced bigger prizes in December and January, we think more people would have been interested.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a type of investment security.  It tracks an index, commodity or a group of assets.  This type of fund is like an index fund but is more flexible and trades like a stock on a stock exchange.  An ETF gives you the benefits of many investments and the freedom to sell short, buy with borrowed money and buy as few shares as one.  ETFs have some advantages.  They are cheaper than many other types of funds.  However, you must pay a fee for each trade.  There are many different kinds of ETFs to choose from.  Before investing, it is a good idea to check the benefits of an ETF carefully.  We will study the ETF IHF and compare it to the top 10 stocks that make up the ETF.  We want to know if owning one ETF is as good as owning a group of the individual stocks.\n\nWe will look at the top 10 stocks that make up 63.58% of the ETF.  These stocks are:\n\n[ Names and percentages of the top 10 stocks would go here ]\n\nTo understand how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF, we can calculate their effect on the overall return and risk of the ETF.  We use a special method to do this.  The results are in the chart below.\n\nFrom the chart, we can see that a group of just the top 10 stocks might earn a higher return and have less risk than the ETF.  However, there is a chance that these results are not real.  To understand this, we need to look at the risk of each stock.  We will look at how much each stock can change in value.  We will compare this to the risk of the ETF.\n\n[ Calculation of standard deviation of each stock and comparison to ETF standard deviation would go here ]",
            "Edgar Allan Poe was a great writer of poetry. His poem \"Dream-Land\" is one of his best. In this poem, Poe uses the word \"Thulé\" in two places. This word comes from the Roman writer Virgil. Virgil used it to mean an island north of Britain. He thought this island was the edge of the world.\n\nBut Poe got the word from another writer. His name was Goethe. Goethe was a German writer. Poe was very interested in Goethe's work. Goethe wrote a famous play called \"Faust\". It was published in two parts. The first part came out in 1808, and the second part came out the year Goethe died, in 1832.\n\nIn the second part of \"Faust\", there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé\". It is about a king who loses his wife. He cries and drinks a lot because he misses her. He decides to die and gives his things to his children. He throws a special cup into the ocean and dies.\n\nThe king in this poem and the king in Poe's \"Dream-Land\" are similar. They both have dark and sad feelings. Poe probably got the idea for \"Dream-Land\" from \"The King of Thule\". Poe liked to read and write about the same things as Goethe.\n\nPoe wrote about Thule in two of his poems. He said it was a place of darkness and loneliness. He said it was a place where you can hear the voices of dead friends. He said it was a world without color. This poem is like Goethe's poem \"The King of Thule\". In \"Dream-Land\", Poe wrote about a place that is like the one in Goethe's poem.\n\nGoethe was a famous writer. Poe respected him. Poe said he liked another writer named Tennyson. Poe probably met Goethe's work through Tennyson. Poe was exposed to Goethe's work many times. People were copying and publishing his work after it first came out.",
            "A customer in California slipped and fell on an applesauce spill in a grocery store. The customer, Jennifer Palmer, wants to get money from the store for her injuries. She claims the store manager, Paul Martin, acted with bad intention. Martin was told twice about the spill but did nothing to clean it up because he was eating dinner. \n\nA judge will not automatically throw out Palmer's claim for extra money. To get this extra money, Palmer must show that Martin was very careless and meant to cause harm. She also must show that his actions were very bad. Palmer can argue that Martin should have known a spill would cause problems. There were many accidents like this in the store in the past. Martin still did not take care of the problem.\n\nPalmer can say Martin's actions were very bad. This is because there were six slip-and-fall accidents in 2009 and Martin did not act to keep his store safe.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, an employee told Martin there was a spill. Martin said he was too busy eating dinner to help. Later, another employee told Martin about the spill. He said the same thing. Then, at 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and fell on the spill. She was hurt badly. Before her accident, there were five similar accidents in the store that year.\n\nPalmer is suing the store for her injury. She wants money for her injury and extra money as punishment. We are thinking about asking the judge to throw out the extra money part of her claim.\n\nIn California, people can get extra money if the other person acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Malice means acting with bad intention or doing something very bad on purpose. The law says that if someone is very careful and still does something wrong, it can be considered malice. A court has said that someone acts with malice if they know something bad will happen and they do nothing to stop it.",
            "I learned about Islam four years ago in a class at CBC.  The main topic of discussion was whether Islam is a hostile religion.  Now, the question is more important than ever.  I look back at what happened after 9/11.  The media had a bad view of Islam and its extreme followers.  But now, they show a lot of respect for Islam in America.  I do not think it is possible for America to elect a president like Barack Obama, who has Muslim family background, in 2001.\n\nThe story of the Prophet Muhammad is interesting to me.  What I know of his history does not match his personality.  From what I learned, Muhammad forced people to be Muslims.  He conquered tribes and made them be Muslim.  But his biography says he was a humble and kind person.  People came to him because they believed in his teachings.\n\nI see some similarities between the work of Jesus and the miracles of Muhammad.  One example is when Muhammad had some food and drink, and it was enough for many people.  The way this story is written makes me think the writers wanted people to see Muhammad as a kind and humble man who did not need to prove anything.  This makes me think they are not telling the truth about Jesus.\n\nThere are many stories in the biography that make it seem like people wanted to prove that Muhammad was a special person.  But some of these stories come from people who heard from others.  I did not like this because it makes the stories seem less true.\n\nI am concerned that the writers try to make Muhammad a good person.  But history says he was not a kind and humble man.  I wonder if Muslims know the real story of how Muhammad became powerful.",
            "Jesus' teachings were not part of Christian thought after his death. Instead, they moved away from his ideas. If we look at history, we see a pattern of Christianity moving farther from its start. Today, there is a growing movement to know more about Jesus and his ideas.  More people will study the history of Christianity and understand the true teachings of Jesus. They will try to separate the ideas that were added to Christianity over time from the original teachings of Jesus. It may take time, but eventually, people will go back to the original ideas. A movement will grow and remove the added ideas, one by one. This will be like moving the clock backward. When this happens, the church will be the leader. People will follow only Jesus' ideas, not the ideas added later. The church will be strong, but people will have more uniform ideas. They will be more alike instead of different. \n\nHistory shows us that things can change. For example, Christians were once persecuted. But later, the Roman Empire became Christian. Our country also improved from slavery to freedom. The same thing will happen to Christianity. People will go back to the teachings of Jesus. \n\nIt is also important to understand Jesus' words as metaphors, not as direct statements. This will help people move forward. If we look back in history, we see only the Jewish religion. The Jewish people divided into groups like Sadducees, Pharisees, and others. They had different ideas about God and the scriptures.",
            "The book The Jungle shows that human beings are naturally selfish. They want to improve their lives, but they do not care about others. The Jungle shows this in many ways. One example is the factory owners and managers. They want to make their factories big and successful. They do not care about people or animals that get hurt because of their actions.\n\nAccording to the author, Upton Sinclair, the factories are very damaging to the environment. He writes, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky...\" This shows the damage the factories are causing. The owners do not care about the smoke and pollution they create or the dirty water that comes from the animal pens.\n\nThe factory owners and managers also do not care about their workers. They want to make money, so they work their employees hard and without pay. They can lay off workers at any time. The workers had no protection during that time. The owners and managers were in control, and the workers were like slaves. The workers were poor and had no way to get help. Some workers even formed unions, but these groups often took money from the workers.\n\nThe Jungle shows that people are selfish and do not care about others. The book says that when people are treated very badly, they will act badly too. This is like the old system of slavery.",
            "Many authors use special writing methods to make readers feel a certain way about important subjects. \nSome methods are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these methods in his book The Great Gatsby. He uses words in special ways to make readers feel a certain way. For example, he pairs a color with a noun that do not usually go together. He uses many colors, including gold, green, white, gray, red, and pink.\n\nIn The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald gives special meanings to some colors. He uses white and gray to make readers feel a certain way about important things. He uses these colors in the beginning of the book to show that they are important. People in the book, like Daisy and Jordan, often wear white. They wear white clothes and look nice and clean. Fitzgerald uses colors like this in other parts of the book too. For example, he says that some people are \"gray\" and that some things are \"white.\" He uses these words to show that these people and things are not exciting or special.\n\nFitzgerald uses these colors to make readers think about the people and things in a certain way. He wants readers to see some people and things as boring or less important. For example, Fitzgerald does not use the colors white and gray for a long time, and then he describes Daisy as wearing white again. This makes readers see her as not special or interesting. He uses this method again to make readers see her as just a person that Gatsby wants.\n\nFitzgerald uses the colors white and gray to make readers feel a certain way about some people and things in his book. He wants readers to think about them in a certain way.",

People grow many crops there, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, and fruits like peaches and lemons. They also grow berries, honey, and peppers. Many people want to buy organic food from local farms. These farms have long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular.\n\nSome organic farms in San Diego give tours and let people walk on the land and watch birds. This is good for people who like nature. It helps the landowner and makes money for the farm. \n\nBut organic farming is more expensive than regular farming. It needs more work to kill pests and weeds and to make the soil healthy without using chemicals. The farm may lose more food. Small organic farms are not as efficient as big farms. They have to do more work to protect the environment.\n\nThe land in this example is in a place called Potrero, near a national forest. It is 160 acres of land with different types of plants and trees. Many plants and animals live there that are in danger. The government is working on a plan to protect them.\n\nFor a long time, people lived on this land. They were Native Americans and then cattle ranchers and wood sellers. The land was probably used for grazing and cutting wood.\n\nI looked at a real estate website and found a farm in the same area.

            "Culture is very important in any kind of negotiation. It is hard to define culture. Culture is not the same in all places. It is not just one thing. We should not say all people from a certain country are the same. For example, it is not true that all Russians are stubborn or all Japanese are accommodating. When we meet people from another culture, we can understand it better by comparing it to our own culture.\n\nTo know a foreign culture, we can learn about its history, its values, and its problems. We should not judge or try to change a culture. We should accept it as it is. This is especially true when we are in a weaker position in a negotiation. If we respect a culture, we can overcome any problems and move forward.\n\nCulture is not just about countries. Companies also have their own culture. Some companies work very hard, while others have a more relaxed schedule. We can see a company's culture in the way its employees dress, the way they communicate, and the way they hire people. Even in America, different companies have different cultures, and there is a lot of diversity in corporate culture.\n\nUnderstanding values is very important. Values tell us why a culture does things in a certain way. If a culture values saving face or harmony, a negotiator will not shame his company or his boss. If a culture values a hard bargain, a negotiator will not settle quickly. We should think about these things before we negotiate. But it is also good to learn about the other person's personality and values to be a good negotiator.",
            "There is an old saying: \"The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This quote is from the Bible and is also used by the famous thinker Thomas Aquinas. Both thinkers write about the same thing - the existence of God. We will compare their ideas. But first, we must assume that they are both right. If we don't, we cannot compare their ideas. What if they believed in a different kind of God? We will look at the idea of the God in the Bible.\n\nLet's start with St. Anselm. He says that we can know God exists by thinking about it. We can understand God by looking inside ourselves. He says that we cannot think about God not existing. This means that God exists in our minds. Anselm does not need outside evidence to prove God's existence. He believes that faith is enough. This idea is important in Christianity because it means that people can believe in God without proof.\n\nThomas Aquinas has a different idea. He thinks that we can prove God exists using logic and evidence. He does not need faith. This idea is good for spreading Christianity because people can be convinced by reason, not just faith. Aquinas writes about five reasons why God exists: change, cause and effect, things that depend on others, degrees of good and bad, and harmony. He says that these reasons show that God is necessary. If you are missing a piece of a puzzle, you can know what it looks like and that it exists without seeing it.",
            "A long time ago, in the fifth or sixth century, a prince was born. This man would one day be known as Buddha. He lived a long time and became a wise man. He gave up the world and found the answer to life. His teachings formed a new religion called Buddhism. This religion is over 2,500 years old.\n\nBuddhism is different now from what it was when Buddha was alive. This can be seen in Sri Lanka, a country where Theravada Buddhism is the main religion. In this country, a special ceremony happens every year. People cut water to mark the start of a special time. Monks and lay people do this together. This ceremony is important, but Buddha never taught about it.\n\nBuddhism has changed in many ways. This is true from the simple rules to the deeper meaning of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community has changed its rules over time. This is true for both monks and lay people. This change came from both inside and outside the community.\n\nWe need to know some words to talk about the changes in Buddhism. An \"internal force\" is a change that comes from inside the Buddhist community. An \"external force\" is a change that comes from outside the community. A \"hostile force\" is a change that hurts the Buddhist community. A \"benign force\" is a change that does not hurt the community, but it could have bad effects.\n\nNow, we need to look at the basics of Buddhism. Buddhists go to the triple gem for help. The triple gem is the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is the Buddhist text, which is divided into three parts. The Sutta Pitaka has the teachings of Buddha. The Vinaya Pitaka has the rules for living. The Abhidhamma Pitaka has the deeper meaning of Buddhism. These deeper meanings include no soul (Anatta), suffering (Dukkha), and everything changes (Anicca). If we understand these ideas, we can stop the cycle of death and rebirth, called Sansara. Sansara is a never-ending cycle of suffering, desire, hatred, and ignorance. When we become wise, we can leave this cycle behind. In the Vinaya Pitaka, there are rules for monks and lay people to follow. For lay people, there are five simple rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not be immoral, and do not take too much drink. For monks, there are many more rules. The main idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. First, life is suffering. Second, attachment causes suffering. Third, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico were once two countries with a long history of disagreement. This disagreement lasted 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. The United States and Mexico fought a war from 1846 to 1848. The US won the war and took control of Texas and parts of the American Southwest.\n\nThere were many other times when the two countries disagreed. But their disagreements started to decrease before World War One. The United States and Mexico disagreed over things like religion, culture, and traditions. They also disagreed over things like money and land.\n\nThis is not new. Many countries with shared borders disagree with each other. They often disagree over things like land and money. The US and Mexico are not the only countries with a long history of disagreement. Cuba is another country that has had many problems with the US.\n\nThe two countries were also divided by their beliefs about God. This created a problem between them. Many countries have had problems because of disagreements about God. In the past, the US was against Catholicism and a king. Now, the US is against things like fascism and communism.\n\nThe US and Mexico did not get along because of the way the English and Spanish treated them in the past. The English and Spanish had a lot of disagreements, and the US and Mexico inherited these feelings. This made it hard for the two countries to be friends.\n\nThere were 17 times when the US and Mexico disagreed between 1836 and 1893. Most of these disagreements were about land and border problems. Bandits and outlaws from the US would cross the border and cause problems in Mexico. But the situation started to improve when Mexico became dependent on the US. The US then started to help Mexico with its economy instead of trying to take its land.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became sick with an illness I never knew about. I was a nurse at that time. I chose to be a nurse for a safe and secure life. I wanted a safe life because I did not have one as a child. People told me, \"You will always find work. People will always get sick.\" I wanted to be a scientist or a journalist, but I chose nursing instead.\n\nNow, I am 46 years old. I have no money, and I am not able to work. I get help from Social Security. But it is hard. Every day is a struggle. I have to ask for help from my family and friends. They have been very kind to me.\n\nMy point is that bad things can happen in life. There is no guarantee that everything will go well. We all need help sometimes.\n\nI agree that the government is not perfect. We should not count on the government to help us all the time. But instead of just depending on the government, I think Americans should help each other. We should trust each other and share what we have.\n\nSome people say that America was built on individualism. But that is not true. Our ancestors helped each other when they were in trouble. They shared their food and their homes. They moved together in groups to the West.\n\nSo, be prepared for bad times. I have a kit with supplies like water, food, and a first aid kit. I also have a plan for a safe house. But the most important thing is to know your neighbors. Talk to them and help them when they need it.",
            "We want to know why living things change over time. Are there limits that affect how they change? In 1917, scientist D'Arcy Thompson said that it is difficult to explain the shape of living things in simple terms. But now, scientists are using math to study how some living things change over time. Our study is looking at how math can help us understand how living things change. We are studying a type of shellfish called Prunum. We are using math to help us understand how its shell changes.\n\nWe used special X-ray pictures to study the shapes of Prunum shells. We used these pictures to create math models. These models showed us what the shells might look like if they had changed in different ways. We are combining this math with experiments to learn more about how shells change over time.\n\nA shell is like a tube that grows over time. It grows in a spiral shape, with each part of the spiral called a whorl. The whorls are connected by a line called a suture. The last whorl, or body whorl, is the biggest part of the shell. The other parts are called the spire. The tip of the spire is called the apex, and the other end is called the base. The animal comes out of its shell through a hole called the aperture.\n\nWe can look at shells in different ways. We can look at the top, the bottom, or the front or back of the shell. The usual way to look at a shell is from the front, with the hole facing us and the tip pointing up.\n\nTo count the whorls, we look at the shell from the top. We draw a line where the first suture starts. Then we count the whorls from that line. We can count to a quarter of a whorl if we need to.\n\nA shell is like a path through time and space. It grows as the animal gets bigger. We can follow the path of the hole in the shell by looking at the center of each whorl and the size of the hole. We can use math to draw a picture of this path. This helps us understand how the animal's shell changes over time. We can use math to change the shell's shape and see what happens.",
            "For ten years, the number of newborn and baby deaths in Indonesia has not changed much.  The country is making progress in many areas, such as building clean water systems and improving sanitation.  But it is not making enough progress in taking care of mothers and babies.\n\nThere are several reasons for this.  One reason is that many women still give birth at home without a doctor or nurse present.  This can be very bad if there are problems during delivery.  Another reason is that many children with diarrhea are not getting the care they need.  We also do not have good information about how well new mothers are being taken care of after giving birth.\n\nOnly 4% of births in Indonesia are cesarean sections, which is a lower number than it should be.  The number of cesarean sections is higher in cities than in rural areas.  This means that people in rural areas are not getting the same level of healthcare as people in cities.  Another problem is that the rich have better access to healthcare than the poor.  This is because the poor have to pay out of their own pockets for medical care.\n\nTo fix these problems, we need to think about how to get more healthcare services to people who need them.  One way to do this is to focus on one area of healthcare at a time.  This can lead to quick results and easy-to-measure goals.  But there are some problems with this approach.  For example, if we put too much money and resources into one area, we may not have enough for other areas.  This can make it hard for people who work in healthcare to get the support they need.\n\nWe also need to consider the fact that running many programs at the same time can cause problems.  It can lead to unnecessary paperwork and make it hard to coordinate between programs.  This can make it hard to get the help that people need.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their detailed descriptions and focus on the aristocracy of that time. Two novels that are different from this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These novels use mystery and strange situations to make the characters more real and interesting. This helps readers understand their feelings and reasons for acting in certain ways.\n\nIn these novels, mystery is often shown through dream-like scenes or confusing situations. In Oliver Twist, these strange events help readers understand Oliver's feelings and what he is experiencing. \n\nIn one part of the book, Oliver has a dream or is in a dream-like state. He sees and hears things that did not really happen. It is like he is walking between two men who are arguing. The sounds of guns and loud voices make him feel pain and confuse him. He feels an unknown pain that does not go away. This shows that Oliver feels helpless and scared.\n\nIn another part of the book, Oliver has a nightmare about being shot. He remembers it like it was real. Even though he is in pain, he does not try to control the situation. He is not in charge of what is happening to him. This shows that Oliver feels defeated and does not know what to do.\n\nIn another novel, the day passes quickly. The night is very long and quiet, but it seems to end quickly. The author uses this to show the main character's feelings of sadness and confusion.",
            "I worked with students at an after-school program two years ago. I helped them with their school work, especially in English and reading. One boy, Adrian, had trouble reading. He spoke English well, but some letters were hard for him to read. I thought it was strange. We worked together, but then I met his mother. She did not speak English, only Spanish. We used simple words and gestures to talk. I then understood the problem: Adrian knew how to read, but not the English alphabet.\n\nI tell this story to show that a language barrier can be a big problem in school, especially in California. Even if a child speaks good English, reading can still be hard. I think we can all agree that this is a problem. So, what can we do? In Adrian's case, tutoring in English reading helped. But for children who do not speak much English, the solution is not simple.\n\nWe need a combination of things to solve this problem. Some people suggest a dual language system. This means teaching in two languages at the same time. We have found that children who learn in two languages do better in school. Some people are afraid that this idea is expensive and will not help most children. But this is not true. If we use this system more often, all children can benefit. But how can we do this? Do we need all teachers to speak two languages? No, this is not possible and not necessary. We can have extra help, like tutors or aids, who speak two languages.",
            "From a young age, people are told that something big is out there. We are bigger than we can understand. Some people go to school to learn about it. Others think about it themselves. Many people believe in the religions their parents tell them about. But some people do not believe. They think there is nothing beyond what they see and feel. People change their minds and think about other things. We all search for our own ideas about spirituality. We want to find a way to understand the world.\n\nI asked my father about his favorite bird. We sat on the front porch of our house. It was raining. We smoked cigarettes. He looked out into the rain. He seemed to be thinking about something. He was thin and sick. I wanted to talk to him, but I was afraid. I knew that talking about it would make it real.\n\nMy father died in December when I turned 22. He got treatment to stop his sickness, but it did not work. He was in a hospital for a few more months. I did not want to watch him die. I wanted to remember how he lived, not how he died. I knew my father better than anyone. I knew he would not have wanted me to watch him die. I stayed in my bed for three days. I waited for news.\n\nNo one called me.",
            "The Gothic Novel is a mix of old and new ideas. This is what Ian Watt calls an \"oxymoron,\" or a word that is a contradiction. The Gothic style has been both praised and criticized. Some people say it has no real depth, but others think it is a powerful way to express the \"terrible sublime.\"\n\nThe first Gothic Novel was written by Horace Walpole. It is called The Castle of Otranto. This book combined old and new ideas from romance stories. Walpole used old theatrical elements and new ways of writing to create a new kind of story. He called it \"A Gothic Story.\"\n\nThe Gothic style uses ideas from medieval times, like Gothic architecture and theater. Even when The Castle of Otranto was first published, the word \"Gothic\" was not used just to describe this style. It was used to describe many people, styles, and time periods. People thought it was old-fashioned and not modern.\n\nThe combination of old and new ideas in Gothic Novels is what makes them special. This is why they remain popular for a long time.\n\nOne important idea in Gothic Novels is the concept of chivalry. This idea is from medieval times. It is about the code of behavior for knights. In the first Gothic Novel, The Castle of Otranto, chivalry is used in a special way. The writer, Horace Walpole, wanted to show that society had lost its chivalrous values. He was writing during a time of great trouble in politics. He thought that the old values of chivalry were better than the morals of his time.\n\nThe character of Frederic in The Castle of Otranto is an example of this idea. He is a prince who has suffered a great loss. He is described as brave, courteous, and noble. These are all qualities of a chivalrous knight. Walpole uses these qualities to show what is missing in his society.\n\nThe Gothic style has been around for a long time. It is a mix of old and new ideas that continues to be popular today.",
            "Supply chain management is the process of moving goods from the customer to the final product. It includes the stages of raw materials, supply, production, and distribution. The term supply chain management was created in 1982 by a man named Keith Oliver. He described the process of planning, controlling, and organizing the supply chain to meet customer needs quickly and efficiently.\n\nThere are six main parts of a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers use these parts to give good service to customers.\n\nProduction is the first step in the supply chain. It is the base of the whole process. Managers decide what products to make and how many to make. They look at the market to see what customers want. The market helps them decide what products to make and how many.\n\nOnce managers decide what to make, they choose where to make it. They think about the quality and amount of products. They also think about customer needs. Then, they plan the work and take care of the equipment.\n\nProduction is an important step. Every detail is important. If one detail is not planned right, it can cost the company time and money. For example, companies like Wal-Mart and Target have a plan for every part of their business. They show how things should be done, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments. This helps the company work smoothly.\n\nThe second important part of the supply chain is supply. Supply means the company decides how to make things and who to work with. Companies may have many groups that make the same product. They decide which group is best for each part of the process. They may also work with other companies to make things. This helps the company be fast and flexible, and also saves money.",
            "A sign in Burma says Hitler is alive. Ellen Page, an actress, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of paper above her head. The sign has a bad message. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a country in Southeast Asia. A bad government controls Burma. In 1962, the government took power by force. In 2007, people in the street began to protest. Many monks led the protests. The protests were named the Saffron Revolution because of the color of the monks' robes. The government at first allowed the monks to gather, but soon the situation became very bad. The military attacked the monks and many monasteries. Journalists were arrested and some were killed. The government said only 13 people died, but a former soldier said many more died.\n\nThis is not new. Many governments have tried to stop people from disagreeing with them throughout history. In ancient times, Roman leaders said they were chosen by gods to rule. Some people believe that Japanese leaders are gods. The current U.S. president, George Bush, has meetings with a man who leads a group that does not like certain people.\n\nOne bad example is the Tiananmen Square protest in China in 1989. Many students, workers, and intellectuals protested against the government. The government said 200-300 people died, but others said between 2,000-3,000 people died. Another bad thing happened in Rwanda in the 1990s. Hutu groups and the government killed many people who were not like them. The Nazis, led by Hitler, also killed many people who were Jewish.",
            "Duke Ellington made a big impact on jazz music. He was a great composer and pianist who worked with his band for a long time. He was able to make each musician in the band sound good on their own and together they made music that was new and interesting.\n\nEllington was good at writing music that let musicians improvise and play freely. He also wrote music with strong structures that sounded good together. He knew how each musician played and how they fit together in the band. This helped him create some of the best music in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary talks about Ellington's special sound and how he was a pioneer in jazz. He used the human voice as a musical instrument in many of his songs. This was a new idea at the time. One of his early songs, Creole Love Call, is a good example of this. It is a slow and simple song with six parts:\n\nPart 1: The voice and the woodwind instruments talk to each other. The voice starts with a smooth sound and ends with a rough sound.\nPart 2: A trumpet player plays a solo with a lot of feeling and expression.\nPart 3: A clarinet player plays a fast and exciting solo with a piano playing a subtle rhythm in the background.\nPart 4: The whole band plays together and imitates the first part of the song.\nPart 5: The woodwind instruments take the lead and the brass section plays a strong rhythm.\nPart 6: The song goes back to the first part, with the voice playing like an instrument.\n\nEllington also used a special technique called the \"growl\" in this song. He was good at making his musicians sound good and he liked to experiment with new sounds and ideas.\n\nIn another song, Hot and Bothered, Ellington combined his skill at writing music with his ability to create new sounds. He used a trumpet player, Bubber Miley, and a singer, Baby Cox, to make a rich and interesting sound. In another song, It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), Ellington used a trombone player, Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, to introduce the melody in a special way.\n\nEllington was a master of using the human voice and other instruments to create new and exciting music. He was a true innovator in the world of jazz.",
            "She had a feeling that something was missing. This feeling was not going away. It started when she was 14 years old. Three years later, at 17, she still had this feeling. She decided she wanted to find someone to care about. But she did not feel interested in any boys. Some boys tried to talk to her, but she did not like them. She wondered why this was happening to her. She thought about this problem for a long time. She had some ideas, but they did not make sense.\n\nHer home was usually a peaceful place. Her parents were calm and nice. They did not fight with each other. They rarely argued with her. They argued about her wanting to be free and independent. She was the daughter of calm parents, but she was very outgoing and fun. She was a nice person.\n\nToday was not a calm day. She was looking for something to do when she heard a loud cry from the kitchen. Her mother was lying on the floor. She was hurting and saying \"ow\" many times. Her daughter rushed to her side. \"Mom, what's wrong?\" she asked. She saw her mother hurt. \"Ow, sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital,\" her mother said. Her daughter helped her up and drove her to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital smelled bad and was not a nice place. But her daughter was too worried to think about that.

            "This study shows that following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" helps reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke. The diet is known as the aMed diet. It is a special kind of Mediterranean diet. People who follow this diet eat a lot of plant foods, like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes. They also eat more monounsaturated fat and fish. They eat less animal products and saturated fat. A little bit of alcohol is allowed.\n\nPast studies have shown that following the Mediterranean diet can help people live longer and be healthier. They also found that this diet is better than a low-fat diet for losing weight and lowering cholesterol levels.\n\nThis study looked at 74,886 women who were 38 to 63 years old. They were all nurses and had never had heart disease or diabetes. The study lasted 20 years. The women answered food questionnaires six times to show what they ate. The researchers used these answers to create a score that showed how well they followed the aMed diet.\n\nThe researchers found that women who followed the aMed diet closely had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. They looked at how many women got heart disease or stroke over 20 years. They found that women who followed the diet closely had a 29% lower risk of heart disease and a 29% lower risk of stroke.\n\nThe researchers controlled for other factors that could affect the results, like age, smoking, weight, and exercise. They also looked at how much the women drank and how much aspirin they took. The results showed that following the aMed diet is good for women's heart health.",
            "In 2007, the United States had a big financial problem. Many people were without jobs, and the housing market crashed. Some of America's most important companies went out of business. This big problem continues today. We must ask: how did this happen, and how can we stop it? The answer is simple. The financial crisis was caused by bad and foolish decisions made by politicians. They forced banks and companies to give loans to people who could not pay them back. The banks did not have enough money to cover these loans. They sold these bad loans to other companies and to the public. When people could not pay their loans, the banks lost money and the economy got sick.\n\nThis financial problem started in 1999. President Clinton wanted to be elected for a second time. He wanted to be popular. To do this, he made it easier for people to get loans. He wanted more people to buy homes. This made it possible for banks to give loans to people who could not afford them. This was a big mistake.\n\nSteven Holmes, a reporter from the New York Times, wrote about this problem in 1999. He said that Fannie Mae, a company that helps people buy homes, was under pressure to give more loans to people who needed them. He also said that Fannie Mae might have problems if the economy got worse. And that's exactly what happened.\n\nMany factors combined to make the economy worse. Some people got loans that they could not afford to pay back. These loans were called adjustable-rate mortgages. They were like loans that got more expensive over time. People also got loans that were based on bad debts. This made the economy very weak. When the housing market crashed, the banks lost a lot of money. The top five investment banks in the United States had $4.1 trillion dollars of bad loans. This was 30% of the country's wealth. In the end, some of these banks went out of business. The government had to take control of Fannie and Freddie, two big companies that were in trouble.",
            "Exposition: the part of your story where you tell too much.  Dr. Merlin says this can be bad.  It can make readers fall asleep or press the \"Back\" button.\n\nThe rule \"Show, don't tell\" is well-known.  But Dr. Merlin still tells too much sometimes.  Exposition is like having a devil on your shoulder saying \"Tell them now!\" \n\nExposition means telling what happened.  In movies, this happens when one character tells another a lot of information.  In stories, the writer does the telling.\n\nHere is an example.  In a story, you might be told that a woman met her husband at a certain time and place.  They were married in a big ceremony.  Her husband was killed in front of her.  You would not want this to take a lot of pages.  You would want to know more about the husband and his wife.  You would want to see how they talked and acted to know how much they loved each other.  This would make you feel sad when he dies and care more about the woman.\n\nAs a writer, you need to add details.  It is tempting to rush through some parts.  For example, you might want to tell that a new character was in the Air Force and is now the night manager of a gas station.  He was married twice, has no children, and likes to fish.  But this might not be interesting to readers.  They might want to see how he acts and talks, not just what he does.",
            "I watched two news programs from NBC 4 in Columbus, Ohio. The first one was a live broadcast on August 13, 2011. The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who hurt his wife with a knife. The police had arrested him. They showed his picture. I think they spent the right amount of time on this story.\n\nThe second story was about a shooting in the Sharon Woods area. A young man named Travis Buyers was shot and is in serious condition. The police have not caught anyone yet. This story was short. I think it might be because the victim was a black man. I have noticed that when a white person is hurt or missing, the news covers it more. But when a minority person is hurt or missing, it gets less attention.\n\nThe next story was about a gunshot hole in a helicopter. The police think it happened in a certain area. A small bullet from a rifle hit the helicopter. The police are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for information that helps them catch the person who shot the helicopter.\n\nThe next story was about rain and thunderstorms on Saturday afternoon. The weather will be warm, around the mid-eighties. The news wanted to keep you watching.\n\nThey also covered a robbery at a store on Clime Road in Columbus. A black man with a hoodie robbed the store. He is about six feet tall and weighs about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they spent too much time saying he was black.\n\nThe next story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez. He was a big drug dealer. He was caught and will be in prison for twenty-five years. I am not sure why they said \"300 months\" instead of twenty-five years. They also mentioned he is a Hispanic man, but that is not important to the story.",
            "There is a special bond between brothers. This bond is strong and never breaks. Inside this bond are many feelings: love, pride, jealousy, and anger. Brothers know each other very well. They see themselves when they look at their brother. When a situation is very bad, the true nature of this bond appears. This bond can be good or bad. The emotions that come with it can be very costly. Understanding these emotions means dealing with their effects. When you look a brother in the eye and see yourself in them, you see how you really are. Your actions and their results show your true character.\n\nThe story \"The Scarlet Ibis\" shows this idea. Two brothers explore this theme and the strong emotions that come with it. They go on a journey through a beautiful and vivid place. Bitter disappointment and great pride meet in a big moment, and only one brother lives. The story shows this theme through the main character, Doodle, and how he behaves with his brother. It also shows this theme through the narrator, who helps us understand the main character's feelings and how he sees the world.\n\nThe main character's actions are all about one feeling: pride. From the start, he wanted a brother to teach him things like running and climbing trees. He wanted a brother to play with and be friends with. But his little brother, Doodle, was sick and could not do these things. This made the main character very sad and angry. He even thought about hurting Doodle. But when Doodle smiled at him, he felt happy and loved him. This shows that his anger was not as strong as he thought. He had a natural love for his brother.",
            "The brain is a very complicated system that processes information. A long time ago, people thought the brain was like a piece of wax. Later, they thought it was like a piece of paper called papyrus. Then, they thought it was like a book. Now, many people think it is like a computer. But the usefulness of these ideas is limited. They can lead to wrong conclusions.\n\nThe brain gets information from our senses. Our senses take in things like touch, heat, and light. They change this information into signals that the brain can understand. The brain works with this information in two ways. It looks at the information from the bottom up, and it looks at it from the top down. For example, when you look at a picture of a black box on a white background, the brain first looks at the color, shape, and edges of the box. Then, it uses this information to decide what you are seeing. The top-down process helps you understand what the box is.\n\nThe brain also decides which information is important. It uses a filter to decide what to pay attention to. For example, when you look at the grass near your shoes, your brain sees all the blades of grass. But you do not notice them unless you want to. Your brain is very good at focusing on what is important.\n\nThe brain stores information in different ways. There is sensory memory, which stores information for a short time. There is also working memory, which stores information for about 20 seconds. And there is long-term memory, which stores information for a long time. To store information, the brain must first change it into a form it can use. This is called encoding. For example, when you hear a word, the brain can encode it in different ways. It can encode the word based on how it looks, how it sounds, or what it means.\n\nThe brain is not fully understood. There are many models of how it works. Some models are based on how people remember things. Some are based on computers. And some are based on the brain's physical structure. One model says that the brain is like a network of connected ideas. For example, the idea of a chair might be connected to the idea of a table, which is connected to the idea of wood.",
            "Aldous Huxley writes about a bad future in his book Brave New World. He wants to show the dangers of modern technology and the way society is controlled by the government. In this future, people value being together in a group more than being individual. They are taught from a young age to be happy right now, not to think about the future or past. The people are like pawns in a game. They follow one way of thinking, which is controlled by the World Controller.\n\nHuxley's book is like a warning about the bad things that can happen when we follow a system like capitalism. He uses words from a philosophy called Marxism to show how this system can make people do things they don't want to do. For example, people in the lower classes do not know how the system works. They are brainwashed to want to buy things and be happy, but they do not think about the world around them. The people in charge control the lower classes and make them do what they want.\n\nIn Brave New World, the people do not have real relationships with each other. They do not have deep feelings or strong emotions. They only talk about surface things, like how someone looks. This shows that Huxley thinks that modern technology and capitalism can take away our freedom and make us lose our individuality.\n\nThe way people in the book accept their place in society is also like what Marx said would happen with capitalism. The lower classes are happy to be lower, and the upper classes do not care about changing the system. This is like a big problem in society. People are not free to think for themselves or feel deep emotions.\n\nHuxley's book is like a warning to us about the dangers of a system that controls people too much. He wants us to think about how we live and what we value.",
            "I am a student at University Park. I have been here for two and a half years. It is difficult for many students to get around campus. We have to walk or bike to class, but our campus is growing. The new buildings and apartments make it hard to find the best way to get to class.\n\nMy first year, I lived in East Halls. It was far from the center of campus. I had to walk a lot. It took 25 minutes to walk to class in Willard building. But it was often cold and rainy. The weather made it even harder to walk.\n\nI talked to an old friend. He said he used to like biking to campus. He stopped for a few years, but he thinks biking is the best way to get around. Biking is good for your body and it is fast. I live off campus now. My home is as far from campus as some dorms. I bought a bike and it has been a good decision. I go to Thomas building every day. It takes 5 minutes to ride my bike. But the road I take is not always safe.\n\nWalking is another option, but I am too busy. If I didn’t have a bike, I would have to walk every day. It would take 30-40 minutes. That is over two hours a week. I do not have that much time."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",

It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "This report is about two models that help us understand a sleep problem called insomnia. The biological model looks at genetics and health problems. The sociocultural model looks at how environment and society affect sleep. This report reviews studies that relate to these models and explains each one.\n\nInsomnia is a sleep problem. It can be caused by other mental problems or medical issues. There are different kinds of sleep disorders. Some are called Dyssonmias. These are problems with sleeping. Others are called Parasomnias. These are problems with behaving while sleeping.\n\nDyssonmias are problems with sleeping. They include insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, and other sleep problems. Insomnia is when you have trouble sleeping. Hypersomnia is when you have trouble staying awake. Narcolepsy is a problem with falling asleep suddenly.\n\nParasomnias are problems with behaving while sleeping. They include nightmares, sleepwalking, and other sleep problems. The biological model of sleep disorders looks at genetics and health. It also looks at how our bodies work. One study found that a special part of the brain called the hypothalamus helps us sleep and wake up. This part of the brain has special cells that help us sleep. If these cells do not work, we may have trouble sleeping.\n\nThe study used mice to test this theory. The mice had special receptors in their brains that helped them sleep. When these receptors were activated, the mice slept more. If they did not work, the mice were more awake. This study suggests that genetics and environment can affect our sleep. If we have a problem with these receptors, we may have trouble sleeping. This can affect our daily life, like going to school or work.\n\nThe sociocultural model looks at how environment and society affect sleep. If we inherit a problem with our sleep receptors, it could affect our sleep. This could cause problems in our daily life. We may have trouble focusing or performing tasks that need attention.",
            "Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) is a problem with the brain's ability to hear and understand sounds. People with CAPD can hear sounds clearly, but their brain has trouble making sense of them. The brain is like a computer that takes in information. For people with CAPD, the computer has a problem processing this information.\n\nThe idea of CAPD was first talked about in the 1950s. Researchers were trying to understand why some children had trouble with communication. In 1954, a team of researchers in Italy started testing children with this problem. They wanted to know how the brain processes sound. In 1961, another researcher came up with a way to test how the brain hears two sounds at the same time.\n\nCAPD is a complex problem. People with CAPD may have trouble:\n\n- Hearing sounds in space. For example, they may have trouble finding the source of a sound.\n- Distinguishing between two or more sounds.\n- Recognizing sound patterns. \n- Understanding changes in speech, like when someone says something with a sarcastic tone.\n- Blocking out one sound when another sound comes in.\n- Understanding the order of sounds.\n\nTo find out if someone has CAPD, doctors use tests. These tests look at how the person hears and reacts to sounds. They may use questionnaires, observe how the person behaves, and test their hearing. There is no single test that works for everyone. The tests may ask the person to listen to a series of words or numbers and separate them. More advanced tests record the sound waves in the ear and see how the person responds.\n\nTeachers can help students with CAPD in a classroom. They can make sure the student is close to the teacher when giving instructions, speak clearly and slowly, and use visual aids like pictures and gestures. They can also give the student extra time to understand and follow instructions.",
            "The play Twelfth Night says something important about lies and how people use them. Sometimes, lies can be helpful. But, in the end, people must stop lying or they can lose themselves forever. One problem with stopping a lie is that it can cause people to feel alone. They may choose between protecting themselves or their relationships with others. Some people may not be angry when they find out they were lied to. But others will be very upset.\n\nThe play makes us think about when people change their gender to pretend to be someone else. This is a big issue because it raises many questions. Why do people want to hide their real selves and pretend to be someone else? In the play, a woman named Viola wants to protect herself from harm. So, she pretends to be a man. This helps her, but it also makes her feel alone. She cannot talk to the women she knows because she is pretending to be a man. This makes things worse because the woman Olivia starts to love Viola, but thinks she is a man. Viola also has feelings for a man named Orsino, but she cannot express them because she is pretending to be a man.\n\nThe play shows how lying can help people understand their true feelings. Two characters, Olivia and Orsino, may have secret feelings for each other. But they do not know this until Viola, pretending to be a man, is around. This makes them think about their feelings. But it is not clear if Olivia really likes women or if she just likes the way Viola looks as a man.\n\nThe play shows that Olivia is easy to convince and can change her mind quickly. She starts to love another man, Sebastian, and then thinks of Viola as a family member, not a love interest. This makes us think that Olivia is not really interested in women, but rather likes to judge people by how they look.",
            "Many observers note that German colonial rule was very cruel. One example is the German treatment of the Ovaherero and Nama people in German South West Africa. German rule was not the same everywhere. The colonies had different policies and rulers. Education was also different in each colony. When the British took control of German East Africa in 1919, they found many educated and literate Africans. The Germans did a good job of teaching in Kamerun and other colonies, according to some writers.\n\nBut South West Africa, now called Namibia, was different. There, the government did not help much with native education. Instead, missionaries helped with education, but they got little help from the government. The government, however, spent a lot of money on schools for Europeans in the colony. They even helped and controlled the schools run by missionaries. These education policies had a big effect on South West Africa, even after Germany lost control. In South West Africa, most people did not learn to read or write. Various reasons, like social and economic problems, made South West Africa different from other German colonies. This paper will look at these reasons and study the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards African people.\n\nThere is much information about education in the German colonies. Most of this information is in German and was written a long time ago. These early writings described the education systems in the colonies. Later writings, in English, compared education in the different colonies and studied specific parts of education. These studies showed that the education systems in the colonies were very different. One important study, by Cohen, compares education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen says that the large number of settlers in South West Africa explains many of the differences in education.\n\nSouth West Africa had a good climate, but much of the land was a desert. The number of white people living in South West Africa was large. By 1913, almost 15,000 Europeans lived there. This was many more than the number of settlers in the colony with the next largest number, East Africa.",
            "Heavy metal music is a big group of music styles. It has grown a lot over 100 years. Now it is hard to make a complete list of all the different kinds. Most of these styles - like rock, country, and jazz - have smaller groups within them. Heavy metal rock is a very expressive style of music. It shows a wide range of feelings, but often they are sad or angry.\n\nHeavy metal started a long time ago. People soon saw that it was flexible and could be changed to make new kinds. These new kinds then split into even smaller groups. This keeps happening today.\n\nTo understand heavy metal music now, you need to understand where it comes from and what makes it different. Heavy metal is often a sad and dark kind of music. It has more loud instruments, more strong beats, and more dramatic sounds. The people who play heavy metal music are very good at playing their instruments.\n\nHeavy metal music is also connected to the use of drugs. In the past, people used psychedelic drugs to create new and crazy sounds. These sounds were very different from most popular music at the time. Later, new kinds of heavy metal music took some of these ideas from the past. Some songs express the sadness and anger that is common in heavy metal music. For example, the song \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles is a famous example of early heavy metal music. It is a fast, sad song about the effects of drugs. The Beatles wrote it to show that they could make heavy music like the Rolling Stones.",
            "Many years before the famous Surrealist artists started painting their dreamlike pictures, a man named Henri Rousseau was creating his own dreams. He made a famous painting called The Dream in 1910. This painting shows a woman who is very happy in a strange and wonderful place. But The Dream also shows Rousseau's own personal dreams and goals. He dreamed of being recognized and accepted by other artists and people who liked art.\n\nRousseau had a difficult problem. He wanted to be accepted by the art world, but he did not know how. He had to decide if he should copy the styles of other artists or be different and do his own painting. This was a big problem for him throughout his life.\n\nTo understand The Dream, we need to know a little about Rousseau's life. He was born on May 21, 1844, in a small town in northwest France. His father was a successful businessman who sold metal goods. Rousseau did not have any special training in art. Instead, he worked for the government until he was 40 years old. He then began to paint to help him feel better after the death of his wife and eight babies.\n\nRousseau wanted to be a good painter, but he had a big problem. Many other artists were better known and more famous than him. They had studied art for a long time and were very good at it. Rousseau, on the other hand, was self-taught and started painting late in life. He hoped that if he made good paintings, he would be accepted by the art world.\n\nRousseau was not like other artists who painted beautiful and romantic pictures of peasants. He painted simple and naive pictures of the world around him. He wanted to be accepted by the art world because he loved being an artist and wanted to be famous.\n\nSome people think it is not surprising that Rousseau wanted to be accepted by the art world. He was not a young man when he started painting, and he was competing with many other good artists. He did not get much recognition until the same time that another artist, Matisse, became famous.\n\nA writer named Jan Gordon said that Rousseau and Matisse were different in many ways. They painted different styles and subjects, and they had different reasons for painting. Rousseau wanted to make pictures that were so good that everyone would like them. Matisse wanted to make pictures that were new and exciting.",
            "Many famous thinkers think there is a strong connection between good behavior and beautiful things. I agree with them. I believe this connection exists because at a basic level, truth and beauty are the same. John Keats said it well in his poem \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\". He said, \"Beauty is truth, and that is all you need to know.\" We learn many things in life through education or experience, but we appreciate beauty and good behavior without being taught. We try to explain why something is beautiful or good, but we cannot make a rule for it.\n\nWe can't fully explain what makes something good or beautiful. When we talk about a famous painting or a good book, we use words like \"contrast\" and \"culture\". But these words don't say why it is good. When people talk about their favorite art or literature, they often say, \"There's just something about it.\" I think the same thing is true for good behavior and beauty. As the writer Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said in any other way.\" We can describe a book or painting, but there is still something more that we can't explain. I believe that good behavior is like this too.\n\nI think good behavior and beautiful things are connected because they affect us in the same way. We can feel them, but we can't fully explain them. This connection is even stronger when it comes to literature. Literature is special because it deals with values. As one writer said, \"Literature is important to us because of the values we find there.\" Living is about values, and literature is a part of that.",
            "Germany is a strong country today. It has a unique culture all the way from the Alps to the Baltic Sea. This culture is seen in many cities, like München, Köln, and Dresden. But Germany's culture comes from many different places and tribes. \n\nA long time ago, the land where Germans live today was called Germania. The name \"Germania\" is not clear. Some people think it came from a tribe called the Tungrians. Others think it came from a spear called a \"ger\". Another idea is that it came from an old Irish word meaning \"to shout\", because the Germans were loud.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote about the Germans in 98 AD. He said the Germans were the original people of the area. They did not come from other places. They lived in a difficult country with bad weather and strong people. The Romans did not like Germany and did not want to live there.\n\nThe Romans sent people to Germany to trade and fight. But they mostly stayed in their own country. The Germanic tribes started to appear in the 1st century AD. They lived near the Roman Empire and traded goods and skills with them.",
            "I stood there, looking at what was in front of me. My mind was empty. I did not think about anything. I just saw the picture in front of me. \n\nI once read a book on art. It was called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I wanted to learn how to draw when I was six years old. The book teaches people how to understand what they see. It says to draw a square around a picture to make it easy to see. \n\nI was looking at a bowl of fruit. It was on a table in a room. I wanted to see it as a simple picture, not a complicated one. But I could not. It was too much for me. I was amazed and I just looked. \n\nI wanted to be an artist. I wanted to make pictures like Picasso, Monet, and the artists from the Renaissance. My picture would be called \"Work in Brown.\" I picked up a pencil and tried to make a line. But my hand hit the toilet instead. I was trying to draw, but I was not very good. \n\nI looked at a piece of waste in the toilet. It was brown and it would not go down. I had to clean it up. I took a mop and stood up straight. I had to get rid of the waste. I dipped my hand into the toilet, like a mother cooking a turkey for Thanksgiving.",
            "Many young people die in car accidents. Several reasons make this a big problem for the youngest drivers in America. The National Institutes of Health say one reason is that the young brain is not ready for the dangers of driving. Teenagers also lack experience. This lack of experience causes many accidents, and more people are hurt or killed. They also drive too fast and drive off the road.\n\nTeenagers are often with friends when they drive. A study in California showed that the number of car accidents goes up when there are younger passengers. Some states try to make driving safer for teenagers by limiting the number of hours they can drive and not allowing younger passengers.\n\nI think these limits are not enough. The main problem is that teenagers, as a group, are not good at handling the dangers of driving. A psychologist says that 18 is too young to get a regular driver's license. He found that people under 20 often want to take risks for the fun of it. It makes sense to wait until they are older before letting them drive. If we continue to give driver's licenses to young teens, many more people will die in car accidents. In a few years, millions of new drivers will be on the road.\n\nWe can solve this problem with simple laws. Schools can teach driver's education to future drivers, but no one under 18 can drive a car. A special permit can be given before a full license, and people must practice driving with an adult for a certain number of hours. We can use the number of hours required in most states as a guide. The problem of teen drivers is the same all over the country, so a national law would be a good idea. It would help protect young people everywhere.\n\nThis idea is not new.",
            "I looked at movies from the Library of Congress. They are from a time before 1901. I wanted to see all of the films that were considered tricks. There were fifteen of these films. These films use special editing to look real. My study of these films is about how they were made and how they changed over time.\n\nMost of these films take place in one room. The camera does not move to follow the actors. This style came from the theater and vaudeville shows. The actors only move from side to side. They do not move towards or away from the camera. In one film called \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel,\" the actors enter from one side and move back and forth.\n\nThe camera does not get close to the actors. It stays far away, like it is in a theater. This is because the audience sees the whole show at one time. The actors do not move towards the camera, so we do not see close-ups. Each film is usually short, about a minute or less. They show short tricks, like magic. But sometimes one shot can be many photographs joined together to look like something is happening.\n\nOne film, \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots,\" looks like one shot. But if we look closely, we see where the shot changes. This is how some of these early films were made to look like magic.",
            "John Taylor was a strong supporter of the ideas of Republicanism.  He was a farmer, and this work, along with his short time in politics, made him known for his strong opinions on freedom and government.  Taylor thought that farming was the best job.  This idea affected his views on government, the law, and the courts.\n\nTaylor thought the United States had a good chance to create a perfect system of government.  There was no old tradition to follow, so the government could be made to allow people to control their own lives.  He believed that all people have rights that should be protected.  These rights are important to all people.  If one person's rights are not respected, all people's rights are in danger.\n\nTaylor said that in the early days of humanity, the strong and bad people had power.  But in a civilized society, this should not be the case.  He wanted a government that would control both good and bad things in people.  Taylor believed in two kinds of morality.  He said that government is like people, with both good and bad qualities.  He wanted a government based on good principles.  These principles would protect personal property, help farmers, and not support big business.  He thought a government based on good principles would be fair, even if its leaders are bad.\n\nTaylor wanted a strict reading of the Constitution.  He believed the government should only have the powers given to it in the Constitution.  He thought a big government is expensive and might be cruel.  But he also thought that a very simple reading of the Constitution could be bad, because it would not take into account the intentions of the people who wrote the Constitution.  Taylor thought the Declaration of Independence was the true rule of the United States.  This document clearly says the country is made up of many separate states, not one country.",
            "We look at Figure 17. There is a big drop in commuter log submissions in the third month. This is a little sad. We are not sure why it happens. Winter begins at our school in New England. Fewer people ride bicycles or walk. This might be a reason for the drop. In December, students are busy with schoolwork. They do not have time to fill out the log. This month also starts the holiday season. Students and teachers do not need to come to school for a long time. Classes start again in January. This might also be a reason for the low number of logs. But we still do not know why there are few logs in February.\n\nOne idea is that people get excited about a new project at first. Then, they get less interested. We created Carpool Challenge Week in March. This was a special campaign to make people more excited about the project. It worked. More people filled out the log in March.\n\nWe also had a problem because many people like to drive their cars. This is a big part of our culture. We gave out prizes to encourage people to use other ways to travel. We gave gift cards to restaurants, coffee shops, and stores. We wanted to see if bigger prizes would help more. It would have been great to give away a bicycle, a hybrid car, or an electric car. This might have helped people stay interested in the project. We did not change the prizes during the project. If we had announced bigger prizes in December and January, we think more people would have been interested.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a type of investment security.  It tracks an index, commodity or a group of assets.  This type of fund is like an index fund but is more flexible and trades like a stock on a stock exchange.  An ETF gives you the benefits of many investments and the freedom to sell short, buy with borrowed money and buy as few shares as one.  ETFs have some advantages.  They are cheaper than many other types of funds.  However, you must pay a fee for each trade.  There are many different kinds of ETFs to choose from.  Before investing, it is a good idea to check the benefits of an ETF carefully.  We will study the ETF IHF and compare it to the top 10 stocks that make up the ETF.  We want to know if owning one ETF is as good as owning a group of the individual stocks.\n\nWe will look at the top 10 stocks that make up 63.58% of the ETF.  These stocks are:\n\n[ Names and percentages of the top 10 stocks would go here ]\n\nTo understand how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF, we can calculate their effect on the overall return and risk of the ETF.  We use a special method to do this.  The results are in the chart below.\n\nFrom the chart, we can see that a group of just the top 10 stocks might earn a higher return and have less risk than the ETF.  However, there is a chance that these results are not real.  To understand this, we need to look at the risk of each stock.  We will look at how much each stock can change in value.  We will compare this to the risk of the ETF.\n\n[ Calculation of standard deviation of each stock and comparison to ETF standard deviation would go here ]",
            "Edgar Allan Poe was a great writer of poetry. His poem \"Dream-Land\" is one of his best. In this poem, Poe uses the word \"Thulé\" in two places. This word comes from the Roman writer Virgil. Virgil used it to mean an island north of Britain. He thought this island was the edge of the world.\n\nBut Poe got the word from another writer. His name was Goethe. Goethe was a German writer. Poe was very interested in Goethe's work. Goethe wrote a famous play called \"Faust\". It was published in two parts. The first part came out in 1808, and the second part came out the year Goethe died, in 1832.\n\nIn the second part of \"Faust\", there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé\". It is about a king who loses his wife. He cries and drinks a lot because he misses her. He decides to die and gives his things to his children. He throws a special cup into the ocean and dies.\n\nThe king in this poem and the king in Poe's \"Dream-Land\" are similar. They both have dark and sad feelings. Poe probably got the idea for \"Dream-Land\" from \"The King of Thule\". Poe liked to read and write about the same things as Goethe.\n\nPoe wrote about Thule in two of his poems. He said it was a place of darkness and loneliness. He said it was a place where you can hear the voices of dead friends. He said it was a world without color. This poem is like Goethe's poem \"The King of Thule\". In \"Dream-Land\", Poe wrote about a place that is like the one in Goethe's poem.\n\nGoethe was a famous writer. Poe respected him. Poe said he liked another writer named Tennyson. Poe probably met Goethe's work through Tennyson. Poe was exposed to Goethe's work many times. People were copying and publishing his work after it first came out.",
            "A customer in California slipped and fell on an applesauce spill in a grocery store. The customer, Jennifer Palmer, wants to get money from the store for her injuries. She claims the store manager, Paul Martin, acted with bad intention. Martin was told twice about the spill but did nothing to clean it up because he was eating dinner. \n\nA judge will not automatically throw out Palmer's claim for extra money. To get this extra money, Palmer must show that Martin was very careless and meant to cause harm. She also must show that his actions were very bad. Palmer can argue that Martin should have known a spill would cause problems. There were many accidents like this in the store in the past. Martin still did not take care of the problem.\n\nPalmer can say Martin's actions were very bad. This is because there were six slip-and-fall accidents in 2009 and Martin did not act to keep his store safe.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, an employee told Martin there was a spill. Martin said he was too busy eating dinner to help. Later, another employee told Martin about the spill. He said the same thing. Then, at 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and fell on the spill. She was hurt badly. Before her accident, there were five similar accidents in the store that year.\n\nPalmer is suing the store for her injury. She wants money for her injury and extra money as punishment. We are thinking about asking the judge to throw out the extra money part of her claim.\n\nIn California, people can get extra money if the other person acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Malice means acting with bad intention or doing something very bad on purpose. The law says that if someone is very careful and still does something wrong, it can be considered malice. A court has said that someone acts with malice if they know something bad will happen and they do nothing to stop it.",
            "I learned about Islam four years ago in a class at CBC.  The main topic of discussion was whether Islam is a hostile religion.  Now, the question is more important than ever.  I look back at what happened after 9/11.  The media had a bad view of Islam and its extreme followers.  But now, they show a lot of respect for Islam in America.  I do not think it is possible for America to elect a president like Barack Obama, who has Muslim family background, in 2001.\n\nThe story of the Prophet Muhammad is interesting to me.  What I know of his history does not match his personality.  From what I learned, Muhammad forced people to be Muslims.  He conquered tribes and made them be Muslim.  But his biography says he was a humble and kind person.  People came to him because they believed in his teachings.\n\nI see some similarities between the work of Jesus and the miracles of Muhammad.  One example is when Muhammad had some food and drink, and it was enough for many people.  The way this story is written makes me think the writers wanted people to see Muhammad as a kind and humble man who did not need to prove anything.  This makes me think they are not telling the truth about Jesus.\n\nThere are many stories in the biography that make it seem like people wanted to prove that Muhammad was a special person.  But some of these stories come from people who heard from others.  I did not like this because it makes the stories seem less true.\n\nI am concerned that the writers try to make Muhammad a good person.  But history says he was not a kind and humble man.  I wonder if Muslims know the real story of how Muhammad became powerful.",
            "Jesus' teachings were not part of Christian thought after his death. Instead, they moved away from his ideas. If we look at history, we see a pattern of Christianity moving farther from its start. Today, there is a growing movement to know more about Jesus and his ideas.  More people will study the history of Christianity and understand the true teachings of Jesus. They will try to separate the ideas that were added to Christianity over time from the original teachings of Jesus. It may take time, but eventually, people will go back to the original ideas. A movement will grow and remove the added ideas, one by one. This will be like moving the clock backward. When this happens, the church will be the leader. People will follow only Jesus' ideas, not the ideas added later. The church will be strong, but people will have more uniform ideas. They will be more alike instead of different. \n\nHistory shows us that things can change. For example, Christians were once persecuted. But later, the Roman Empire became Christian. Our country also improved from slavery to freedom. The same thing will happen to Christianity. People will go back to the teachings of Jesus. \n\nIt is also important to understand Jesus' words as metaphors, not as direct statements. This will help people move forward. If we look back in history, we see only the Jewish religion. The Jewish people divided into groups like Sadducees, Pharisees, and others. They had different ideas about God and the scriptures.",
            "The book The Jungle shows that human beings are naturally selfish. They want to improve their lives, but they do not care about others. The Jungle shows this in many ways. One example is the factory owners and managers. They want to make their factories big and successful. They do not care about people or animals that get hurt because of their actions.\n\nAccording to the author, Upton Sinclair, the factories are very damaging to the environment. He writes, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky...\" This shows the damage the factories are causing. The owners do not care about the smoke and pollution they create or the dirty water that comes from the animal pens.\n\nThe factory owners and managers also do not care about their workers. They want to make money, so they work their employees hard and without pay. They can lay off workers at any time. The workers had no protection during that time. The owners and managers were in control, and the workers were like slaves. The workers were poor and had no way to get help. Some workers even formed unions, but these groups often took money from the workers.\n\nThe Jungle shows that people are selfish and do not care about others. The book says that when people are treated very badly, they will act badly too. This is like the old system of slavery.",
            "Many authors use special writing methods to make readers feel a certain way about important subjects. \nSome methods are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these methods in his book The Great Gatsby. He uses words in special ways to make readers feel a certain way. For example, he pairs a color with a noun that do not usually go together. He uses many colors, including gold, green, white, gray, red, and pink.\n\nIn The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald gives special meanings to some colors. He uses white and gray to make readers feel a certain way about important things. He uses these colors in the beginning of the book to show that they are important. People in the book, like Daisy and Jordan, often wear white. They wear white clothes and look nice and clean. Fitzgerald uses colors like this in other parts of the book too. For example, he says that some people are \"gray\" and that some things are \"white.\" He uses these words to show that these people and things are not exciting or special.\n\nFitzgerald uses these colors to make readers think about the people and things in a certain way. He wants readers to see some people and things as boring or less important. For example, Fitzgerald does not use the colors white and gray for a long time, and then he describes Daisy as wearing white again. This makes readers see her as not special or interesting. He uses this method again to make readers see her as just a person that Gatsby wants.\n\nFitzgerald uses the colors white and gray to make readers feel a certain way about some people and things in his book. He wants readers to think about them in a certain way.",

People grow many crops there, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, and fruits like peaches and lemons. They also grow berries, honey, and peppers. Many people want to buy organic food from local farms. These farms have long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular.\n\nSome organic farms in San Diego give tours and let people walk on the land and watch birds. This is good for people who like nature. It helps the landowner and makes money for the farm. \n\nBut organic farming is more expensive than regular farming. It needs more work to kill pests and weeds and to make the soil healthy without using chemicals. The farm may lose more food. Small organic farms are not as efficient as big farms. They have to do more work to protect the environment.\n\nThe land in this example is in a place called Potrero, near a national forest. It is 160 acres of land with different types of plants and trees. Many plants and animals live there that are in danger. The government is working on a plan to protect them.\n\nFor a long time, people lived on this land. They were Native Americans and then cattle ranchers and wood sellers. The land was probably used for grazing and cutting wood.\n\nI looked at a real estate website and found a farm in the same area.

            "Culture is very important in any kind of negotiation. It is hard to define culture. Culture is not the same in all places. It is not just one thing. We should not say all people from a certain country are the same. For example, it is not true that all Russians are stubborn or all Japanese are accommodating. When we meet people from another culture, we can understand it better by comparing it to our own culture.\n\nTo know a foreign culture, we can learn about its history, its values, and its problems. We should not judge or try to change a culture. We should accept it as it is. This is especially true when we are in a weaker position in a negotiation. If we respect a culture, we can overcome any problems and move forward.\n\nCulture is not just about countries. Companies also have their own culture. Some companies work very hard, while others have a more relaxed schedule. We can see a company's culture in the way its employees dress, the way they communicate, and the way they hire people. Even in America, different companies have different cultures, and there is a lot of diversity in corporate culture.\n\nUnderstanding values is very important. Values tell us why a culture does things in a certain way. If a culture values saving face or harmony, a negotiator will not shame his company or his boss. If a culture values a hard bargain, a negotiator will not settle quickly. We should think about these things before we negotiate. But it is also good to learn about the other person's personality and values to be a good negotiator.",
            "There is an old saying: \"The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This quote is from the Bible and is also used by the famous thinker Thomas Aquinas. Both thinkers write about the same thing - the existence of God. We will compare their ideas. But first, we must assume that they are both right. If we don't, we cannot compare their ideas. What if they believed in a different kind of God? We will look at the idea of the God in the Bible.\n\nLet's start with St. Anselm. He says that we can know God exists by thinking about it. We can understand God by looking inside ourselves. He says that we cannot think about God not existing. This means that God exists in our minds. Anselm does not need outside evidence to prove God's existence. He believes that faith is enough. This idea is important in Christianity because it means that people can believe in God without proof.\n\nThomas Aquinas has a different idea. He thinks that we can prove God exists using logic and evidence. He does not need faith. This idea is good for spreading Christianity because people can be convinced by reason, not just faith. Aquinas writes about five reasons why God exists: change, cause and effect, things that depend on others, degrees of good and bad, and harmony. He says that these reasons show that God is necessary. If you are missing a piece of a puzzle, you can know what it looks like and that it exists without seeing it.",
            "A long time ago, in the fifth or sixth century, a prince was born. This man would one day be known as Buddha. He lived a long time and became a wise man. He gave up the world and found the answer to life. His teachings formed a new religion called Buddhism. This religion is over 2,500 years old.\n\nBuddhism is different now from what it was when Buddha was alive. This can be seen in Sri Lanka, a country where Theravada Buddhism is the main religion. In this country, a special ceremony happens every year. People cut water to mark the start of a special time. Monks and lay people do this together. This ceremony is important, but Buddha never taught about it.\n\nBuddhism has changed in many ways. This is true from the simple rules to the deeper meaning of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community has changed its rules over time. This is true for both monks and lay people. This change came from both inside and outside the community.\n\nWe need to know some words to talk about the changes in Buddhism. An \"internal force\" is a change that comes from inside the Buddhist community. An \"external force\" is a change that comes from outside the community. A \"hostile force\" is a change that hurts the Buddhist community. A \"benign force\" is a change that does not hurt the community, but it could have bad effects.\n\nNow, we need to look at the basics of Buddhism. Buddhists go to the triple gem for help. The triple gem is the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is the Buddhist text, which is divided into three parts. The Sutta Pitaka has the teachings of Buddha. The Vinaya Pitaka has the rules for living. The Abhidhamma Pitaka has the deeper meaning of Buddhism. These deeper meanings include no soul (Anatta), suffering (Dukkha), and everything changes (Anicca). If we understand these ideas, we can stop the cycle of death and rebirth, called Sansara. Sansara is a never-ending cycle of suffering, desire, hatred, and ignorance. When we become wise, we can leave this cycle behind. In the Vinaya Pitaka, there are rules for monks and lay people to follow. For lay people, there are five simple rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not be immoral, and do not take too much drink. For monks, there are many more rules. The main idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. First, life is suffering. Second, attachment causes suffering. Third, suffering can be overcome.",

But their disagreements started to decrease before World War One. The United States and Mexico disagreed over things like religion, culture, and traditions. They also disagreed over things like money and land.\n\nThis is not new. Many countries with shared borders disagree with each other. They often disagree over things like land and money. The US and Mexico are not the only countries with a long history of disagreement. Cuba is another country that has had many problems with the US.\n\nThe two countries were also divided by their beliefs about God. This created a problem between them. Many countries have had problems because of disagreements about God. In the past, the US was against Catholicism and a king. Now, the US is against things like fascism and communism.\n\nThe US and Mexico did not get along because of the way the English and Spanish treated them in the past. The English and Spanish had a lot of disagreements, and the US and Mexico inherited these feelings. This made it hard for the two countries to be friends.\n\nThere were 17 times when the US and Mexico disagreed between 1836 and 1893. Most of these disagreements were about land and border problems. Bandits and outlaws from the US would cross the border and cause problems in Mexico. But the situation started to improve when Mexico became dependent on the US. The US then started to help Mexico with its economy instead of trying to take its land.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became sick with an illness I never knew about. I was a nurse at that time. I chose to be a nurse for a safe and secure life. I wanted a safe life because I did not have one as a child. People told me, \"You will always find work. People will always get sick.\" I wanted to be a scientist or a journalist, but I chose nursing instead.\n\nNow, I am 46 years old. I have no money, and I am not able to work. I get help from Social Security. But it is hard. Every day is a struggle. I have to ask for help from my family and friends. They have been very kind to me.\n\nMy point is that bad things can happen in life. There is no guarantee that everything will go well. We all need help sometimes.\n\nI agree that the government is not perfect. We should not count on the government to help us all the time. But instead of just depending on the government, I think Americans should help each other. We should trust each other and share what we have.\n\nSome people say that America was built on individualism. But that is not true. Our ancestors helped each other when they were in trouble. They shared their food and their homes. They moved together in groups to the West.\n\nSo, be prepared for bad times. I have a kit with supplies like water, food, and a first aid kit. I also have a plan for a safe house. But the most important thing is to know your neighbors. Talk to them and help them when they need it.",
            "We want to know why living things change over time. Are there limits that affect how they change? In 1917, scientist D'Arcy Thompson said that it is difficult to explain the shape of living things in simple terms. But now, scientists are using math to study how some living things change over time. Our study is looking at how math can help us understand how living things change. We are studying a type of shellfish called Prunum. We are using math to help us understand how its shell changes.\n\nWe used special X-ray pictures to study the shapes of Prunum shells. We used these pictures to create math models. These models showed us what the shells might look like if they had changed in different ways. We are combining this math with experiments to learn more about how shells change over time.\n\nA shell is like a tube that grows over time. It grows in a spiral shape, with each part of the spiral called a whorl. The whorls are connected by a line called a suture. The last whorl, or body whorl, is the biggest part of the shell. The other parts are called the spire. The tip of the spire is called the apex, and the other end is called the base. The animal comes out of its shell through a hole called the aperture.\n\nWe can look at shells in different ways. We can look at the top, the bottom, or the front or back of the shell. The usual way to look at a shell is from the front, with the hole facing us and the tip pointing up.\n\nTo count the whorls, we look at the shell from the top. We draw a line where the first suture starts. Then we count the whorls from that line. We can count to a quarter of a whorl if we need to.\n\nA shell is like a path through time and space. It grows as the animal gets bigger. We can follow the path of the hole in the shell by looking at the center of each whorl and the size of the hole. We can use math to draw a picture of this path. This helps us understand how the animal's shell changes over time. We can use math to change the shell's shape and see what happens.",
            "For ten years, the number of newborn and baby deaths in Indonesia has not changed much.  The country is making progress in many areas, such as building clean water systems and improving sanitation.  But it is not making enough progress in taking care of mothers and babies.\n\nThere are several reasons for this.  One reason is that many women still give birth at home without a doctor or nurse present.  This can be very bad if there are problems during delivery.  Another reason is that many children with diarrhea are not getting the care they need.  We also do not have good information about how well new mothers are being taken care of after giving birth.\n\nOnly 4% of births in Indonesia are cesarean sections, which is a lower number than it should be.  The number of cesarean sections is higher in cities than in rural areas.  This means that people in rural areas are not getting the same level of healthcare as people in cities.  Another problem is that the rich have better access to healthcare than the poor.  This is because the poor have to pay out of their own pockets for medical care.\n\nTo fix these problems, we need to think about how to get more healthcare services to people who need them.  One way to do this is to focus on one area of healthcare at a time.  This can lead to quick results and easy-to-measure goals.  But there are some problems with this approach.  For example, if we put too much money and resources into one area, we may not have enough for other areas.  This can make it hard for people who work in healthcare to get the support they need.\n\nWe also need to consider the fact that running many programs at the same time can cause problems.  It can lead to unnecessary paperwork and make it hard to coordinate between programs.  This can make it hard to get the help that people need.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their detailed descriptions and focus on the aristocracy of that time. Two novels that are different from this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These novels use mystery and strange situations to make the characters more real and interesting. This helps readers understand their feelings and reasons for acting in certain ways.\n\nIn these novels, mystery is often shown through dream-like scenes or confusing situations. In Oliver Twist, these strange events help readers understand Oliver's feelings and what he is experiencing. \n\nIn one part of the book, Oliver has a dream or is in a dream-like state. He sees and hears things that did not really happen. It is like he is walking between two men who are arguing. The sounds of guns and loud voices make him feel pain and confuse him. He feels an unknown pain that does not go away. This shows that Oliver feels helpless and scared.\n\nIn another part of the book, Oliver has a nightmare about being shot. He remembers it like it was real. Even though he is in pain, he does not try to control the situation. He is not in charge of what is happening to him. This shows that Oliver feels defeated and does not know what to do.\n\nIn another novel, the day passes quickly. The night is very long and quiet, but it seems to end quickly. The author uses this to show the main character's feelings of sadness and confusion.",
            "I worked with students at an after-school program two years ago. I helped them with their school work, especially in English and reading. One boy, Adrian, had trouble reading. He spoke English well, but some letters were hard for him to read. I thought it was strange. We worked together, but then I met his mother. She did not speak English, only Spanish. We used simple words and gestures to talk. I then understood the problem: Adrian knew how to read, but not the English alphabet.\n\nI tell this story to show that a language barrier can be a big problem in school, especially in California. Even if a child speaks good English, reading can still be hard. I think we can all agree that this is a problem. So, what can we do? In Adrian's case, tutoring in English reading helped. But for children who do not speak much English, the solution is not simple.\n\nWe need a combination of things to solve this problem. Some people suggest a dual language system. This means teaching in two languages at the same time. We have found that children who learn in two languages do better in school. Some people are afraid that this idea is expensive and will not help most children. But this is not true. If we use this system more often, all children can benefit. But how can we do this? Do we need all teachers to speak two languages? No, this is not possible and not necessary. We can have extra help, like tutors or aids, who speak two languages.",
            "From a young age, people are told that something big is out there. We are bigger than we can understand. Some people go to school to learn about it. Others think about it themselves. Many people believe in the religions their parents tell them about. But some people do not believe. They think there is nothing beyond what they see and feel. People change their minds and think about other things. We all search for our own ideas about spirituality. We want to find a way to understand the world.\n\nI asked my father about his favorite bird. We sat on the front porch of our house. It was raining. We smoked cigarettes. He looked out into the rain. He seemed to be thinking about something. He was thin and sick. I wanted to talk to him, but I was afraid. I knew that talking about it would make it real.\n\nMy father died in December when I turned 22. He got treatment to stop his sickness, but it did not work. He was in a hospital for a few more months. I did not want to watch him die. I wanted to remember how he lived, not how he died. I knew my father better than anyone. I knew he would not have wanted me to watch him die. I stayed in my bed for three days. I waited for news.\n\nNo one called me.",
            "The Gothic Novel is a mix of old and new ideas. This is what Ian Watt calls an \"oxymoron,\" or a word that is a contradiction. The Gothic style has been both praised and criticized. Some people say it has no real depth, but others think it is a powerful way to express the \"terrible sublime.\"\n\nThe first Gothic Novel was written by Horace Walpole. It is called The Castle of Otranto. This book combined old and new ideas from romance stories. Walpole used old theatrical elements and new ways of writing to create a new kind of story. He called it \"A Gothic Story.\"\n\nThe Gothic style uses ideas from medieval times, like Gothic architecture and theater. Even when The Castle of Otranto was first published, the word \"Gothic\" was not used just to describe this style. It was used to describe many people, styles, and time periods. People thought it was old-fashioned and not modern.\n\nThe combination of old and new ideas in Gothic Novels is what makes them special. This is why they remain popular for a long time.\n\nOne important idea in Gothic Novels is the concept of chivalry. This idea is from medieval times. It is about the code of behavior for knights. In the first Gothic Novel, The Castle of Otranto, chivalry is used in a special way. The writer, Horace Walpole, wanted to show that society had lost its chivalrous values. He was writing during a time of great trouble in politics. He thought that the old values of chivalry were better than the morals of his time.\n\nThe character of Frederic in The Castle of Otranto is an example of this idea. He is a prince who has suffered a great loss. He is described as brave, courteous, and noble. These are all qualities of a chivalrous knight. Walpole uses these qualities to show what is missing in his society.\n\nThe Gothic style has been around for a long time. It is a mix of old and new ideas that continues to be popular today.",
            "Supply chain management is the process of moving goods from the customer to the final product. It includes the stages of raw materials, supply, production, and distribution. The term supply chain management was created in 1982 by a man named Keith Oliver. He described the process of planning, controlling, and organizing the supply chain to meet customer needs quickly and efficiently.\n\nThere are six main parts of a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers use these parts to give good service to customers.\n\nProduction is the first step in the supply chain. It is the base of the whole process. Managers decide what products to make and how many to make. They look at the market to see what customers want. The market helps them decide what products to make and how many.\n\nOnce managers decide what to make, they choose where to make it. They think about the quality and amount of products. They also think about customer needs. Then, they plan the work and take care of the equipment.\n\nProduction is an important step. Every detail is important. If one detail is not planned right, it can cost the company time and money. For example, companies like Wal-Mart and Target have a plan for every part of their business. They show how things should be done, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments. This helps the company work smoothly.\n\nThe second important part of the supply chain is supply. Supply means the company decides how to make things and who to work with. Companies may have many groups that make the same product. They decide which group is best for each part of the process. They may also work with other companies to make things. This helps the company be fast and flexible, and also saves money.",
            "A sign in Burma says Hitler is alive. Ellen Page, an actress, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of paper above her head. The sign has a bad message. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a country in Southeast Asia. A bad government controls Burma. In 1962, the government took power by force. In 2007, people in the street began to protest. Many monks led the protests. The protests were named the Saffron Revolution because of the color of the monks' robes. The government at first allowed the monks to gather, but soon the situation became very bad. The military attacked the monks and many monasteries. Journalists were arrested and some were killed. The government said only 13 people died, but a former soldier said many more died.\n\nThis is not new. Many governments have tried to stop people from disagreeing with them throughout history. In ancient times, Roman leaders said they were chosen by gods to rule. Some people believe that Japanese leaders are gods. The current U.S. president, George Bush, has meetings with a man who leads a group that does not like certain people.\n\nOne bad example is the Tiananmen Square protest in China in 1989. Many students, workers, and intellectuals protested against the government. The government said 200-300 people died, but others said between 2,000-3,000 people died. Another bad thing happened in Rwanda in the 1990s. Hutu groups and the government killed many people who were not like them. The Nazis, led by Hitler, also killed many people who were Jewish.",
            "Duke Ellington made a big impact on jazz music. He was a great composer and pianist who worked with his band for a long time. He was able to make each musician in the band sound good on their own and together they made music that was new and interesting.\n\nEllington was good at writing music that let musicians improvise and play freely. He also wrote music with strong structures that sounded good together. He knew how each musician played and how they fit together in the band. This helped him create some of the best music in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary talks about Ellington's special sound and how he was a pioneer in jazz. He used the human voice as a musical instrument in many of his songs. This was a new idea at the time. One of his early songs, Creole Love Call, is a good example of this. It is a slow and simple song with six parts:\n\nPart 1: The voice and the woodwind instruments talk to each other. The voice starts with a smooth sound and ends with a rough sound.\nPart 2: A trumpet player plays a solo with a lot of feeling and expression.\nPart 3: A clarinet player plays a fast and exciting solo with a piano playing a subtle rhythm in the background.\nPart 4: The whole band plays together and imitates the first part of the song.\nPart 5: The woodwind instruments take the lead and the brass section plays a strong rhythm.\nPart 6: The song goes back to the first part, with the voice playing like an instrument.\n\nEllington also used a special technique called the \"growl\" in this song. He was good at making his musicians sound good and he liked to experiment with new sounds and ideas.\n\nIn another song, Hot and Bothered, Ellington combined his skill at writing music with his ability to create new sounds. He used a trumpet player, Bubber Miley, and a singer, Baby Cox, to make a rich and interesting sound. In another song, It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), Ellington used a trombone player, Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, to introduce the melody in a special way.\n\nEllington was a master of using the human voice and other instruments to create new and exciting music. He was a true innovator in the world of jazz.",
            "She had a feeling that something was missing. This feeling was not going away. It started when she was 14 years old. Three years later, at 17, she still had this feeling. She decided she wanted to find someone to care about. But she did not feel interested in any boys. Some boys tried to talk to her, but she did not like them. She wondered why this was happening to her. She thought about this problem for a long time. She had some ideas, but they did not make sense.\n\nHer home was usually a peaceful place. Her parents were calm and nice. They did not fight with each other. They rarely argued with her. They argued about her wanting to be free and independent. She was the daughter of calm parents, but she was very outgoing and fun. She was a nice person.\n\nToday was not a calm day. She was looking for something to do when she heard a loud cry from the kitchen. Her mother was lying on the floor. She was hurting and saying \"ow\" many times. Her daughter rushed to her side. \"Mom, what's wrong?\" she asked. She saw her mother hurt. \"Ow, sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital,\" her mother said. Her daughter helped her up and drove her to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital smelled bad and was not a nice place. But her daughter was too worried to think about that.

            "This study shows that following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" helps reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke. The diet is known as the aMed diet. It is a special kind of Mediterranean diet. People who follow this diet eat a lot of plant foods, like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes. They also eat more monounsaturated fat and fish. They eat less animal products and saturated fat. A little bit of alcohol is allowed.\n\nPast studies have shown that following the Mediterranean diet can help people live longer and be healthier. They also found that this diet is better than a low-fat diet for losing weight and lowering cholesterol levels.\n\nThis study looked at 74,886 women who were 38 to 63 years old. They were all nurses and had never had heart disease or diabetes. The study lasted 20 years. The women answered food questionnaires six times to show what they ate. The researchers used these answers to create a score that showed how well they followed the aMed diet.\n\nThe researchers found that women who followed the aMed diet closely had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. They looked at how many women got heart disease or stroke over 20 years. They found that women who followed the diet closely had a 29% lower risk of heart disease and a 29% lower risk of stroke.\n\nThe researchers controlled for other factors that could affect the results, like age, smoking, weight, and exercise. They also looked at how much the women drank and how much aspirin they took. The results showed that following the aMed diet is good for women's heart health.",
            "In 2007, the United States had a big financial problem. Many people were without jobs, and the housing market crashed. Some of America's most important companies went out of business. This big problem continues today. We must ask: how did this happen, and how can we stop it? The answer is simple. The financial crisis was caused by bad and foolish decisions made by politicians. They forced banks and companies to give loans to people who could not pay them back. The banks did not have enough money to cover these loans. They sold these bad loans to other companies and to the public. When people could not pay their loans, the banks lost money and the economy got sick.\n\nThis financial problem started in 1999. President Clinton wanted to be elected for a second time. He wanted to be popular. To do this, he made it easier for people to get loans. He wanted more people to buy homes. This made it possible for banks to give loans to people who could not afford them. This was a big mistake.\n\nSteven Holmes, a reporter from the New York Times, wrote about this problem in 1999. He said that Fannie Mae, a company that helps people buy homes, was under pressure to give more loans to people who needed them. He also said that Fannie Mae might have problems if the economy got worse. And that's exactly what happened.\n\nMany factors combined to make the economy worse. Some people got loans that they could not afford to pay back. These loans were called adjustable-rate mortgages. They were like loans that got more expensive over time. People also got loans that were based on bad debts. This made the economy very weak. When the housing market crashed, the banks lost a lot of money. The top five investment banks in the United States had $4.1 trillion dollars of bad loans. This was 30% of the country's wealth. In the end, some of these banks went out of business. The government had to take control of Fannie and Freddie, two big companies that were in trouble.",
            "Exposition: the part of your story where you tell too much.  Dr. Merlin says this can be bad.  It can make readers fall asleep or press the \"Back\" button.\n\nThe rule \"Show, don't tell\" is well-known.  But Dr. Merlin still tells too much sometimes.  Exposition is like having a devil on your shoulder saying \"Tell them now!\" \n\nExposition means telling what happened.  In movies, this happens when one character tells another a lot of information.  In stories, the writer does the telling.\n\nHere is an example.  In a story, you might be told that a woman met her husband at a certain time and place.  They were married in a big ceremony.  Her husband was killed in front of her.  You would not want this to take a lot of pages.  You would want to know more about the husband and his wife.  You would want to see how they talked and acted to know how much they loved each other.  This would make you feel sad when he dies and care more about the woman.\n\nAs a writer, you need to add details.  It is tempting to rush through some parts.  For example, you might want to tell that a new character was in the Air Force and is now the night manager of a gas station.  He was married twice, has no children, and likes to fish.  But this might not be interesting to readers.  They might want to see how he acts and talks, not just what he does.",
            "I watched two news programs from NBC 4 in Columbus, Ohio. The first one was a live broadcast on August 13, 2011. The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who hurt his wife with a knife. The police had arrested him. They showed his picture. I think they spent the right amount of time on this story.\n\nThe second story was about a shooting in the Sharon Woods area. A young man named Travis Buyers was shot and is in serious condition. The police have not caught anyone yet. This story was short. I think it might be because the victim was a black man. I have noticed that when a white person is hurt or missing, the news covers it more. But when a minority person is hurt or missing, it gets less attention.\n\nThe next story was about a gunshot hole in a helicopter. The police think it happened in a certain area. A small bullet from a rifle hit the helicopter. The police are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for information that helps them catch the person who shot the helicopter.\n\nThe next story was about rain and thunderstorms on Saturday afternoon. The weather will be warm, around the mid-eighties. The news wanted to keep you watching.\n\nThey also covered a robbery at a store on Clime Road in Columbus. A black man with a hoodie robbed the store. He is about six feet tall and weighs about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they spent too much time saying he was black.\n\nThe next story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez. He was a big drug dealer. He was caught and will be in prison for twenty-five years. I am not sure why they said \"300 months\" instead of twenty-five years. They also mentioned he is a Hispanic man, but that is not important to the story.",
            "There is a special bond between brothers. This bond is strong and never breaks. Inside this bond are many feelings: love, pride, jealousy, and anger. Brothers know each other very well. They see themselves when they look at their brother. When a situation is very bad, the true nature of this bond appears. This bond can be good or bad. The emotions that come with it can be very costly. Understanding these emotions means dealing with their effects. When you look a brother in the eye and see yourself in them, you see how you really are. Your actions and their results show your true character.\n\nThe story \"The Scarlet Ibis\" shows this idea. Two brothers explore this theme and the strong emotions that come with it. They go on a journey through a beautiful and vivid place. Bitter disappointment and great pride meet in a big moment, and only one brother lives. The story shows this theme through the main character, Doodle, and how he behaves with his brother. It also shows this theme through the narrator, who helps us understand the main character's feelings and how he sees the world.\n\nThe main character's actions are all about one feeling: pride. From the start, he wanted a brother to teach him things like running and climbing trees. He wanted a brother to play with and be friends with. But his little brother, Doodle, was sick and could not do these things. This made the main character very sad and angry. He even thought about hurting Doodle. But when Doodle smiled at him, he felt happy and loved him. This shows that his anger was not as strong as he thought. He had a natural love for his brother.",
            "The brain is a very complicated system that processes information. A long time ago, people thought the brain was like a piece of wax. Later, they thought it was like a piece of paper called papyrus. Then, they thought it was like a book. Now, many people think it is like a computer. But the usefulness of these ideas is limited. They can lead to wrong conclusions.\n\nThe brain gets information from our senses. Our senses take in things like touch, heat, and light. They change this information into signals that the brain can understand. The brain works with this information in two ways. It looks at the information from the bottom up, and it looks at it from the top down. For example, when you look at a picture of a black box on a white background, the brain first looks at the color, shape, and edges of the box. Then, it uses this information to decide what you are seeing. The top-down process helps you understand what the box is.\n\nThe brain also decides which information is important. It uses a filter to decide what to pay attention to. For example, when you look at the grass near your shoes, your brain sees all the blades of grass. But you do not notice them unless you want to. Your brain is very good at focusing on what is important.\n\nThe brain stores information in different ways. There is sensory memory, which stores information for a short time. There is also working memory, which stores information for about 20 seconds. And there is long-term memory, which stores information for a long time. To store information, the brain must first change it into a form it can use. This is called encoding. For example, when you hear a word, the brain can encode it in different ways. It can encode the word based on how it looks, how it sounds, or what it means.\n\nThe brain is not fully understood. There are many models of how it works. Some models are based on how people remember things. Some are based on computers. And some are based on the brain's physical structure. One model says that the brain is like a network of connected ideas. For example, the idea of a chair might be connected to the idea of a table, which is connected to the idea of wood.",
            "Aldous Huxley writes about a bad future in his book Brave New World. He wants to show the dangers of modern technology and the way society is controlled by the government. In this future, people value being together in a group more than being individual. They are taught from a young age to be happy right now, not to think about the future or past. The people are like pawns in a game. They follow one way of thinking, which is controlled by the World Controller.\n\nHuxley's book is like a warning about the bad things that can happen when we follow a system like capitalism. He uses words from a philosophy called Marxism to show how this system can make people do things they don't want to do. For example, people in the lower classes do not know how the system works. They are brainwashed to want to buy things and be happy, but they do not think about the world around them. The people in charge control the lower classes and make them do what they want.\n\nIn Brave New World, the people do not have real relationships with each other. They do not have deep feelings or strong emotions. They only talk about surface things, like how someone looks. This shows that Huxley thinks that modern technology and capitalism can take away our freedom and make us lose our individuality.\n\nThe way people in the book accept their place in society is also like what Marx said would happen with capitalism. The lower classes are happy to be lower, and the upper classes do not care about changing the system. This is like a big problem in society. People are not free to think for themselves or feel deep emotions.\n\nHuxley's book is like a warning to us about the dangers of a system that controls people too much. He wants us to think about how we live and what we value.",

It was far from the center of campus. I had to walk a lot. It took 25 minutes to walk to class in Willard building. But it was often cold and rainy. The weather made it even harder to walk.\n\nI talked to an old friend. He said he used to like biking to campus. He stopped for a few years, but he thinks biking is the best way to get around. Biking is good for your body and it is fast. I live off campus now. My home is as far from campus as some dorms. I bought a bike and it has been a good decision. I go to Thomas building every day. It takes 5 minutes to ride my bike. But the road I take is not always safe.\n\nWalking is another option, but I am too busy. If I didn’t have a bike, I would have to walk every day. It would take 30-40 minutes. That is over two hours a week. I do not have that much time."
