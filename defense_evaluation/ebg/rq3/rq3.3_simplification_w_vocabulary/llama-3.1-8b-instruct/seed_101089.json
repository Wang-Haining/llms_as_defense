            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "This report explains the Biological and Sociocultural models for insomnia, a sleep disorder. The Biological model looks at genetics and medical health. The Sociocultural model examines the relationship between the environment and factors such as race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.\n\nThe report examines research on these models and explains each study. It then discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the research.\n\nInsomnia is a sleep disorder that can be caused by different things. It can be a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental problem, or a sleep disorder caused by a medical condition or a substance. \n\nThe primary sleep disorders include Dyssonmias and Parasomnias. Dyssonmias are problems with falling asleep or staying asleep. Parasomnias are sleep disorders that include behavioral and physical problems. Examples of Dyssonmias are Primary Insomnia and Primary Hypersomnia. Primary Insomnia is a problem with getting enough sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is a problem with staying awake.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders looks at genetics and how our bodies work. Research has shown that neurons in the brain called orexin help us sleep and wake up. A study on mice found that a receptor in the brain called GABAB helps us sleep. If this receptor is not working well, it can cause problems sleeping. The study found that a medicine called baclofen can help people sleep by activating the GABAB receptor.\n\nThe Sociocultural model of sleep disorders looks at how our environment affects our sleep. If the GABAB receptor is inherited, it can affect our sleep. This means that people may be more likely to have insomnia if their parents had it. This can have a big impact on our lives, especially when we have to do repetitive tasks and need to focus.",
            "This paper talks about Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, we will explain what CAPD is. Then, we will talk about how to diagnose the disorder. Finally, we will discuss how a teacher can help a student with CAPD in a regular classroom.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) is a problem with how the brain uses sound. It is not a hearing problem. People with CAPD can hear sounds, but their brain has trouble understanding them. The brain has trouble separating sounds from background noise and understanding what people are saying.\n\nThe idea of CAPD was first talked about in the 1950s. Researchers were studying children with communication problems. They started giving tests to these children in 1954. In 1961, a researcher named Kimura created a test to understand how the brain works when we hear two sounds at the same time.\n\nCAPD can cause several problems. A person with CAPD may have trouble finding the source of a sound. They may also have trouble hearing two or more sounds at the same time. It is hard for them to understand patterns in sounds. They may not be able to hear the difference in speech, like understanding sarcasm. Sometimes, one sound can cover up another sound. A person with CAPD may not be able to use sound clues to make sense of things. They may also have trouble understanding the order of sounds.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a doctor or specialist will watch how a person listens and reacts to sounds. They may also give tests to see how well the person can understand sounds. These tests may include questionnaires, watching how the person behaves, and measuring how well they can hear sounds in different situations. There is no one test that works for everyone, and we do not know what causes CAPD.\n\nA teacher in a regular classroom can help a student with CAPD in several ways. First, they can give the student extra help understanding instructions. They can also give the student time to ask questions. Teachers can also try to reduce background noise in the classroom. This can help the student with CAPD focus on what the teacher is saying. Finally, teachers can work with the student to develop strategies to help them understand and use sound clues.",

            "The German colonial rule was very bad. It was especially bad for the Ovaherero and Nama people in German South West Africa. The German colonial rule was not the same in all the colonies.

When the British took over German East Africa in 1919, they found many Africans who could read and write. The German government in other colonies also worked to educate Africans.\n\nBut the situation in South West Africa was very different. The German government did not do much to educate the local people. Instead, missionary groups helped the local people. The government did help Europeans in the colony get an education. The government built schools for them and helped the missionary schools. The German government's decision had a big effect on South West Africa. Many years later, the country still had a lot of problems because of this.\n\nOther German colonies had many educated and literate Africans. But in South West Africa, most people were not educated. They did not know how to read or write. Many things caused these problems in South West Africa. This paper wants to look at these things and learn more about the attitudes of the people in charge and the settlers.\n\nThere is a lot of writing about education in the German colonies. Most of these writings were in German and were written a long time ago. They described the education systems in the colonies. Later writings compared the education systems in different colonies. They looked at how the education systems were similar and different. One important study was done by Cohen. He compared education in South West Africa and East Africa. He said that the reason for the differences was because of the number of European settlers in South West Africa.\n\nSouth West Africa had a good climate, but it had a lot of desert. The number of Europeans living there was not very big. In 1913, only about 15,000 Europeans lived in South West Africa. Many more Europeans lived in other German colonies. For example, only 5,336 Europeans lived in East Africa.",
            "The kinds of music we call \"pop music\" have changed a lot over the last 100 years. Now we have many kinds of pop music. It is hard to make a complete list of all the kinds. Even the main kinds of pop music - like rock, country, jazz, and folk - have many smaller kinds within them.\n\nOne of the most interesting kinds of music is called Heavy Metal rock. It has a lot of emotions in it, mostly sad and dark feelings. But even though it is dark, people have made many different kinds of Heavy Metal music. They did this because it is very flexible and can be used in many ways.\n\nNow, there are many different kinds of Heavy Metal music. They have taken ideas from other kinds of music and made them their own. But Heavy Metal music started from somewhere. To understand the music we hear today, we need to know what Heavy Metal music is and why it is called a \"movement\" rather than just a kind of music.\n\nHeavy Metal music is often about darkness. It is music that is loud and strong. People who play Heavy Metal music are very good at playing their instruments. The music is different from other kinds of music because it is not simple. It has a lot of complicated parts.\n\nHeavy Metal music also came from people who used drugs to help them create their music. In the 1970s, many people used drugs, and this led to some strange and new kinds of music. The music was like a reflection of the users' feelings, which were often sad and dark. Later, other people made music that was influenced by the dark feelings of the past. They took some of the ideas from the past and used them to make new music.\n\nSome songs, like \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles, show the dark side of music. This song is considered one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to another song by the Rolling Stones, which was also very loud and dark. The Beatles wanted to show that they could make music as loud and dark as the Stones.",
            "Henri Rousseau was a French artist. He lived from 1844 to 1910. Before the Surrealist artists made famous dreamlike paintings, Rousseau worked on his own dream-inspired art. His famous painting, The Dream, shows a woman looking at the wonders of a new place in her dream. But it also shows Rousseau's own hopes and dreams as an artist.\n\nRousseau wanted people to like and accept his art. He wanted to be famous and well-known. But he faced a big problem. He could either paint like other famous artists and follow the rules, or he could be different and do his own thing. This was a problem he had all his life.\n\nTo understand The Dream, you need to know about Rousseau's life. He was born in a town in northwest France. His father was a hardware dealer. Rousseau did not go to art school. He grew up and worked for the government until he was 40. After that, he started painting to make himself happy. He wanted to escape his sad life after his first wife died. He had eight baby children who also died. He had one daughter left, Julia.\n\nRousseau's art was different from other artists. He painted simple things and was a bit like a folk artist. He wanted to be accepted by the art world. But he had to compete with other famous artists like Matisse. Matisse was a talented artist who did not want to paint in a boring way. Rousseau, on the other hand, wanted to paint in a way that would make him famous.\n\nRousseau finally got recognition when he was older. But it was not until Matisse was already famous. A writer named Jan Gordon said that Rousseau's goal was to paint in a way that was safe and accepted by everyone. He wanted to be part of the French art group.",
            "Many great thinkers believe that ethics and art are connected. They think that truth and beauty are closely related. I agree with this idea. A poet named John Keats said, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty.\" He said this in a poem about a special cup. He means that beauty and truth are the same thing. We learn many things in life from education and experience. But we like or dislike art and morals without being taught. Both ethics and aesthetics try to explain, not tell us what to do. We try to understand why a piece of art is beautiful or why an action is good, rather than following rules. \n\nWe can't fully explain why something is good or beautiful. Critics of art or morals can't say exactly what makes something good. They might talk about things like how an artist uses color or background. But these things don't explain why something is good. When people talk about their favorite art or literature, they often say, \"There's something about it.\" Then they give more details. I think that art and morals can't be explained completely. We can't say everything about why something is good or beautiful. A writer, Flannery O'Connor, said, \"You tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" We tell a story to say something that can't be said in another way. I think ethics is the same. A philosopher, Wittgenstein, said, \"Ethics can't be explained. Ethics is beyond words.\" I think that this \"something\" is what makes art and morality so powerful. It's this \"something\" that connects them.\n\nI believe that ethics and art are closely related because they affect us deeply. We can't fully understand them, but we can feel them. This is especially true for literature. Literature is special because it deals with values. We learn values from literature, and that's why it's so important.",
            "Germany is a strong country today. It is united with its own culture. This culture is from many different groups that lived in the area near the Alps in München to the city of Kiel on the Baltic Sea. You can feel the same culture in Köln on the Rhine River and in the city of Dresden on the Elbe River. This is not surprising because Germany's culture comes from many different sources, including old tribes.\n\nThe land of the Germans is called Germania. We do not know for sure how the name came to be. Some people think it came from a Germanic tribe. Others believe it came from the word for a spear, which the Germans used in war. It may also have come from an old Irish word that means \"to shout.\" The Germans were known to be loud.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote about the Germans in his book. He said that the Germans were an ancient group of people and not a mix of different groups. They were living in Germany when the Romans arrived. The Romans came to Germany to trade and to take things from the land. They also sent soldiers to fight in Germany, but they mostly went back to Rome.\n\nThe Germanic tribes began to appear in the first century. They lived near the Roman Empire and traded their goods. Some Germans also served in the Roman army.",
            "I looked down and saw a picture in front of me. My mind was empty and not thinking about anything. I was watching the picture without feeling any strong emotions. My mind was working well, like a machine. I was looking at the picture, but I was not thinking about it in a special way.\n\nI once got an art book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" An artist friend told me to get it. The book teaches people how to draw. It says to use a square to help you look at a picture. This helps you see the picture in a simple way. It makes the picture smaller and easier to understand.\n\nI was looking at a bowl of fruit on a table. But I could not think of the square to put around the picture. I was too surprised. I stood and looked at the picture in wonder.\n\nSome artists, like Picasso, like blue. Others, like Monet, like green. The old masters in Italy liked many colors. If I wanted to be a good artist, this was my chance. This was the start of my picture, my story, called \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy hand moved to get a pencil. My hand moved to the toilet to draw. But my hand hit the toilet handle again and again. The brown package was stuck. I was very frustrated.\n\nI held a mop, and I was thinking about the brown package. It was a waste of food. Someone had left it in the toilet at the Rite Aid store. I wanted it to go away. I wanted to clean it up.\n\nI looked at the wall and took some toilet paper. My hand went into the toilet to try and get the package. I was careful, like a mom taking out a turkey for Thanksgiving.",
            "Many young drivers die in car accidents.  Several things combine to cause this problem.  The National Institutes of Health say one reason is that young brains are not ready for the dangers of driving.  Young people also do not have much experience driving.  This lack of experience causes more car accidents and more severe injuries.  Teens do worse when they drive with their friends.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center studied this.  They found a connection between the age of the passenger and the number of car accidents.\n\nCalifornia and other states try to make driving safer for young people.  They do this by giving temporary licenses that limit the hours young people can drive and do not allow other young passengers.\n\nBut these temporary licenses are not enough.  The real problem is that young people are not good at handling the risks and responsibilities of driving.  A psychologist named Marvin Zuckerman says 18 years old is too young for a regular driver's license.  He says young people under 19 or 20 often want to take risks because it is exciting.  This means we should delay giving driver's licenses to young teens.  If we do not, there will be more car accidents and the number of deaths will be very high.  By 2010, many new teen drivers will be on the road.\n\nWe can make a law to fix this problem.  Schools can teach driver's education classes.  But no one under 18 can drive a car.  A temporary permit can still be given before a full driver's license.  Young people must also get a certain number of hours of practice with a licensed driver.  The number of hours can be the same as the number of hours most states require.  A national law would be a good way to keep young people safe across the country.\n\nThis idea is not new.  But it can help save lives.",
            "The Library of Congress has a collection of early Edison films. I looked through them. I found 15 trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films use creative editing to create illusions. I studied these films to learn about their style and growth. Most trick films from this time are set in a fixed frame. The camera does not move to follow people or objects. The style comes from theater and vaudeville shows.\n\nIn some films, actors move side to side. They do not walk towards or away from the camera. An example is the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right and move back and forth.\n\nThe camera does not follow the actors when they leave the frame. Trick films usually show the whole scene at one time. They do not use close-up shots like we see in modern movies. This style comes from theater and vaudeville. The performers stay in the middle of the stage and do not move towards the camera.\n\nMost early trick films show one scene at a time. This means they are usually short, only a minute or less. The films show simple tricks, like magic and disappearing acts. But sometimes, one scene is made up of many small parts. A good example is The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895). If you look closely, you can see where the camera starts to show Mary's head being cut off.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a strong supporter of Republican ideas.  He was a farmer, but he also worked in politics.  These two things made him known for his strong opinions about personal freedom and government.  He believed that farming was the best job.  This idea influenced his thoughts about government.  He wanted to protect and help this kind of job.\n\nTaylor thought the United States had a great chance to create a perfect system of government.  There was no old way of doing things to get in the way.  He believed in the basic rights of people.  These rights are like a team.  If one right is not fair, all the others are not good either.  He said the government should not control these rights.\n\nTaylor said that some people with power and evil ideas would take advantage of others in nature.  But in a society, this should not happen.  To make a good society, the government must understand both good and bad in people.  Taylor thought government is like people.  It can be good or bad, depending on how it is run.\n\nTaylor believed that a good government protects property, helps farming, and does not support capitalism.  He thought a good government would be fair, no matter who is in charge.  He believed that self-interest is a bad thing when it hurts others.  But it is not always bad.  A good government can keep this self-interest from making problems.\n\nTaylor wanted the government to be limited.  He did not want the government to have more power than the Constitution said it could have.  He thought a big government would be expensive and could be cruel.  But he also thought a simple, strict reading of the Constitution could be bad.  Without understanding the ideas of the people who wrote it, this way of looking at the Constitution could be unfair.  Taylor thought the Declaration of Independence was more important than the Constitution.  It said that the United States is a group of states, not one country.",
            "We look at Figure 17. There was a big drop in the number of people who used the commuter log in the third month of the project. This was not good news. It is hard to say why this happened. We know that winter came to the campus in New England. Fewer people ride bikes or walk during the winter. This might be one reason for the drop. Students and teachers were busy in December. They were finishing school and getting grades. They may have forgotten to fill out the log. December is also the start of the holiday time. Many students and teachers do not need to come to campus for a month. Classes start again in late January. This might also be a reason for the low number of logs. But we still do not know why there were few logs in February. People might get excited about a new project at the beginning. Then, their interest might decrease. We tried to make the project more interesting in March with the Carpool Challenge Week. We got more logs for that month. This shows that we need to find a way to keep people interested in the project. We also need to consider the fact that people like to drive cars. This is a part of our culture. We need to give people good reasons to use other ways of commuting. We gave prizes like gift cards to local stores. We gave out these prizes throughout the project. It would have been interesting to see if bigger prizes would have made more people participate. For example, if we had given away a bike or a new car, we might have gotten more people to use the commuter log. We did not change the prizes during the project. If we had said that we would give better prizes in the future, people might have been more interested.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a type of investment. It follows an index, a product, or a group of things like an index fund. But it is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange. You get the benefits of many investments and the ability to own a single stock. You can sell some, buy more, and buy as little as one share at a time. ETFs are also less expensive than mutual funds. But you must pay a fee for trading them. There are many different types of ETFs available.\n\nWe are looking at the ETF IHF and its top 10 holdings that make up 63.58% of its assets. We want to know if owning this one ETF is the same as owning a group of its top 10 stocks. We also want to know if there are better ways to invest in these same stocks.\n\nTo make it easier, we will only look at the top 10 holdings. Below, you can see the top 10 stocks and the percentage of the ETF's assets they make up.\n\nWe can use a chart to see how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF. We can use the percentages to calculate the returns and risk of a portfolio made up only of these 10 stocks. The chart shows the results.\n\nThe chart shows that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could get a 6.11% higher return than the ETF. It also shows that its risk is 0.12 lower. This means that owning just the top 10 holdings could be a good choice. But we need to be sure that the differences are real. To do this, we need to check the standard deviation of each stock. This will tell us if the differences are important or not.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe wrote a poem called \"Dream-Land\". This is one of his good poems. He used a word \"Thulé\" in his poem. Poe said he got this word from the writer Virgil. Virgil used it to describe an island north of Britain. But Poe learned from another writer, Gothe. \n\nGothe was a famous German writer. Poe liked his work. Gothe wrote a poem called \"Faust\". It was published in two parts. The second part came out after Gothe died in 1832. There is a short poem in \"Faust\" called \"The King of Thulé\". It is about a king who loses his wife. He drinks a lot and cries about his dead wife. He then decides to die. He gives away all his things, except a special cup. He goes to a cliff, throws the cup into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. Poe's poem \"Dream-Land\" is similar to \"The King of Thulé\". Maybe this is because Poe had lost someone and drank a lot like the king. \n\nPoe used the word Thule in two of his poems. He said \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\". He used it twice in \"Dream-Land\", at the beginning and the end. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be read together. In \"Dream-Land\", the speaker talks about a dark and lonely place called Thule. He sees dead friends and a world without color. This is like what happens in \"The King of Thulé\". The king is lonely because his wife died. He lost his will to rule or live. \n\nGothe was a well-known writer. Poe would have read his work. Poe liked Tennyson, and Tennyson liked Gothe. Poe would have been interested in Gothe's work because of this connection.",
            "A customer in California was hurt when she slipped and fell on applesauce in a store. The store manager, Martin, was informed about the spill twice, but he did not clean it. He was eating dinner at the time. Can this customer get extra money from the store for being hurt? The answer is yes. She can argue that the store manager should have known that not cleaning the spill would cause harm. Many people had slipped and fallen in the store before. \n\nTo get extra money, the customer must show that the store manager acted on purpose and knew that his action would hurt someone. A court will not quickly reject her claim. The customer can say that the store manager should have cleaned the spill, even if it took some time. He should have known that not cleaning it would be a problem.\n\nThe store manager said he was busy eating dinner. But, he had been told about the spill twice. He ignored the problem. The customer slipped and fell 30 minutes later. This is not a good excuse. Many people had slipped and fallen in the store before, and the manager should have taken action.\n\nCalifornia law says a customer can get extra money if the store manager acted with malice. Malice means the manager wanted to hurt someone or showed a bad disregard for the customer's safety. In this case, the customer can argue that the manager did not take the spill seriously and put many people in danger. \n\nThe law in California says a court must consider if the store manager's actions were wrong and intended to cause harm. The customer can argue that the manager was aware that not cleaning the spill would cause harm and did not care. This is enough to make a claim for extra money.\n\nIn this case, six people slipped and fell in the store in one year. The manager did not take action to fix the problem. This is a good reason to argue that the manager acted with malice. He showed a bad disregard for the customers' safety.\n\nIn summary, the customer has a good chance to get extra money from the store for being hurt. She can argue that the store manager acted with malice and ignored the spill. This was a bad decision that put many people in danger.",
            "Four years ago, I took a class about Islam at CBC. A big question in the class was if Islam is a hostile religion. I think this question is still important today. Looking back at what happened since 9/11, I see that the media's view of Islam changed a great deal. From being very critical, it became more accepting. It's hard to believe that in 2001, a president with a Muslim background like Barack Obama could have run for office.\n\nI'm interested in the story of the Prophet Muhammad. What I learned about him seems different from his personality. I thought he forced people to become Muslims. He would win battles and then make the defeated tribes join his religion. But his story says he was a humble and kind man. He didn't try to prove himself, but lived a simple life with miracles. This makes me think the writers wanted people to see him as a special person, but it takes away from the legend of Jesus.\n\nThere are many stories in the biography that seem like they are trying to show how people believed in Muhammad on their own. But the problem is that many of these stories come from people who heard from others. This makes the stories seem less real. I don't like this because it makes it seem like they are trying to hide the truth.\n\nI have a big problem with the way the biography presents Muhammad. It says he was a kind and wise man, but history shows that he was not. I wonder if Muslims know the real story of how he became powerful.",
            "The ideas of Jesus were not kept after he died. The Christian way of thinking changed quickly. If we look at the past, we see that Christianity moved away from its roots. Today, we see a growing understanding and a new way of thinking. Many traditional people will not change. They will not accept new ideas. But they are not the majority. More and more people will be interested in the real meaning of Christianity. In the future, many people will want to know what Jesus truly said. They will want to separate the ideas added to Christianity over time from the true meaning of the religion. It may take time, but this will happen. Christianity will go back to its original form. A movement will start to remove extra ideas. It will be like going back in time. Only the ideas of Jesus will be left. When this happens in the United States and Europe, many people will follow Jesus' ideas as if they lived in his time. The church will remain strong to guide people. But the church will be more simple. There will be less difference between different groups. People will be more alike in what they believe. This is not the first time this has happened. The Roman Empire persecuted Christians, but later became Christian. Our country has changed from slave to leader. The same thing will happen in the Christian church. People will go back to the source. They will not care about different groups and ideas. To make this happen, people will start to understand Jesus' words as examples, not as real things. If we look far back in time, we only see Judaism. This is the base of the Christian religion. The idea of one god, the power of the Bible, and the authority of Jewish leaders were all important parts of Judaism before the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish people were not all the same. They had different groups like Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and many common people.",
            "The Jungle shows that people are naturally selfish and only think about themselves. They want to make their lives better, but they do not care about others. The book shows this in many ways. One example is the owners and managers of big factories. They only want to make their companies bigger and better. They do not care about anything that gets in their way or gets hurt. They do not care about the air pollution or the dirty water from the factory animals. \n\nThe owners and managers also do not care about their workers. They pay them very little and make them work long hours. They can fire workers without warning and without giving them any help finding a new job. During that time, there were no laws to protect workers. This meant the owners and managers could do what they wanted. The workers lived and worked in bad conditions. They did not have any help or information about their rights. Some workers formed unions, but they often made money from the poor workers. The workers were treated very badly and had no way to escape the system.\n\nThe Jungle says that people in this situation are like slaves. They are poor and do not have many opportunities. They depend on the owners and managers for their lives. That means they have to do what they are told, even if it is bad for them. The book says that in this situation, bad behavior is common and expected.",
            "F. Scott Fitzgerald uses different methods to make readers feel a certain way about important things. He\nuses many of these methods in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs words together\nto make a new meaning. He uses this to give a special feeling around a subject. Fitzgerald also uses\nsymbols and gives them meaning. Then he uses the same symbol for the same feeling. He does this with\nmany colors, like gold, green, white, gray, red, and pink.\n\nFitzgerald uses white and gray to show sameness. White means nice and high class, but gray means old\nand faded. He starts to show this in the beginning of the novel. He uses these colors many times. Daisy\nand Jordan wear white all the time. Nick wears white clothes to Gatsby's party. Tom wears a white shirt\nwhen he meets Myrtle. Fitzgerald uses these colors on many ordinary things, like a white chasm in New\nYork, gray cars, and gray land.\n\nAfter he shows the meaning of white and gray, he uses them to show that something is not important.\nHe starts with Daisy. He does not use these colors for a long time, and then he describes Daisy as wearing\nwhite. This shows that Daisy is not a special character, but just someone Gatsby wants.\n\nFitzgerald uses this technique again to show that Daisy is not special. For example, he describes her fur\ncollar as gray and her dress as white. He wants readers to see Daisy as just another person, not as a\nspecial person.",
            "San Diego County is a good place for growing food. The climate is mild and sunny. People grow many foods there. These include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy green vegetables, squash, broccoli, herbs, fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. Many people in the area want to buy organic food from local farms. Some farmers have long waiting lists for their community-supported agriculture programs. People also buy organic eggs and milk from these farmers.\n\nSome of these farms allow visitors to see how they grow food. People can also walk, hike, or watch birds on the farms. This helps the farmers make extra money and teach others about their work.\n\nOrganic farming is good for the environment. It helps plants and animals in the area. This is because it does not use chemicals in the soil and water. But organic farming can be more expensive than farming with chemicals. It needs more work and management to stop pests and weeds and make the soil healthy without chemicals. Organic farms also have higher losses than big farms that use chemicals. \n\nThe land chosen for this project is near the town of Potrero in San Diego County. It is 160 acres of land with chaparral, grass, and oak trees. The area is near the Cleveland National Forest. Many animals live there. Some are endangered and need our help. The area was once home to Native Americans and later to cattle ranchers and people who sold wood.\n\nI chose this land from a website and looked at government programs that can help small farmers. I found a real farm in the area that grows organic food. This farm is a model for what a farmer in the area might do to make a living and help the environment.",
            "Culture is very important in negotiations. It is not easy to define culture. It is not the same everywhere. Culture is not just one thing. We should not say that all people from a certain country are the same. For example, we should not say, \"All Russians are stubborn\" or \"All Japanese are very polite.\" It is better to understand the culture of a country and how it affects a negotiation.\n\nWhen we go to a new country, we see their culture in a way that makes sense to us. We make comparisons with our own culture. To understand a foreign culture, we can learn about its history or its problems. We should not judge or try to change their culture. We should accept it and work with it. This is especially true when we are in a weaker position in a negotiation.\n\nCulture is not just about countries. Companies also have their own cultures. A company's culture can be very different from another company's culture. Some companies work very hard, while others have a more relaxed schedule. We can see a company's culture in the way its employees dress, communicate, and work. Some companies want their employees to help others, but others do not.\n\nValues are very important to understand. They explain why people behave in certain ways. If people in a culture value saving face or being kind to each other, they will not do things that might hurt others. If people value hard work, they will try to get a good deal in a negotiation. We should think about these values before we start a negotiation. But we should also try to understand our opponent on a personal level to be successful in a negotiation.",
            "The Bible says, \"The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This idea is from Psalm 14. A Christian philosopher named St. Anselm used this idea in his argument about God's existence. We will also discuss Thomas Aquinas, who also believed in God. Both of their ideas are about the same God in the Bible. To compare their ideas, let's assume that they are both right.\n\nSt. Anselm's idea is that God exists in our minds. He says we can know God exists because we can think about God. This idea is based on faith. Faith is believing in something without proof.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas has a different idea. He says we can know God exists by using our reason and looking at the world around us. We do not need faith. He gives five reasons for God's existence. These reasons are change, cause, chance, perfection, and order. He says these reasons show that we need God. For example, imagine you have a puzzle with most of the pieces. If you know the whole picture, you can know what the missing piece is like.\n\nIn this way, St. Aquinas says we can know God exists using our minds and what we see in the world.",
            "Buddha was born in the fifth or sixth century BCE. He was a prince. Later in life, he gave up his position in the world and became a wise man. This man's teachings led to the creation of Buddhism. One part of Buddhism is called Theravada Buddhism. This religion is about 2,500 years old. It is different from what it was when Buddha was alive. You can see these changes in Theravada countries like Sri Lanka.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, a yearly ceremony is held. It is called the water-cutting ceremony. Monks and ordinary people take part in this ceremony. But Buddha never taught about a ceremony like this. These changes are not only in small things. They are in the main ideas of the religion too.\n\nThe Theravada Buddhist community has changed its ideas over time. This happened both from inside and outside the community. Inside the community, changes came from people who are Buddhist. Outside the community, changes came from people who are not Buddhist. Changes that are good for the community are called benign. Changes that are bad for the community are called hostile.\n\nTo understand this better, we need to know some key ideas. \n\nInternal means something that comes from inside the Buddhist community. External means something that comes from outside the community. Hostile means something that hurts the community. Benign means something that does not hurt the community, even if it has a bad effect.\n\nNow, let's look at the main ideas of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists believe in three important things: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is a collection of Buddhist teachings. It includes three groups of books: the Sutta Pitaka, the Vinaya Pitaka, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka.\n\nThe Sutta Pitaka has teachings that are like conversations. The Vinaya Pitaka has rules for Buddhist monks and nuns. The Abhidhamma Pitaka has ideas about the universe. Some of these ideas are that everything is not permanent, that life is hard, and that people have no soul.\n\nTo end the cycle of death and rebirth, people must understand these ideas. They must also understand that desire, hatred, and confusion are the causes of suffering. To stop suffering, people must give up these things. The Vinaya Pitaka has rules for lay Buddhists. These rules say do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not be lazy, and do not take drugs. Monks have more rules to follow.\n\nThe most important idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. The first truth is that life is suffering. The second truth is that attachment causes suffering. The third truth is that suffering can be ended.",
            "The United States and Mexico are two countries with a long history of rivalry. This rivalry lasted 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. The two countries had many fights. The biggest fight was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848. The United States won this war and got Texas and the American Southwest. \n\nThe rivalry began because of disagreements about religion, culture, and tradition. The two countries had different ideas about these things. They also had big problems with material goods. The United States and Mexico are not the only countries that have a big rivalry with a neighbor. Many countries that share a border have problems like this.\n\nDavid M. Pletcher says, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba do we find long-lasting American diplomatic problems.\" Both Mexico and Cuba are close to the United States. They have been rivals to the United States for a long time. Other countries in Latin America have good relations with the United States.\n\nReligion was a big problem between the two countries. The United States and Mexico had different ideas about what is right. This has been a problem for many countries throughout history. Sally Frahm says, \"If Americans were against fascism and communism in the twentieth century, they were against Catholicism and monarchy in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.\" The United States and Mexico had a rivalry based on their different ideas about religion. This was because of the distrust between the English and Spanish.\n\nThe United States and Mexico had many problems. They had 17 fights between 1836 and 1893. Most of these fights were about territory and border problems. Outlaws and bandits from the United States had problems on the border. This was a big problem until both countries used their military to control the border.\n\nThe rivalry between the United States and Mexico ended as Mexico became dependent on the United States. The United States changed its goals from expanding its territory to helping Mexico economically. This change happened in the later part of the 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I got sick. I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen nursing because I wanted a safe and secure job. Many people told me that nursing was a good job because people will always get sick. \n\nBut I had bigger dreams. I wanted to be a scientist or a journalist. However, I chose nursing. I am now 61 years old and unable to work. I get money from Social Security, but I have no savings. Every day is a struggle.\n\nI have been lucky because my family and some friends have helped me. But when something bad happens, you feel very weak. \n\nMy point is that life is full of emergencies. We cannot be sure of the future. We need to be prepared, but some problems are too big for one person to solve alone.\n\nI agree that we should not rely too much on big government. But I think we should try to trust each other more. We should help each other and ask for help when we need it. \n\nSome people say that America was built on rugged individualism. But it was really about helping each other and sharing what we have. The people who traveled across the country in wagons did not do it alone. They worked together.\n\nSo, be prepared. I have a disaster kit and first aid supplies. I also have food and water for a long time. If you have a big piece of land, you can grow your own food and store it for later. This is a good idea. But it is also important to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do living things change over time? Are there rules that guide the way they change? Many scientists have tried to understand this, but it is still a hard problem. Recently, some scientists have used math to study how animals grow and change. They looked at the shells of a certain type of animal called Prunum. The scientists want to know how these animals change over time and how their shells develop. They used special pictures of the shells to create math models. These models can help them understand how the animals' shells grow and change. The scientists also did experiments to learn more about the animals and their shells.\n\nA shell is like a tube that moves through space over time. It turns around in a circle, like a spiral. This spiral is divided into parts called whorls. Each whorl is like a ring that grows as the animal gets older. The whorls turn around a middle line that runs through the shell. This line is called the columella. The speed at which the whorls grow can be different, and a line separates each whorl. This line is called a suture. The last whorl of the shell is the biggest one. The spire is all the whorls except the last one. The tip of the spire is called the apex, and the other end is called the base. The animal comes out of its shell through a hole called the aperture.\n\nWe can look at shells in different ways. We can look at the top, the bottom, the front, or the back. Most of the time, we look at the front of the shell. When we look at the shell from the front, the aperture is open, and the apex is pointing up.\n\nTo measure the whorls, we look at the shell from the top and find where the first line is. Then we draw a line to divide the shell. We count the whorls from this line, and we can estimate the number of whorls to one-quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell is like a path that the animal follows as it grows. We can trace this path by looking at the center of each whorl and the size of the aperture. We can draw this path and use math to understand how the animal's shell grows. Once we have a math formula, we can change the parameters and see how the shell would grow differently.",
            "Indonesia's rate of death for newborn babies and infants has not improved much in the last ten years.  The country is doing well in some areas, like making clean water and sanitation available.  But the country is not making good progress in improving health for mothers and children.  Indonesia is not meeting its goals for improving health by 2015.  There are many reasons for this.  They will be explained below.\n\nIndonesia has made some progress in the number of births where a health worker is present.  Now, 72% of births have a worker like a nurse or a midwife.  But this does not mean all of these workers can give medical help if a mother or baby gets sick.  Many mothers and babies still die from bleeding during delivery.  This means the progress made in this area is not really very good.  Indonesia's health department also has a problem with treating children under five who have diarrhea.  Many children in the country do not get help from a health worker.  The country also does not have good records about taking care of mothers after they give birth.\n\nMany mothers do not have a cesarean operation when they need it.  In fact, only 4% of mothers have this operation.  The number of cesarean operations is higher in cities than in villages.  This shows that many people in villages do not have access to healthcare.  Many people can not afford healthcare because they have to pay out of their own money.  This is a big problem in Indonesia.\n\nTo improve health for mothers and babies, the government needs to decide what to do.  One idea is to help with specific programs for mothers and babies.  But this might not be the best idea.  Programs that focus on one area of health can be more effective and give faster results.  But they can also have some problems.  One problem is that they might take money and workers away from other areas of healthcare.  Another problem is that many programs can cause confusion and extra work.",
            "Victorian novels often look at small details. But two books, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, are different. They have mystery and strange things that are not common in other Victorian novels. This makes the characters more interesting and helps us understand their thoughts and feelings.\n\nOne time, Oliver Twist had many confusing ideas in his mind. He was walking with two men, Sikes and Crackit, who were arguing. Oliver thought he was still with them, but then he heard gunshots and people shouting. He felt pain and was taken away. This happened many times, and Oliver felt scared and in pain.\n\nOliver's dreams or strange times like these often tell us something about his feelings and problems. In one chapter, Oliver remembers being shot. He relives the moment like it's a dream. This shows how Oliver had no control over what happened to him. He was in a lot of pain and was taken away without knowing what was happening.\n\nOliver's life is hard. He has little control over things. He can't even try to take care of himself when his life is in danger. This makes us think that Oliver gives up easily. Maybe someone else is controlling him, making him feel this way.\n\nAnother time, Oliver says, \"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\" This means that time goes by quickly when you are in a bad situation. Oliver feels like he is trapped in a long night that is not ending.",
            "I worked in an after-school program two years ago. I helped students who needed help in different subjects. But my strengths were in English and reading. One boy, Adrian, had trouble reading. He was in third or fourth grade. I think he was having a big problem. Some letters he could read well, but not others. This was strange.\n\nAdrian spoke perfect English, but I learned that his mother did not speak English. She spoke only Spanish. I know a little Spanish, but not much. We talked a little. Then I understood the problem. Adrian could read, but he did not know the English alphabet well.\n\nI share this story to talk about the problem of language barriers in schools. Even students who speak good English can still have trouble reading. I think everyone agrees this is a problem. What can we do? For Adrian, the answer was simple. He needed help with reading and the alphabet.\n\nBut for students who do not speak much English, the answer is not simple. There is no one solution. We need to try many things. These are bilingual education, English as a Second Language (ESL) classes, and private tutors. We need to use all of these things together.\n\nOne good idea is bilingual education. This is when students learn in two languages. This helps students do well in school. Some people are afraid of this idea. They think it is a waste of money and that most students will not benefit. But this is not true. If we used this idea in all schools, all students would benefit.\n\nHow can we make this happen? Do we need all teachers to speak two languages? No, this would be hard. But we can have special helpers who speak two languages. These helpers can work with students who need extra help.",
            "Most of us learn as children that there is something bigger than us.  We may go to Sunday school or the Temple to learn about it.  Some people search for answers inside themselves.  Many people accept the religion their parents teach.  But some people reject it.  They do not believe there is something beyond what they know.  We may change our minds and choose a different way.  Every person chooses a path to understand spirituality in their own way.  We look for a light in the dark to guide us.\n\nI asked my father about his favorite bird one day.  We were on our front porch, listening to the rain.  He stared out into the rain.  He looked thin and tired.  His hair was thinning.  I felt sad and afraid.  I didn't want to talk about how much I would miss him.  I hugged him and sat close to him.  We looked out into the rain together.\n\nMy father died in December.  He had cancer.  The doctors tried to make him feel better, but it was not easy.  He suffered for a few more months than the doctors said he would.  I could not understand why he had to suffer so much.  If God existed, I thought, he was not listening to me.\n\nI did not want to watch my father die.  I wanted to remember how he lived, not how he died.  I wanted my father to be happy, not sad and weak.  I curled up in bed for three days and waited for the news.  No one called me to tell me about my father's death.",
            "The Gothic Novel is called an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New'\" by Ian Watt. This means it is a mix of old and new things. The Gothic style has been both praised and criticized. Some people think it has no real meaning, while others say it is powerful and exciting. The first Gothic Novel was written by Horace Walpole. He combined old ideas from medieval times with new ideas from modern novels. This created a new way of writing.\n\nHorace Walpole's book, The Castle of Otranto, used old theatrical ideas and new ways to write about nature. He called it \"A Gothic Story.\" The Gothic style uses old ideas from medieval times, like theater and architecture. Many people thought the word \"gothic\" was old-fashioned and not sophisticated. But the combination of old and new made the Gothic style stay popular for a long time.\n\nOne important idea in Gothic novels is chivalry. Chivalry is a set of rules for knights to follow. It includes being brave, honorable, and strong. Gothic writers liked this idea because it showed a perfect person. They wanted to show how society was not perfect and that we need to be better. The writer of The Castle of Otranto, Horace Walpole, was worried about the future. He thought the world was not a good place. He used the idea of chivalry to show how we should be better. The main character, Frederic, is a prince who has suffered a lot. He is brave, kind, and strong like a knight. This is an example of how the Gothic style uses old ideas to make a new kind of story.",
            "Supply chain management is the process of moving goods from the customer to the final product. It includes many steps: getting raw materials, making the product, storing it, and sending it to the customer. The idea of supply chain management was created in 1982 by a man named Keith Oliver. He said that the goal is to satisfy customers quickly and efficiently.\n\nThere are six key parts of a supply chain. They are production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these parts to serve customers well.\n\nProduction is the first step. It is the beginning of the supply chain process. Managers must know what customers want. They look at the market to find out. The market tells them what customers need. Once managers understand what customers want, they decide what products to make and how many. They must choose where to make the products and which factory will work best. They think about the customer's needs and wants.\n\nAfter deciding where to make the products, managers focus on planning work and taking care of machines. Production is a very important part of the supply chain. Every detail is important. If details are not planned well, the company may lose time and money. For example, a company like Wal-Mart has a plan for everything. They design a plan for how employees dress, how to receive shipments from trucks, and more. This helps the company work smoothly and avoid problems.\n\nSupply is the second key part of supply chain management. Supply means making decisions about how to make a product and which companies to partner with. A company may have many divisions that make different parts of a product. Managers decide which division is best for each part. They may also decide to work with other companies to make some parts. This is called outsourcing. Outsourcing helps a company make products quickly and at a low cost.",
            "The sign on the street corner says Hitler is alive in Burma. Ellen Page, a famous actress, stands alone holding a cardboard sign. She wants people to know about a problem in Burma, also called Myanmar. It is a country in Southeast Asia. A group of powerful military leaders rule the country. They took control in 1962 by overthrowing the government. Many Burmese people are opposed to their rule.\n\nIn 2007, people in the streets began to protest. The protests were led by Buddhist monks. They wore yellow robes, so the protests were called the Saffron Revolution. At first, the government allowed the monks to hold peaceful meetings. But soon, the situation became violent. The military attacked the monks and destroyed their homes. Journalists from other countries were arrested. A Japanese photographer was killed in September 2007 for taking pictures of a protest. Many more people were killed than reported.\n\nThis is not a new problem. Governments have tried to control their people for thousands of years. In ancient Rome, leaders said they were chosen by gods to rule. In Japan, the emperor was believed to be a god. Some people think our own government leader has bad advisors who want more power.\n\nWe have seen many examples of governments hurting their own people. In 1989, students and workers in China protested against the government. Many people were killed. The government said 200-300 people died, but others said 2,000-3,000 died. In Rwanda, a group of people killed many others just because of their ethnic group. Hitler's government in Germany also killed many people who were Jewish.",
            "Duke Ellington was a great jazz musician. He lived a long time and made many good music. He was very good at making music with his orchestra. Ellington played the piano in some of his songs, but he was also a great composer. He wrote music that showed how good each musician in his orchestra was. He gave each musician a special chance to play. This made his orchestra sound very good. \n\nEllington was very good at writing music that was new and exciting. He did not just write music for the whole orchestra. He also wrote music for each musician to play their own part. This made the orchestra sound very good together. His music was original and new. It was one of the best in the history of jazz.\n\nA music book says Ellington was very good at using voice as a special sound in his music. He used voice to make his music sound better. This was new at that time. Ellington was also good at making his musicians sound good on their instruments. He wrote music that fit each musician's special sound. \n\nOne of Ellington's songs, Creole Love Call, is a good example. In this song, Ellington used voice to make a special sound. He used voice like an instrument. This was one of the first times he did this. Creole Love Call is a slow song. It has six parts. Each part is different. \n\nIn the first part, the voice and the woodwind instruments talk to each other. The voice starts smooth and then gets rougher at the end. \n\nIn the second part, a trumpet player plays a solo. He plays a long note and then a short note. He makes a sad sound. \n\nIn the third part, a clarinet player plays a high note. The piano player plays a special rhythm. \n\nIn the fourth part, the whole orchestra plays. The brass and woodwind instruments talk to each other. \n\nIn the fifth part, the woodwind instruments start the conversation. The brass and rhythm instruments play a special rhythm. \n\nIn the sixth part, the voice and the woodwind instruments talk to each other again. This time the voice sounds like it is screaming. \n\nThe last part of the song is short. The voice sings a fast note and the trombone player plays a strange sound. \n\nEllington used voice to make his music sound better. This is one of the things he was good at. \n\nIn another song, Hot and Bothered, Ellington uses his skill at writing music for the whole orchestra. He also uses his ear for special sounds. A trumpet player and a singer make a special sound together. They talk to each other with their music. \n\nIn another song, It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), Ellington uses a trombone player to play the melody. The trombone player plays a special sound. \n\nEllington was a very good musician. He made many good music and was very creative.",

Now she wanted a person, not just a thing. But she did not like any boys. Some boys were interested in her. They tried to get her attention. But no one made her happy. She often thought about what could be wrong with her. She thought about it for a long time. But she could not find the answer.\n\nEvery day at home was usually calm. Her parents were kind and quiet. They did not argue with each other. They rarely argued with her. They liked her independence and her fun personality. She liked her parents, but she was very different from them.

            "This study looked at how following the \"Mediterranean Diet\" can help prevent heart disease and stroke. The Mediterranean Diet is a type of diet that includes more plant foods, such as fruits, nuts, and whole grains, and less animal products. \n\nPrevious studies showed that a Mediterranean diet helps reduce the risk of dying from heart disease. But this study is different because it looked at the connection between the diet and the risk of stroke.\n\nThe study followed 74,886 women who were between 38 and 63 years old. They were all part of a group of 121,700 nurses in 11 US states. The women answered questions about their eating habits six times between 1984 and 2004. They were asked to report what they ate during the past year. More than 95% of the women stayed in the study for the 20 years.\n\nThe researchers checked to see if the women had heart disease, a heart attack, or a stroke. They looked at medical records, hospital records, and death certificates to make sure the information was correct. If the records were not available, they counted the cases as \"probable.\"\n\nThe researchers calculated how well the women followed the Mediterranean diet by giving them a score. They then averaged the scores from the six times the women answered the questions. They adjusted the scores for things that could affect the results, like age, smoking, and physical activity.\n\nThe study showed that women who followed the Mediterranean diet closely had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. During the 20 years of the study, 2,391 women had heart disease, 1,763 had a stroke, and 1,077 died from heart disease or stroke. Women who followed the diet closely had a 29% lower risk of heart disease and stroke compared to those who did not follow the diet.",
            "In 2007, the United States had a big economic problem. Many people lost their jobs, the value of homes went down, and some of the biggest companies in America failed. This problem, called a recession, still exists today. We need to ask: how did this happen, and how can we stop it?\n\nThe economic problem was caused by bad decisions made by politicians. They pushed banks and companies to make bad loans to people who could not pay them back. These loans were given to people who did not have enough money to pay. The problem was made worse because the country's financial system was not strong enough. Two big companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, helped to sell these bad loans to other people. When the people who borrowed the money could not pay, the banks lost money and gave it to the people who bought the bad loans.\n\nThis problem started in the 1990s. The president at that time, Bill Clinton, wanted to stay in office for another term. To do this, he made it easier for people to get loans to buy homes. This made the housing market grow, but it also made it more likely for people to borrow too much money and not be able to pay it back. \n\nA reporter from the New York Times wrote in 1999: \"Fannie Mae was in trouble because it was giving loans to people who could not pay them back.\" He said that if there was a bad economy, the government might have to help Fannie Mae. This is exactly what happened.\n\nMany factors made the economy get worse. New kinds of loans and investments were created, which made it harder for people to understand what they were doing. These new loans and investments made many people put all their money in the housing market. When the housing market crashed, the people who had invested in these loans lost a lot of money.\n\nThe problem was very big. The top five banks in the United States had $4.1 trillion dollars of bad loans in 2007. This is a huge amount of money, about 30% of the country's total wealth. In the end, some of these banks were sold or forced to change how they worked. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had $5 trillion dollars of bad loans and were put under government control in 2008.",
            "Exposition is a part of a story where writers show more information about the characters, setting, or plot. But too much exposition can be boring and make readers lose interest.\n\nYou may already know the writing tip \"Show, don't tell.\" But sometimes writers still write too much information. Exposition is when a writer tells the audience what happened. It can happen in many ways, like in a movie when one character tells another a lot of information.\n\nFor example, you might be reading a story and learn that a main character met someone she loved, got married, and then her husband was killed. But instead of just saying that, the writer should show how the character felt and what she learned from her husband. This makes readers more connected to the character and care about what happens to her.\n\nIn this example, the writer might show how the husband loved his wife by what he said and did. The writer could also show how the wife felt about her husband and how he changed her life. This would make readers feel sad when he dies and more connected to the wife.\n\nAs a writer, it's your job to add meat to the story. Don't rush past important parts. If you introduce a new character, give them some history. But don't tell too much at once. For example, you might say a character used to be in the Air Force and now works at a gas station. That's a good start. You could also say he likes to fish and has big dreams. But leave some things to the reader's imagination.",
            "I watched two news programs from Columbus, Ohio. The first was a live NBC 4 newscast on August 13, 2011. The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who hurt his wife very badly. He was named Shad Hostettler. They showed his picture. He looked very bad. The news program gave this story only two minutes because it was still developing. They said he had hurt his wife many times and was arrested.\n\nThe next story was about a man named Travis Buyers, 18, who was shot in the Sharon Woods area. He was very badly hurt. The police were investigating. They had not found the person who hurt him. This story was short. I think it was short because the man who was hurt was black. I have noticed before that when a black person is a victim of a crime, they do not get much attention in the news. If a white person is a victim, the news makes a big deal about it.\n\nThe next story was about a helicopter that was hit by a bullet. The police think it happened in a certain area. They said it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. The police want people to help find the person who shot the helicopter. They are offering a five-thousand-dollar reward.\n\nThe next story was about rain and thunderstorms on Saturday. They said it would be hot all weekend.\n\nThey also told a story about a robbery at a store in Columbus. The man who robbed the store was wearing a black hoodie and was black. They said he was tall and weighed a lot.\n\nAnother story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez. He was a big time drug dealer in Texas. He was sent to prison for 300 months for selling a lot of marijuana to Ohio from Texas. They also said he was Hispanic. I do not think this was important to the story.",
            "There is a special connection between brothers. This connection is strong and never breaks. Many feelings are inside this connection. They include love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers understand each other very well. They can see themselves in each other. When a brother is in trouble, the true nature of their connection is clear. It can be good or bad. When these feelings are clear, they come with a big cost. Understanding the feelings of this brotherly connection means dealing with the bad things that happen. When a brother looks at another brother, he sees himself. This helps him see what he is really like, not what others think. The brother's actions and the problems they cause show what kind of person he is. In the story \"The Scarlet Ibis\", two brothers explore this brotherly connection and the strong feelings that come with it. They go on a difficult journey through a beautiful place. In the end, one brother survives. The story shows this theme through how the main character, the older brother, acts towards his little brother, Doodle. The story also shows the narrator's point of view, which helps us understand how the main character feels about the world and his brother. These feelings affect the main character's actions.\n\nThe main character's actions are about one feeling: pride. From the beginning, the main character is unhappy with his little brother, Doodle. Doodle is sick and cannot do the things the main character wants to do. The main character wants a brother to play with and learn from. He wants someone to be with him in the swamp and in the top of a big tree. But Doodle is too weak. He cannot do these things. The main character is very disappointed. He even thinks about hurting Doodle. But when Doodle smiles, the main character feels happy. This shows that the main character really loves his brother.",
            "The brain is a very complicated organ in the human body that helps us think and understand the world. As time went on, people used different comparisons to explain how the brain works. At first, it was like a piece of wax for writing, then a piece of paper, then a book, and now it is compared to a computer. But these comparisons are not perfect and can lead to misunderstandings.\n\nThe brain gets information from our senses. Our senses turn things like touch, heat, and light into electrical signals. These signals are changed many times in the brain as it tries to understand what they mean. For example, when you look at a picture of a black box on a white background, the brain puts together small pieces of information like color and shape to make sense of it. It then uses this information to quickly recognize the object.\n\nThe brain has a filter that decides what is important and what we should pay attention to. For example, when you look at the ground, your brain sees many blades of grass, but you do not notice them. But if someone says your name, you quickly hear it.\n\nThe brain processes information in many steps. It also uses a special attention filter to decide what information is important and what is not. There are different kinds of memory, including short-term and long-term memory. First, the brain takes in information and codes it in a way that makes sense. Then, it stores the information. There are different ways to store different kinds of information. For example, if you hear a word, your brain stores it in a way that involves how it sounds.\n\nThere are many ideas about how the brain stores and organizes knowledge. Some ideas come from how people remember things, others from computers, and others from the study of the brain itself. One idea is that the brain has a network of connections between concepts, like \"chair\" and \"table.\" These connections help us understand how things are related to each other.",
            "Aldous Huxley writes about a future world where people value community over individual freedom. This world is like a science fiction nightmare. The people in this world do not think for themselves. They are taught to be happy and not to question the system. They are controlled by a leader who calls himself the \"World Controller.\" \n\nHuxley is writing about the dangers of a system where people do not have freedom. He is saying that this system is like communism in a way. Communism is an economic system where the government controls everything. People do not have choices; they are told what to do. In Huxley's story, people are conditioned to be happy, but they are not truly happy. They are like robots. \n\nThe people in this world are divided into classes. The upper classes are smart and powerful. They have everything they need. The lower classes are not as smart and have less power. They are like machines, doing what they are told. They do not question the system.\n\nHuxley is saying that this system is bad. People should be free to make their own choices. They should be able to love and think for themselves. But in this world, love and true feelings are not allowed. People only care about how things look. They do not care about what is inside.\n\nThe people in this world are like puppets on strings. They are controlled by the system. They do not have their own thoughts or feelings. They are like machines. This is what Huxley is saying is wrong with the world. He is saying that people should be free and not controlled by the system.\n\nHuxley is using a way of thinking called Marxism. Marxism is a way of understanding how the world works. It says that the rich people control the poor people. In Huxley's story, the upper classes control the lower classes. The lower classes do what they are told, and they are happy about it. But Huxley is saying that this is not true happiness. This is a false happiness. The people in this world are not truly happy. They are just pretending to be happy.\n\nHuxley is warning us about the dangers of a system where people are controlled. He is saying that we should be free to make our own choices. We should be able to love and think for ourselves. We should not be like puppets on strings, controlled by the system.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for about two and a half years. Getting around campus can be hard. My freshman year, I lived in a dorm on the east side of campus, far from other buildings. Walking to classes in buildings like Willard, near the center of campus, took up to 25 minutes. The weather was often bad, making it even harder. I learned that not long ago, there was a lot of empty land between the dorms and other buildings. Now, this space has buildings, sports fields, and apartments. As the campus grows, it gets harder to move around. The best solution is a bicycle. But it is not enough to just have a bike. Students must ride them, and the campus must be designed for bicyclists.\n\nI talked to a friend who rides a bike again after a few years. He said, \"Bikes are great. For a while, it wasn't cool, but now it's the best way to get around.\" Bicycling is good for your body and very efficient. You can go 30 miles or more with a bowl of oatmeal and some exercise. I live off campus, near the center of campus. I bought a bike this year, and it was a good decision. Now, I can get to my class in Thomas building in 5 minutes if I ride fast. But the road to Thomas building is not always easy to ride on. I also like the idea of walking, but I am very busy. If I didn't have a bike, I would have to walk. Walking to Thomas building would take 30-40 minutes. That is over two and a half hours every week. I don't have that much time."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",

Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "I want to learn about social work. My goal is to help children who have been hurt or neglected. I also want to help families who are having problems. Important values for social workers include service, respect, and doing what is right. I want to use these values to help people and improve my skills so I can be good at my job.\n\nI have always wanted to help others. But I did not know what career to choose. I saw people in school who did not deal with their problems well. Some people used bad ways to deal with their problems. This made me choose to study psychology. After I finished college in 2009, I took a break. One day, my friend introduced me to a 16-year-old boy who was scared. He was afraid of his parents. The next day, he called the police. I went to his parents' house to help. I told the police that I had studied psychology. They asked me to talk to the parents. I asked the parents about the boy's situation. They seemed nervous and made excuses.\n\nThis experience made me think about being a social worker. I want to help children like that boy who have family problems.\n\nAnother important value for social workers is fairness. Our society says that every person is important. But we also want to be like everyone else. I am an individual and I do not like to be the same as others. In school, I tried to make a difference. I wore colorful hair, wore clothes that showed my personality, and stood up for what I believe in. I am against unfairness and I will continue to fight against it.",
            "This report explains the Biological and Sociocultural models for insomnia, a sleep disorder. The Biological model looks at genetics and medical health. The Sociocultural model examines the relationship between the environment and factors such as race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.\n\nThe report examines research on these models and explains each study. It then discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the research.\n\nInsomnia is a sleep disorder that can be caused by different things. It can be a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental problem, or a sleep disorder caused by a medical condition or a substance. \n\nThe primary sleep disorders include Dyssonmias and Parasomnias. Dyssonmias are problems with falling asleep or staying asleep. Parasomnias are sleep disorders that include behavioral and physical problems. Examples of Dyssonmias are Primary Insomnia and Primary Hypersomnia. Primary Insomnia is a problem with getting enough sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is a problem with staying awake.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders looks at genetics and how our bodies work. Research has shown that neurons in the brain called orexin help us sleep and wake up. A study on mice found that a receptor in the brain called GABAB helps us sleep. If this receptor is not working well, it can cause problems sleeping. The study found that a medicine called baclofen can help people sleep by activating the GABAB receptor.\n\nThe Sociocultural model of sleep disorders looks at how our environment affects our sleep. If the GABAB receptor is inherited, it can affect our sleep. This means that people may be more likely to have insomnia if their parents had it. This can have a big impact on our lives, especially when we have to do repetitive tasks and need to focus.",
            "This paper talks about Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, we will explain what CAPD is. Then, we will talk about how to diagnose the disorder. Finally, we will discuss how a teacher can help a student with CAPD in a regular classroom.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) is a problem with how the brain uses sound. It is not a hearing problem. People with CAPD can hear sounds, but their brain has trouble understanding them. The brain has trouble separating sounds from background noise and understanding what people are saying.\n\nThe idea of CAPD was first talked about in the 1950s. Researchers were studying children with communication problems. They started giving tests to these children in 1954. In 1961, a researcher named Kimura created a test to understand how the brain works when we hear two sounds at the same time.\n\nCAPD can cause several problems. A person with CAPD may have trouble finding the source of a sound. They may also have trouble hearing two or more sounds at the same time. It is hard for them to understand patterns in sounds. They may not be able to hear the difference in speech, like understanding sarcasm. Sometimes, one sound can cover up another sound. A person with CAPD may not be able to use sound clues to make sense of things. They may also have trouble understanding the order of sounds.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a doctor or specialist will watch how a person listens and reacts to sounds. They may also give tests to see how well the person can understand sounds. These tests may include questionnaires, watching how the person behaves, and measuring how well they can hear sounds in different situations. There is no one test that works for everyone, and we do not know what causes CAPD.\n\nA teacher in a regular classroom can help a student with CAPD in several ways. First, they can give the student extra help understanding instructions. They can also give the student time to ask questions. Teachers can also try to reduce background noise in the classroom. This can help the student with CAPD focus on what the teacher is saying. Finally, teachers can work with the student to develop strategies to help them understand and use sound clues.",
            "The play Twelfth Night says that pretending to be someone you are not can be useful for a short time, but in the end, you must be honest. If not, you could lose yourself forever. A big problem is that when you stop pretending, you may feel alone. This is because others may not understand why you tricked them. They may be angry with you. \n\nThe play questions why people pretend to be someone else. In the play, the character Viola pretends to be a man to be safe from harm. She is good at pretending, and people believe her. But she also suffers. She cannot be with the women she knows, and she makes a man, Sebastian, fall in love with her. She also has feelings for the man Orsino, but she cannot tell him. \n\nThe play shows how pretending can help people see their true feelings. For example, the woman Olivia loves Viola, who is pretending to be a man. But then she loves the real man Sebastian, who looks like Viola. This makes some people think that Olivia secretly loves women. But this may not be true. Olivia is probably just making fun of people who judge others based on how they look. \n\nThe play says that we must be honest. We must be ourselves. Trying to be someone else can cause problems and hurt others. It is better to be true and be understood and loved for who you are.",
            "The German colonial rule was very bad. It was especially bad for the Ovaherero and Nama people in German South West Africa. The German colonial rule was not the same in all the colonies. It was different in policy and in how it was run. Education in the colonies was also different. When the British took over German East Africa in 1919, they found many Africans who could read and write. The German government in other colonies also worked to educate Africans.\n\nBut the situation in South West Africa was very different. The German government did not do much to educate the local people. Instead, missionary groups helped the local people. The government did help Europeans in the colony get an education. The government built schools for them and helped the missionary schools. The German government's decision had a big effect on South West Africa. Many years later, the country still had a lot of problems because of this.\n\nOther German colonies had many educated and literate Africans. But in South West Africa, most people were not educated. They did not know how to read or write. Many things caused these problems in South West Africa. This paper wants to look at these things and learn more about the attitudes of the people in charge and the settlers.\n\nThere is a lot of writing about education in the German colonies. Most of these writings were in German and were written a long time ago. They described the education systems in the colonies. Later writings compared the education systems in different colonies. They looked at how the education systems were similar and different. One important study was done by Cohen. He compared education in South West Africa and East Africa. He said that the reason for the differences was because of the number of European settlers in South West Africa.\n\nSouth West Africa had a good climate, but it had a lot of desert. The number of Europeans living there was not very big. In 1913, only about 15,000 Europeans lived in South West Africa. Many more Europeans lived in other German colonies. For example, only 5,336 Europeans lived in East Africa.",
            "The kinds of music we call \"pop music\" have changed a lot over the last 100 years. Now we have many kinds of pop music. It is hard to make a complete list of all the kinds. Even the main kinds of pop music - like rock, country, jazz, and folk - have many smaller kinds within them.\n\nOne of the most interesting kinds of music is called Heavy Metal rock. It has a lot of emotions in it, mostly sad and dark feelings. But even though it is dark, people have made many different kinds of Heavy Metal music. They did this because it is very flexible and can be used in many ways.\n\nNow, there are many different kinds of Heavy Metal music. They have taken ideas from other kinds of music and made them their own. But Heavy Metal music started from somewhere. To understand the music we hear today, we need to know what Heavy Metal music is and why it is called a \"movement\" rather than just a kind of music.\n\nHeavy Metal music is often about darkness. It is music that is loud and strong. People who play Heavy Metal music are very good at playing their instruments. The music is different from other kinds of music because it is not simple. It has a lot of complicated parts.\n\nHeavy Metal music also came from people who used drugs to help them create their music. In the 1970s, many people used drugs, and this led to some strange and new kinds of music. The music was like a reflection of the users' feelings, which were often sad and dark. Later, other people made music that was influenced by the dark feelings of the past. They took some of the ideas from the past and used them to make new music.\n\nSome songs, like \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles, show the dark side of music. This song is considered one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to another song by the Rolling Stones, which was also very loud and dark. The Beatles wanted to show that they could make music as loud and dark as the Stones.",
            "Henri Rousseau was a French artist. He lived from 1844 to 1910. Before the Surrealist artists made famous dreamlike paintings, Rousseau worked on his own dream-inspired art. His famous painting, The Dream, shows a woman looking at the wonders of a new place in her dream. But it also shows Rousseau's own hopes and dreams as an artist.\n\nRousseau wanted people to like and accept his art. He wanted to be famous and well-known. But he faced a big problem. He could either paint like other famous artists and follow the rules, or he could be different and do his own thing. This was a problem he had all his life.\n\nTo understand The Dream, you need to know about Rousseau's life. He was born in a town in northwest France. His father was a hardware dealer. Rousseau did not go to art school. He grew up and worked for the government until he was 40. After that, he started painting to make himself happy. He wanted to escape his sad life after his first wife died. He had eight baby children who also died. He had one daughter left, Julia.\n\nRousseau's art was different from other artists. He painted simple things and was a bit like a folk artist. He wanted to be accepted by the art world. But he had to compete with other famous artists like Matisse. Matisse was a talented artist who did not want to paint in a boring way. Rousseau, on the other hand, wanted to paint in a way that would make him famous.\n\nRousseau finally got recognition when he was older. But it was not until Matisse was already famous. A writer named Jan Gordon said that Rousseau's goal was to paint in a way that was safe and accepted by everyone. He wanted to be part of the French art group.",
            "Many great thinkers believe that ethics and art are connected. They think that truth and beauty are closely related. I agree with this idea. A poet named John Keats said, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty.\" He said this in a poem about a special cup. He means that beauty and truth are the same thing. We learn many things in life from education and experience. But we like or dislike art and morals without being taught. Both ethics and aesthetics try to explain, not tell us what to do. We try to understand why a piece of art is beautiful or why an action is good, rather than following rules. \n\nWe can't fully explain why something is good or beautiful. Critics of art or morals can't say exactly what makes something good. They might talk about things like how an artist uses color or background. But these things don't explain why something is good. When people talk about their favorite art or literature, they often say, \"There's something about it.\" Then they give more details. I think that art and morals can't be explained completely. We can't say everything about why something is good or beautiful. A writer, Flannery O'Connor, said, \"You tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" We tell a story to say something that can't be said in another way. I think ethics is the same. A philosopher, Wittgenstein, said, \"Ethics can't be explained. Ethics is beyond words.\" I think that this \"something\" is what makes art and morality so powerful. It's this \"something\" that connects them.\n\nI believe that ethics and art are closely related because they affect us deeply. We can't fully understand them, but we can feel them. This is especially true for literature. Literature is special because it deals with values. We learn values from literature, and that's why it's so important.",
            "Germany is a strong country today. It is united with its own culture. This culture is from many different groups that lived in the area near the Alps in München to the city of Kiel on the Baltic Sea. You can feel the same culture in Köln on the Rhine River and in the city of Dresden on the Elbe River. This is not surprising because Germany's culture comes from many different sources, including old tribes.\n\nThe land of the Germans is called Germania. We do not know for sure how the name came to be. Some people think it came from a Germanic tribe. Others believe it came from the word for a spear, which the Germans used in war. It may also have come from an old Irish word that means \"to shout.\" The Germans were known to be loud.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote about the Germans in his book. He said that the Germans were an ancient group of people and not a mix of different groups. They were living in Germany when the Romans arrived. The Romans came to Germany to trade and to take things from the land. They also sent soldiers to fight in Germany, but they mostly went back to Rome.\n\nThe Germanic tribes began to appear in the first century. They lived near the Roman Empire and traded their goods. Some Germans also served in the Roman army.",
            "I looked down and saw a picture in front of me. My mind was empty and not thinking about anything. I was watching the picture without feeling any strong emotions. My mind was working well, like a machine. I was looking at the picture, but I was not thinking about it in a special way.\n\nI once got an art book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" An artist friend told me to get it. The book teaches people how to draw. It says to use a square to help you look at a picture. This helps you see the picture in a simple way. It makes the picture smaller and easier to understand.\n\nI was looking at a bowl of fruit on a table. But I could not think of the square to put around the picture. I was too surprised. I stood and looked at the picture in wonder.\n\nSome artists, like Picasso, like blue. Others, like Monet, like green. The old masters in Italy liked many colors. If I wanted to be a good artist, this was my chance. This was the start of my picture, my story, called \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy hand moved to get a pencil. My hand moved to the toilet to draw. But my hand hit the toilet handle again and again. The brown package was stuck. I was very frustrated.\n\nI held a mop, and I was thinking about the brown package. It was a waste of food. Someone had left it in the toilet at the Rite Aid store. I wanted it to go away. I wanted to clean it up.\n\nI looked at the wall and took some toilet paper. My hand went into the toilet to try and get the package. I was careful, like a mom taking out a turkey for Thanksgiving.",
            "Many young drivers die in car accidents.  Several things combine to cause this problem.  The National Institutes of Health say one reason is that young brains are not ready for the dangers of driving.  Young people also do not have much experience driving.  This lack of experience causes more car accidents and more severe injuries.  Teens do worse when they drive with their friends.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center studied this.  They found a connection between the age of the passenger and the number of car accidents.\n\nCalifornia and other states try to make driving safer for young people.  They do this by giving temporary licenses that limit the hours young people can drive and do not allow other young passengers.\n\nBut these temporary licenses are not enough.  The real problem is that young people are not good at handling the risks and responsibilities of driving.  A psychologist named Marvin Zuckerman says 18 years old is too young for a regular driver's license.  He says young people under 19 or 20 often want to take risks because it is exciting.  This means we should delay giving driver's licenses to young teens.  If we do not, there will be more car accidents and the number of deaths will be very high.  By 2010, many new teen drivers will be on the road.\n\nWe can make a law to fix this problem.  Schools can teach driver's education classes.  But no one under 18 can drive a car.  A temporary permit can still be given before a full driver's license.  Young people must also get a certain number of hours of practice with a licensed driver.  The number of hours can be the same as the number of hours most states require.  A national law would be a good way to keep young people safe across the country.\n\nThis idea is not new.  But it can help save lives.",
            "The Library of Congress has a collection of early Edison films. I looked through them. I found 15 trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films use creative editing to create illusions. I studied these films to learn about their style and growth. Most trick films from this time are set in a fixed frame. The camera does not move to follow people or objects. The style comes from theater and vaudeville shows.\n\nIn some films, actors move side to side. They do not walk towards or away from the camera. An example is the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right and move back and forth.\n\nThe camera does not follow the actors when they leave the frame. Trick films usually show the whole scene at one time. They do not use close-up shots like we see in modern movies. This style comes from theater and vaudeville. The performers stay in the middle of the stage and do not move towards the camera.\n\nMost early trick films show one scene at a time. This means they are usually short, only a minute or less. The films show simple tricks, like magic and disappearing acts. But sometimes, one scene is made up of many small parts. A good example is The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895). If you look closely, you can see where the camera starts to show Mary's head being cut off.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a strong supporter of Republican ideas.  He was a farmer, but he also worked in politics.  These two things made him known for his strong opinions about personal freedom and government.  He believed that farming was the best job.  This idea influenced his thoughts about government.  He wanted to protect and help this kind of job.\n\nTaylor thought the United States had a great chance to create a perfect system of government.  There was no old way of doing things to get in the way.  He believed in the basic rights of people.  These rights are like a team.  If one right is not fair, all the others are not good either.  He said the government should not control these rights.\n\nTaylor said that some people with power and evil ideas would take advantage of others in nature.  But in a society, this should not happen.  To make a good society, the government must understand both good and bad in people.  Taylor thought government is like people.  It can be good or bad, depending on how it is run.\n\nTaylor believed that a good government protects property, helps farming, and does not support capitalism.  He thought a good government would be fair, no matter who is in charge.  He believed that self-interest is a bad thing when it hurts others.  But it is not always bad.  A good government can keep this self-interest from making problems.\n\nTaylor wanted the government to be limited.  He did not want the government to have more power than the Constitution said it could have.  He thought a big government would be expensive and could be cruel.  But he also thought a simple, strict reading of the Constitution could be bad.  Without understanding the ideas of the people who wrote it, this way of looking at the Constitution could be unfair.  Taylor thought the Declaration of Independence was more important than the Constitution.  It said that the United States is a group of states, not one country.",
            "We look at Figure 17. There was a big drop in the number of people who used the commuter log in the third month of the project. This was not good news. It is hard to say why this happened. We know that winter came to the campus in New England. Fewer people ride bikes or walk during the winter. This might be one reason for the drop. Students and teachers were busy in December. They were finishing school and getting grades. They may have forgotten to fill out the log. December is also the start of the holiday time. Many students and teachers do not need to come to campus for a month. Classes start again in late January. This might also be a reason for the low number of logs. But we still do not know why there were few logs in February. People might get excited about a new project at the beginning. Then, their interest might decrease. We tried to make the project more interesting in March with the Carpool Challenge Week. We got more logs for that month. This shows that we need to find a way to keep people interested in the project. We also need to consider the fact that people like to drive cars. This is a part of our culture. We need to give people good reasons to use other ways of commuting. We gave prizes like gift cards to local stores. We gave out these prizes throughout the project. It would have been interesting to see if bigger prizes would have made more people participate. For example, if we had given away a bike or a new car, we might have gotten more people to use the commuter log. We did not change the prizes during the project. If we had said that we would give better prizes in the future, people might have been more interested.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a type of investment. It follows an index, a product, or a group of things like an index fund. But it is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange. You get the benefits of many investments and the ability to own a single stock. You can sell some, buy more, and buy as little as one share at a time. ETFs are also less expensive than mutual funds. But you must pay a fee for trading them. There are many different types of ETFs available.\n\nWe are looking at the ETF IHF and its top 10 holdings that make up 63.58% of its assets. We want to know if owning this one ETF is the same as owning a group of its top 10 stocks. We also want to know if there are better ways to invest in these same stocks.\n\nTo make it easier, we will only look at the top 10 holdings. Below, you can see the top 10 stocks and the percentage of the ETF's assets they make up.\n\nWe can use a chart to see how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF. We can use the percentages to calculate the returns and risk of a portfolio made up only of these 10 stocks. The chart shows the results.\n\nThe chart shows that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could get a 6.11% higher return than the ETF. It also shows that its risk is 0.12 lower. This means that owning just the top 10 holdings could be a good choice. But we need to be sure that the differences are real. To do this, we need to check the standard deviation of each stock. This will tell us if the differences are important or not.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe wrote a poem called \"Dream-Land\". This is one of his good poems. He used a word \"Thulé\" in his poem. Poe said he got this word from the writer Virgil. Virgil used it to describe an island north of Britain. But Poe learned from another writer, Gothe. \n\nGothe was a famous German writer. Poe liked his work. Gothe wrote a poem called \"Faust\". It was published in two parts. The second part came out after Gothe died in 1832. There is a short poem in \"Faust\" called \"The King of Thulé\". It is about a king who loses his wife. He drinks a lot and cries about his dead wife. He then decides to die. He gives away all his things, except a special cup. He goes to a cliff, throws the cup into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. Poe's poem \"Dream-Land\" is similar to \"The King of Thulé\". Maybe this is because Poe had lost someone and drank a lot like the king. \n\nPoe used the word Thule in two of his poems. He said \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\". He used it twice in \"Dream-Land\", at the beginning and the end. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be read together. In \"Dream-Land\", the speaker talks about a dark and lonely place called Thule. He sees dead friends and a world without color. This is like what happens in \"The King of Thulé\". The king is lonely because his wife died. He lost his will to rule or live. \n\nGothe was a well-known writer. Poe would have read his work. Poe liked Tennyson, and Tennyson liked Gothe. Poe would have been interested in Gothe's work because of this connection.",
            "A customer in California was hurt when she slipped and fell on applesauce in a store. The store manager, Martin, was informed about the spill twice, but he did not clean it. He was eating dinner at the time. Can this customer get extra money from the store for being hurt? The answer is yes. She can argue that the store manager should have known that not cleaning the spill would cause harm. Many people had slipped and fallen in the store before. \n\nTo get extra money, the customer must show that the store manager acted on purpose and knew that his action would hurt someone. A court will not quickly reject her claim. The customer can say that the store manager should have cleaned the spill, even if it took some time. He should have known that not cleaning it would be a problem.\n\nThe store manager said he was busy eating dinner. But, he had been told about the spill twice. He ignored the problem. The customer slipped and fell 30 minutes later. This is not a good excuse. Many people had slipped and fallen in the store before, and the manager should have taken action.\n\nCalifornia law says a customer can get extra money if the store manager acted with malice. Malice means the manager wanted to hurt someone or showed a bad disregard for the customer's safety. In this case, the customer can argue that the manager did not take the spill seriously and put many people in danger. \n\nThe law in California says a court must consider if the store manager's actions were wrong and intended to cause harm. The customer can argue that the manager was aware that not cleaning the spill would cause harm and did not care. This is enough to make a claim for extra money.\n\nIn this case, six people slipped and fell in the store in one year. The manager did not take action to fix the problem. This is a good reason to argue that the manager acted with malice. He showed a bad disregard for the customers' safety.\n\nIn summary, the customer has a good chance to get extra money from the store for being hurt. She can argue that the store manager acted with malice and ignored the spill. This was a bad decision that put many people in danger.",
            "Four years ago, I took a class about Islam at CBC. A big question in the class was if Islam is a hostile religion. I think this question is still important today. Looking back at what happened since 9/11, I see that the media's view of Islam changed a great deal. From being very critical, it became more accepting. It's hard to believe that in 2001, a president with a Muslim background like Barack Obama could have run for office.\n\nI'm interested in the story of the Prophet Muhammad. What I learned about him seems different from his personality. I thought he forced people to become Muslims. He would win battles and then make the defeated tribes join his religion. But his story says he was a humble and kind man. He didn't try to prove himself, but lived a simple life with miracles. This makes me think the writers wanted people to see him as a special person, but it takes away from the legend of Jesus.\n\nThere are many stories in the biography that seem like they are trying to show how people believed in Muhammad on their own. But the problem is that many of these stories come from people who heard from others. This makes the stories seem less real. I don't like this because it makes it seem like they are trying to hide the truth.\n\nI have a big problem with the way the biography presents Muhammad. It says he was a kind and wise man, but history shows that he was not. I wonder if Muslims know the real story of how he became powerful.",
            "The ideas of Jesus were not kept after he died. The Christian way of thinking changed quickly. If we look at the past, we see that Christianity moved away from its roots. Today, we see a growing understanding and a new way of thinking. Many traditional people will not change. They will not accept new ideas. But they are not the majority. More and more people will be interested in the real meaning of Christianity. In the future, many people will want to know what Jesus truly said. They will want to separate the ideas added to Christianity over time from the true meaning of the religion. It may take time, but this will happen. Christianity will go back to its original form. A movement will start to remove extra ideas. It will be like going back in time. Only the ideas of Jesus will be left. When this happens in the United States and Europe, many people will follow Jesus' ideas as if they lived in his time. The church will remain strong to guide people. But the church will be more simple. There will be less difference between different groups. People will be more alike in what they believe. This is not the first time this has happened. The Roman Empire persecuted Christians, but later became Christian. Our country has changed from slave to leader. The same thing will happen in the Christian church. People will go back to the source. They will not care about different groups and ideas. To make this happen, people will start to understand Jesus' words as examples, not as real things. If we look far back in time, we only see Judaism. This is the base of the Christian religion. The idea of one god, the power of the Bible, and the authority of Jewish leaders were all important parts of Judaism before the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish people were not all the same. They had different groups like Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and many common people.",
            "The Jungle shows that people are naturally selfish and only think about themselves. They want to make their lives better, but they do not care about others. The book shows this in many ways. One example is the owners and managers of big factories. They only want to make their companies bigger and better. They do not care about anything that gets in their way or gets hurt. They do not care about the air pollution or the dirty water from the factory animals. \n\nThe owners and managers also do not care about their workers. They pay them very little and make them work long hours. They can fire workers without warning and without giving them any help finding a new job. During that time, there were no laws to protect workers. This meant the owners and managers could do what they wanted. The workers lived and worked in bad conditions. They did not have any help or information about their rights. Some workers formed unions, but they often made money from the poor workers. The workers were treated very badly and had no way to escape the system.\n\nThe Jungle says that people in this situation are like slaves. They are poor and do not have many opportunities. They depend on the owners and managers for their lives. That means they have to do what they are told, even if it is bad for them. The book says that in this situation, bad behavior is common and expected.",
            "F. Scott Fitzgerald uses different methods to make readers feel a certain way about important things. He\nuses many of these methods in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs words together\nto make a new meaning. He uses this to give a special feeling around a subject. Fitzgerald also uses\nsymbols and gives them meaning. Then he uses the same symbol for the same feeling. He does this with\nmany colors, like gold, green, white, gray, red, and pink.\n\nFitzgerald uses white and gray to show sameness. White means nice and high class, but gray means old\nand faded. He starts to show this in the beginning of the novel. He uses these colors many times. Daisy\nand Jordan wear white all the time. Nick wears white clothes to Gatsby's party. Tom wears a white shirt\nwhen he meets Myrtle. Fitzgerald uses these colors on many ordinary things, like a white chasm in New\nYork, gray cars, and gray land.\n\nAfter he shows the meaning of white and gray, he uses them to show that something is not important.\nHe starts with Daisy. He does not use these colors for a long time, and then he describes Daisy as wearing\nwhite. This shows that Daisy is not a special character, but just someone Gatsby wants.\n\nFitzgerald uses this technique again to show that Daisy is not special. For example, he describes her fur\ncollar as gray and her dress as white. He wants readers to see Daisy as just another person, not as a\nspecial person.",
            "San Diego County is a good place for growing food. The climate is mild and sunny. People grow many foods there. These include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy green vegetables, squash, broccoli, herbs, fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. Many people in the area want to buy organic food from local farms. Some farmers have long waiting lists for their community-supported agriculture programs. People also buy organic eggs and milk from these farmers.\n\nSome of these farms allow visitors to see how they grow food. People can also walk, hike, or watch birds on the farms. This helps the farmers make extra money and teach others about their work.\n\nOrganic farming is good for the environment. It helps plants and animals in the area. This is because it does not use chemicals in the soil and water. But organic farming can be more expensive than farming with chemicals. It needs more work and management to stop pests and weeds and make the soil healthy without chemicals. Organic farms also have higher losses than big farms that use chemicals. \n\nThe land chosen for this project is near the town of Potrero in San Diego County. It is 160 acres of land with chaparral, grass, and oak trees. The area is near the Cleveland National Forest. Many animals live there. Some are endangered and need our help. The area was once home to Native Americans and later to cattle ranchers and people who sold wood.\n\nI chose this land from a website and looked at government programs that can help small farmers. I found a real farm in the area that grows organic food. This farm is a model for what a farmer in the area might do to make a living and help the environment.",
            "Culture is very important in negotiations. It is not easy to define culture. It is not the same everywhere. Culture is not just one thing. We should not say that all people from a certain country are the same. For example, we should not say, \"All Russians are stubborn\" or \"All Japanese are very polite.\" It is better to understand the culture of a country and how it affects a negotiation.\n\nWhen we go to a new country, we see their culture in a way that makes sense to us. We make comparisons with our own culture. To understand a foreign culture, we can learn about its history or its problems. We should not judge or try to change their culture. We should accept it and work with it. This is especially true when we are in a weaker position in a negotiation.\n\nCulture is not just about countries. Companies also have their own cultures. A company's culture can be very different from another company's culture. Some companies work very hard, while others have a more relaxed schedule. We can see a company's culture in the way its employees dress, communicate, and work. Some companies want their employees to help others, but others do not.\n\nValues are very important to understand. They explain why people behave in certain ways. If people in a culture value saving face or being kind to each other, they will not do things that might hurt others. If people value hard work, they will try to get a good deal in a negotiation. We should think about these values before we start a negotiation. But we should also try to understand our opponent on a personal level to be successful in a negotiation.",
            "The Bible says, \"The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This idea is from Psalm 14. A Christian philosopher named St. Anselm used this idea in his argument about God's existence. We will also discuss Thomas Aquinas, who also believed in God. Both of their ideas are about the same God in the Bible. To compare their ideas, let's assume that they are both right.\n\nSt. Anselm's idea is that God exists in our minds. He says we can know God exists because we can think about God. This idea is based on faith. Faith is believing in something without proof.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas has a different idea. He says we can know God exists by using our reason and looking at the world around us. We do not need faith. He gives five reasons for God's existence. These reasons are change, cause, chance, perfection, and order. He says these reasons show that we need God. For example, imagine you have a puzzle with most of the pieces. If you know the whole picture, you can know what the missing piece is like.\n\nIn this way, St. Aquinas says we can know God exists using our minds and what we see in the world.",
            "Buddha was born in the fifth or sixth century BCE. He was a prince. Later in life, he gave up his position in the world and became a wise man. This man's teachings led to the creation of Buddhism. One part of Buddhism is called Theravada Buddhism. This religion is about 2,500 years old. It is different from what it was when Buddha was alive. You can see these changes in Theravada countries like Sri Lanka.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, a yearly ceremony is held. It is called the water-cutting ceremony. Monks and ordinary people take part in this ceremony. But Buddha never taught about a ceremony like this. These changes are not only in small things. They are in the main ideas of the religion too.\n\nThe Theravada Buddhist community has changed its ideas over time. This happened both from inside and outside the community. Inside the community, changes came from people who are Buddhist. Outside the community, changes came from people who are not Buddhist. Changes that are good for the community are called benign. Changes that are bad for the community are called hostile.\n\nTo understand this better, we need to know some key ideas. \n\nInternal means something that comes from inside the Buddhist community. External means something that comes from outside the community. Hostile means something that hurts the community. Benign means something that does not hurt the community, even if it has a bad effect.\n\nNow, let's look at the main ideas of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists believe in three important things: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is a collection of Buddhist teachings. It includes three groups of books: the Sutta Pitaka, the Vinaya Pitaka, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka.\n\nThe Sutta Pitaka has teachings that are like conversations. The Vinaya Pitaka has rules for Buddhist monks and nuns. The Abhidhamma Pitaka has ideas about the universe. Some of these ideas are that everything is not permanent, that life is hard, and that people have no soul.\n\nTo end the cycle of death and rebirth, people must understand these ideas. They must also understand that desire, hatred, and confusion are the causes of suffering. To stop suffering, people must give up these things. The Vinaya Pitaka has rules for lay Buddhists. These rules say do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not be lazy, and do not take drugs. Monks have more rules to follow.\n\nThe most important idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. The first truth is that life is suffering. The second truth is that attachment causes suffering. The third truth is that suffering can be ended.",
            "The United States and Mexico are two countries with a long history of rivalry. This rivalry lasted 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. The two countries had many fights. The biggest fight was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848. The United States won this war and got Texas and the American Southwest. \n\nThe rivalry began because of disagreements about religion, culture, and tradition. The two countries had different ideas about these things. They also had big problems with material goods. The United States and Mexico are not the only countries that have a big rivalry with a neighbor. Many countries that share a border have problems like this.\n\nDavid M. Pletcher says, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba do we find long-lasting American diplomatic problems.\" Both Mexico and Cuba are close to the United States. They have been rivals to the United States for a long time. Other countries in Latin America have good relations with the United States.\n\nReligion was a big problem between the two countries. The United States and Mexico had different ideas about what is right. This has been a problem for many countries throughout history. Sally Frahm says, \"If Americans were against fascism and communism in the twentieth century, they were against Catholicism and monarchy in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.\" The United States and Mexico had a rivalry based on their different ideas about religion. This was because of the distrust between the English and Spanish.\n\nThe United States and Mexico had many problems. They had 17 fights between 1836 and 1893. Most of these fights were about territory and border problems. Outlaws and bandits from the United States had problems on the border. This was a big problem until both countries used their military to control the border.\n\nThe rivalry between the United States and Mexico ended as Mexico became dependent on the United States. The United States changed its goals from expanding its territory to helping Mexico economically. This change happened in the later part of the 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I got sick. I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen nursing because I wanted a safe and secure job. Many people told me that nursing was a good job because people will always get sick. \n\nBut I had bigger dreams. I wanted to be a scientist or a journalist. However, I chose nursing. I am now 61 years old and unable to work. I get money from Social Security, but I have no savings. Every day is a struggle.\n\nI have been lucky because my family and some friends have helped me. But when something bad happens, you feel very weak. \n\nMy point is that life is full of emergencies. We cannot be sure of the future. We need to be prepared, but some problems are too big for one person to solve alone.\n\nI agree that we should not rely too much on big government. But I think we should try to trust each other more. We should help each other and ask for help when we need it. \n\nSome people say that America was built on rugged individualism. But it was really about helping each other and sharing what we have. The people who traveled across the country in wagons did not do it alone. They worked together.\n\nSo, be prepared. I have a disaster kit and first aid supplies. I also have food and water for a long time. If you have a big piece of land, you can grow your own food and store it for later. This is a good idea. But it is also important to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do living things change over time? Are there rules that guide the way they change? Many scientists have tried to understand this, but it is still a hard problem. Recently, some scientists have used math to study how animals grow and change. They looked at the shells of a certain type of animal called Prunum. The scientists want to know how these animals change over time and how their shells develop. They used special pictures of the shells to create math models. These models can help them understand how the animals' shells grow and change. The scientists also did experiments to learn more about the animals and their shells.\n\nA shell is like a tube that moves through space over time. It turns around in a circle, like a spiral. This spiral is divided into parts called whorls. Each whorl is like a ring that grows as the animal gets older. The whorls turn around a middle line that runs through the shell. This line is called the columella. The speed at which the whorls grow can be different, and a line separates each whorl. This line is called a suture. The last whorl of the shell is the biggest one. The spire is all the whorls except the last one. The tip of the spire is called the apex, and the other end is called the base. The animal comes out of its shell through a hole called the aperture.\n\nWe can look at shells in different ways. We can look at the top, the bottom, the front, or the back. Most of the time, we look at the front of the shell. When we look at the shell from the front, the aperture is open, and the apex is pointing up.\n\nTo measure the whorls, we look at the shell from the top and find where the first line is. Then we draw a line to divide the shell. We count the whorls from this line, and we can estimate the number of whorls to one-quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell is like a path that the animal follows as it grows. We can trace this path by looking at the center of each whorl and the size of the aperture. We can draw this path and use math to understand how the animal's shell grows. Once we have a math formula, we can change the parameters and see how the shell would grow differently.",
            "Indonesia's rate of death for newborn babies and infants has not improved much in the last ten years.  The country is doing well in some areas, like making clean water and sanitation available.  But the country is not making good progress in improving health for mothers and children.  Indonesia is not meeting its goals for improving health by 2015.  There are many reasons for this.  They will be explained below.\n\nIndonesia has made some progress in the number of births where a health worker is present.  Now, 72% of births have a worker like a nurse or a midwife.  But this does not mean all of these workers can give medical help if a mother or baby gets sick.  Many mothers and babies still die from bleeding during delivery.  This means the progress made in this area is not really very good.  Indonesia's health department also has a problem with treating children under five who have diarrhea.  Many children in the country do not get help from a health worker.  The country also does not have good records about taking care of mothers after they give birth.\n\nMany mothers do not have a cesarean operation when they need it.  In fact, only 4% of mothers have this operation.  The number of cesarean operations is higher in cities than in villages.  This shows that many people in villages do not have access to healthcare.  Many people can not afford healthcare because they have to pay out of their own money.  This is a big problem in Indonesia.\n\nTo improve health for mothers and babies, the government needs to decide what to do.  One idea is to help with specific programs for mothers and babies.  But this might not be the best idea.  Programs that focus on one area of health can be more effective and give faster results.  But they can also have some problems.  One problem is that they might take money and workers away from other areas of healthcare.  Another problem is that many programs can cause confusion and extra work.",
            "Victorian novels often look at small details. But two books, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, are different. They have mystery and strange things that are not common in other Victorian novels. This makes the characters more interesting and helps us understand their thoughts and feelings.\n\nOne time, Oliver Twist had many confusing ideas in his mind. He was walking with two men, Sikes and Crackit, who were arguing. Oliver thought he was still with them, but then he heard gunshots and people shouting. He felt pain and was taken away. This happened many times, and Oliver felt scared and in pain.\n\nOliver's dreams or strange times like these often tell us something about his feelings and problems. In one chapter, Oliver remembers being shot. He relives the moment like it's a dream. This shows how Oliver had no control over what happened to him. He was in a lot of pain and was taken away without knowing what was happening.\n\nOliver's life is hard. He has little control over things. He can't even try to take care of himself when his life is in danger. This makes us think that Oliver gives up easily. Maybe someone else is controlling him, making him feel this way.\n\nAnother time, Oliver says, \"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\" This means that time goes by quickly when you are in a bad situation. Oliver feels like he is trapped in a long night that is not ending.",
            "I worked in an after-school program two years ago. I helped students who needed help in different subjects. But my strengths were in English and reading. One boy, Adrian, had trouble reading. He was in third or fourth grade. I think he was having a big problem. Some letters he could read well, but not others. This was strange.\n\nAdrian spoke perfect English, but I learned that his mother did not speak English. She spoke only Spanish. I know a little Spanish, but not much. We talked a little. Then I understood the problem. Adrian could read, but he did not know the English alphabet well.\n\nI share this story to talk about the problem of language barriers in schools. Even students who speak good English can still have trouble reading. I think everyone agrees this is a problem. What can we do? For Adrian, the answer was simple. He needed help with reading and the alphabet.\n\nBut for students who do not speak much English, the answer is not simple. There is no one solution. We need to try many things. These are bilingual education, English as a Second Language (ESL) classes, and private tutors. We need to use all of these things together.\n\nOne good idea is bilingual education. This is when students learn in two languages. This helps students do well in school. Some people are afraid of this idea. They think it is a waste of money and that most students will not benefit. But this is not true. If we used this idea in all schools, all students would benefit.\n\nHow can we make this happen? Do we need all teachers to speak two languages? No, this would be hard. But we can have special helpers who speak two languages. These helpers can work with students who need extra help.",
            "Most of us learn as children that there is something bigger than us.  We may go to Sunday school or the Temple to learn about it.  Some people search for answers inside themselves.  Many people accept the religion their parents teach.  But some people reject it.  They do not believe there is something beyond what they know.  We may change our minds and choose a different way.  Every person chooses a path to understand spirituality in their own way.  We look for a light in the dark to guide us.\n\nI asked my father about his favorite bird one day.  We were on our front porch, listening to the rain.  He stared out into the rain.  He looked thin and tired.  His hair was thinning.  I felt sad and afraid.

I wanted my father to be happy, not sad and weak.  I curled up in bed for three days and waited for the news.  No one called me to tell me about my father's death.",
            "The Gothic Novel is called an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New'\" by Ian Watt. This means it is a mix of old and new things. The Gothic style has been both praised and criticized. Some people think it has no real meaning, while others say it is powerful and exciting. The first Gothic Novel was written by Horace Walpole. He combined old ideas from medieval times with new ideas from modern novels. This created a new way of writing.\n\nHorace Walpole's book, The Castle of Otranto, used old theatrical ideas and new ways to write about nature. He called it \"A Gothic Story.\" The Gothic style uses old ideas from medieval times, like theater and architecture. Many people thought the word \"gothic\" was old-fashioned and not sophisticated. But the combination of old and new made the Gothic style stay popular for a long time.\n\nOne important idea in Gothic novels is chivalry. Chivalry is a set of rules for knights to follow. It includes being brave, honorable, and strong. Gothic writers liked this idea because it showed a perfect person. They wanted to show how society was not perfect and that we need to be better. The writer of The Castle of Otranto, Horace Walpole, was worried about the future. He thought the world was not a good place. He used the idea of chivalry to show how we should be better. The main character, Frederic, is a prince who has suffered a lot. He is brave, kind, and strong like a knight. This is an example of how the Gothic style uses old ideas to make a new kind of story.",
            "Supply chain management is the process of moving goods from the customer to the final product. It includes many steps: getting raw materials, making the product, storing it, and sending it to the customer. The idea of supply chain management was created in 1982 by a man named Keith Oliver. He said that the goal is to satisfy customers quickly and efficiently.\n\nThere are six key parts of a supply chain. They are production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these parts to serve customers well.\n\nProduction is the first step. It is the beginning of the supply chain process. Managers must know what customers want. They look at the market to find out. The market tells them what customers need. Once managers understand what customers want, they decide what products to make and how many. They must choose where to make the products and which factory will work best. They think about the customer's needs and wants.\n\nAfter deciding where to make the products, managers focus on planning work and taking care of machines. Production is a very important part of the supply chain. Every detail is important. If details are not planned well, the company may lose time and money. For example, a company like Wal-Mart has a plan for everything. They design a plan for how employees dress, how to receive shipments from trucks, and more. This helps the company work smoothly and avoid problems.\n\nSupply is the second key part of supply chain management. Supply means making decisions about how to make a product and which companies to partner with. A company may have many divisions that make different parts of a product. Managers decide which division is best for each part. They may also decide to work with other companies to make some parts. This is called outsourcing. Outsourcing helps a company make products quickly and at a low cost.",
            "The sign on the street corner says Hitler is alive in Burma. Ellen Page, a famous actress, stands alone holding a cardboard sign. She wants people to know about a problem in Burma, also called Myanmar. It is a country in Southeast Asia. A group of powerful military leaders rule the country. They took control in 1962 by overthrowing the government. Many Burmese people are opposed to their rule.\n\nIn 2007, people in the streets began to protest. The protests were led by Buddhist monks. They wore yellow robes, so the protests were called the Saffron Revolution. At first, the government allowed the monks to hold peaceful meetings. But soon, the situation became violent. The military attacked the monks and destroyed their homes. Journalists from other countries were arrested. A Japanese photographer was killed in September 2007 for taking pictures of a protest. Many more people were killed than reported.\n\nThis is not a new problem. Governments have tried to control their people for thousands of years. In ancient Rome, leaders said they were chosen by gods to rule. In Japan, the emperor was believed to be a god. Some people think our own government leader has bad advisors who want more power.\n\nWe have seen many examples of governments hurting their own people. In 1989, students and workers in China protested against the government. Many people were killed. The government said 200-300 people died, but others said 2,000-3,000 died. In Rwanda, a group of people killed many others just because of their ethnic group. Hitler's government in Germany also killed many people who were Jewish.",
            "Duke Ellington was a great jazz musician. He lived a long time and made many good music. He was very good at making music with his orchestra. Ellington played the piano in some of his songs, but he was also a great composer. He wrote music that showed how good each musician in his orchestra was. He gave each musician a special chance to play. This made his orchestra sound very good. \n\nEllington was very good at writing music that was new and exciting. He did not just write music for the whole orchestra. He also wrote music for each musician to play their own part. This made the orchestra sound very good together. His music was original and new. It was one of the best in the history of jazz.\n\nA music book says Ellington was very good at using voice as a special sound in his music. He used voice to make his music sound better. This was new at that time. Ellington was also good at making his musicians sound good on their instruments. He wrote music that fit each musician's special sound. \n\nOne of Ellington's songs, Creole Love Call, is a good example. In this song, Ellington used voice to make a special sound. He used voice like an instrument. This was one of the first times he did this. Creole Love Call is a slow song. It has six parts. Each part is different. \n\nIn the first part, the voice and the woodwind instruments talk to each other. The voice starts smooth and then gets rougher at the end. \n\nIn the second part, a trumpet player plays a solo. He plays a long note and then a short note. He makes a sad sound. \n\nIn the third part, a clarinet player plays a high note. The piano player plays a special rhythm. \n\nIn the fourth part, the whole orchestra plays. The brass and woodwind instruments talk to each other. \n\nIn the fifth part, the woodwind instruments start the conversation. The brass and rhythm instruments play a special rhythm. \n\nIn the sixth part, the voice and the woodwind instruments talk to each other again. This time the voice sounds like it is screaming. \n\nThe last part of the song is short. The voice sings a fast note and the trombone player plays a strange sound. \n\nEllington used voice to make his music sound better. This is one of the things he was good at. \n\nIn another song, Hot and Bothered, Ellington uses his skill at writing music for the whole orchestra. He also uses his ear for special sounds. A trumpet player and a singer make a special sound together. They talk to each other with their music. \n\nIn another song, It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), Ellington uses a trombone player to play the melody. The trombone player plays a special sound. \n\nEllington was a very good musician. He made many good music and was very creative.",

            "This study looked at how following the \"Mediterranean Diet\" can help prevent heart disease and stroke. The Mediterranean Diet is a type of diet that includes more plant foods, such as fruits, nuts, and whole grains, and less animal products. \n\nPrevious studies showed that a Mediterranean diet helps reduce the risk of dying from heart disease. But this study is different because it looked at the connection between the diet and the risk of stroke.\n\nThe study followed 74,886 women who were between 38 and 63 years old. They were all part of a group of 121,700 nurses in 11 US states. The women answered questions about their eating habits six times between 1984 and 2004. They were asked to report what they ate during the past year. More than 95% of the women stayed in the study for the 20 years.\n\nThe researchers checked to see if the women had heart disease, a heart attack, or a stroke. They looked at medical records, hospital records, and death certificates to make sure the information was correct. If the records were not available, they counted the cases as \"probable.\"\n\nThe researchers calculated how well the women followed the Mediterranean diet by giving them a score. They then averaged the scores from the six times the women answered the questions. They adjusted the scores for things that could affect the results, like age, smoking, and physical activity.\n\nThe study showed that women who followed the Mediterranean diet closely had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. During the 20 years of the study, 2,391 women had heart disease, 1,763 had a stroke, and 1,077 died from heart disease or stroke. Women who followed the diet closely had a 29% lower risk of heart disease and stroke compared to those who did not follow the diet.",
            "In 2007, the United States had a big economic problem. Many people lost their jobs, the value of homes went down, and some of the biggest companies in America failed. This problem, called a recession, still exists today. We need to ask: how did this happen, and how can we stop it?\n\nThe economic problem was caused by bad decisions made by politicians. They pushed banks and companies to make bad loans to people who could not pay them back. These loans were given to people who did not have enough money to pay. The problem was made worse because the country's financial system was not strong enough. Two big companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, helped to sell these bad loans to other people. When the people who borrowed the money could not pay, the banks lost money and gave it to the people who bought the bad loans.\n\nThis problem started in the 1990s. The president at that time, Bill Clinton, wanted to stay in office for another term. To do this, he made it easier for people to get loans to buy homes. This made the housing market grow, but it also made it more likely for people to borrow too much money and not be able to pay it back. \n\nA reporter from the New York Times wrote in 1999: \"Fannie Mae was in trouble because it was giving loans to people who could not pay them back.\" He said that if there was a bad economy, the government might have to help Fannie Mae. This is exactly what happened.\n\nMany factors made the economy get worse. New kinds of loans and investments were created, which made it harder for people to understand what they were doing. These new loans and investments made many people put all their money in the housing market. When the housing market crashed, the people who had invested in these loans lost a lot of money.\n\nThe problem was very big. The top five banks in the United States had $4.1 trillion dollars of bad loans in 2007. This is a huge amount of money, about 30% of the country's total wealth. In the end, some of these banks were sold or forced to change how they worked. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had $5 trillion dollars of bad loans and were put under government control in 2008.",
            "Exposition is a part of a story where writers show more information about the characters, setting, or plot. But too much exposition can be boring and make readers lose interest.\n\nYou may already know the writing tip \"Show, don't tell.\" But sometimes writers still write too much information. Exposition is when a writer tells the audience what happened. It can happen in many ways, like in a movie when one character tells another a lot of information.\n\nFor example, you might be reading a story and learn that a main character met someone she loved, got married, and then her husband was killed. But instead of just saying that, the writer should show how the character felt and what she learned from her husband. This makes readers more connected to the character and care about what happens to her.\n\nIn this example, the writer might show how the husband loved his wife by what he said and did. The writer could also show how the wife felt about her husband and how he changed her life. This would make readers feel sad when he dies and more connected to the wife.\n\nAs a writer, it's your job to add meat to the story. Don't rush past important parts. If you introduce a new character, give them some history. But don't tell too much at once. For example, you might say a character used to be in the Air Force and now works at a gas station. That's a good start. You could also say he likes to fish and has big dreams. But leave some things to the reader's imagination.",
            "I watched two news programs from Columbus, Ohio. The first was a live NBC 4 newscast on August 13, 2011. The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who hurt his wife very badly. He was named Shad Hostettler. They showed his picture. He looked very bad. The news program gave this story only two minutes because it was still developing. They said he had hurt his wife many times and was arrested.\n\nThe next story was about a man named Travis Buyers, 18, who was shot in the Sharon Woods area. He was very badly hurt. The police were investigating. They had not found the person who hurt him. This story was short. I think it was short because the man who was hurt was black. I have noticed before that when a black person is a victim of a crime, they do not get much attention in the news. If a white person is a victim, the news makes a big deal about it.\n\nThe next story was about a helicopter that was hit by a bullet. The police think it happened in a certain area. They said it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. The police want people to help find the person who shot the helicopter. They are offering a five-thousand-dollar reward.\n\nThe next story was about rain and thunderstorms on Saturday. They said it would be hot all weekend.\n\nThey also told a story about a robbery at a store in Columbus. The man who robbed the store was wearing a black hoodie and was black. They said he was tall and weighed a lot.\n\nAnother story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez. He was a big time drug dealer in Texas. He was sent to prison for 300 months for selling a lot of marijuana to Ohio from Texas. They also said he was Hispanic. I do not think this was important to the story.",
            "There is a special connection between brothers. This connection is strong and never breaks. Many feelings are inside this connection. They include love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers understand each other very well. They can see themselves in each other. When a brother is in trouble, the true nature of their connection is clear. It can be good or bad. When these feelings are clear, they come with a big cost. Understanding the feelings of this brotherly connection means dealing with the bad things that happen. When a brother looks at another brother, he sees himself. This helps him see what he is really like, not what others think. The brother's actions and the problems they cause show what kind of person he is. In the story \"The Scarlet Ibis\", two brothers explore this brotherly connection and the strong feelings that come with it. They go on a difficult journey through a beautiful place. In the end, one brother survives. The story shows this theme through how the main character, the older brother, acts towards his little brother, Doodle. The story also shows the narrator's point of view, which helps us understand how the main character feels about the world and his brother. These feelings affect the main character's actions.\n\nThe main character's actions are about one feeling: pride. From the beginning, the main character is unhappy with his little brother, Doodle. Doodle is sick and cannot do the things the main character wants to do. The main character wants a brother to play with and learn from. He wants someone to be with him in the swamp and in the top of a big tree. But Doodle is too weak. He cannot do these things. The main character is very disappointed. He even thinks about hurting Doodle. But when Doodle smiles, the main character feels happy. This shows that the main character really loves his brother.",
            "The brain is a very complicated organ in the human body that helps us think and understand the world. As time went on, people used different comparisons to explain how the brain works. At first, it was like a piece of wax for writing, then a piece of paper, then a book, and now it is compared to a computer. But these comparisons are not perfect and can lead to misunderstandings.\n\nThe brain gets information from our senses. Our senses turn things like touch, heat, and light into electrical signals. These signals are changed many times in the brain as it tries to understand what they mean. For example, when you look at a picture of a black box on a white background, the brain puts together small pieces of information like color and shape to make sense of it. It then uses this information to quickly recognize the object.\n\nThe brain has a filter that decides what is important and what we should pay attention to. For example, when you look at the ground, your brain sees many blades of grass, but you do not notice them. But if someone says your name, you quickly hear it.\n\nThe brain processes information in many steps. It also uses a special attention filter to decide what information is important and what is not. There are different kinds of memory, including short-term and long-term memory. First, the brain takes in information and codes it in a way that makes sense. Then, it stores the information. There are different ways to store different kinds of information. For example, if you hear a word, your brain stores it in a way that involves how it sounds.\n\nThere are many ideas about how the brain stores and organizes knowledge. Some ideas come from how people remember things, others from computers, and others from the study of the brain itself. One idea is that the brain has a network of connections between concepts, like \"chair\" and \"table.\" These connections help us understand how things are related to each other.",
            "Aldous Huxley writes about a future world where people value community over individual freedom. This world is like a science fiction nightmare. The people in this world do not think for themselves. They are taught to be happy and not to question the system. They are controlled by a leader who calls himself the \"World Controller.\" \n\nHuxley is writing about the dangers of a system where people do not have freedom. He is saying that this system is like communism in a way. Communism is an economic system where the government controls everything. People do not have choices; they are told what to do. In Huxley's story, people are conditioned to be happy, but they are not truly happy. They are like robots. \n\nThe people in this world are divided into classes. The upper classes are smart and powerful. They have everything they need. The lower classes are not as smart and have less power. They are like machines, doing what they are told. They do not question the system.\n\nHuxley is saying that this system is bad. People should be free to make their own choices. They should be able to love and think for themselves. But in this world, love and true feelings are not allowed. People only care about how things look. They do not care about what is inside.\n\nThe people in this world are like puppets on strings. They are controlled by the system. They do not have their own thoughts or feelings. They are like machines. This is what Huxley is saying is wrong with the world. He is saying that people should be free and not controlled by the system.\n\nHuxley is using a way of thinking called Marxism. Marxism is a way of understanding how the world works. It says that the rich people control the poor people. In Huxley's story, the upper classes control the lower classes. The lower classes do what they are told, and they are happy about it. But Huxley is saying that this is not true happiness. This is a false happiness. The people in this world are not truly happy. They are just pretending to be happy.\n\nHuxley is warning us about the dangers of a system where people are controlled. He is saying that we should be free to make our own choices. We should be able to love and think for ourselves. We should not be like puppets on strings, controlled by the system.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for about two and a half years. Getting around campus can be hard. My freshman year, I lived in a dorm on the east side of campus, far from other buildings. Walking to classes in buildings like Willard, near the center of campus, took up to 25 minutes. The weather was often bad, making it even harder. I learned that not long ago, there was a lot of empty land between the dorms and other buildings. Now, this space has buildings, sports fields, and apartments. As the campus grows, it gets harder to move around. The best solution is a bicycle. But it is not enough to just have a bike. Students must ride them, and the campus must be designed for bicyclists.\n\nI talked to a friend who rides a bike again after a few years. He said, \"Bikes are great. For a while, it wasn't cool, but now it's the best way to get around.\" Bicycling is good for your body and very efficient. You can go 30 miles or more with a bowl of oatmeal and some exercise. I live off campus, near the center of campus. I bought a bike this year, and it was a good decision. Now, I can get to my class in Thomas building in 5 minutes if I ride fast. But the road to Thomas building is not always easy to ride on. I also like the idea of walking, but I am very busy. If I didn't have a bike, I would have to walk. Walking to Thomas building would take 30-40 minutes. That is over two and a half hours every week. I don't have that much time."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",

The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today.

Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

Research has shown that neurons in the brain called orexin help us sleep and wake up. A study on mice found that a receptor in the brain called GABAB helps us sleep. If this receptor is not working well, it can cause problems sleeping. The study found that a medicine called baclofen can help people sleep by activating the GABAB receptor.\n\nThe Sociocultural model of sleep disorders looks at how our environment affects our sleep. If the GABAB receptor is inherited, it can affect our sleep. This means that people may be more likely to have insomnia if their parents had it. This can have a big impact on our lives, especially when we have to do repetitive tasks and need to focus.",
            "This paper talks about Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, we will explain what CAPD is. Then, we will talk about how to diagnose the disorder. Finally, we will discuss how a teacher can help a student with CAPD in a regular classroom.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) is a problem with how the brain uses sound. It is not a hearing problem. People with CAPD can hear sounds, but their brain has trouble understanding them. The brain has trouble separating sounds from background noise and understanding what people are saying.\n\nThe idea of CAPD was first talked about in the 1950s. Researchers were studying children with communication problems. They started giving tests to these children in 1954. In 1961, a researcher named Kimura created a test to understand how the brain works when we hear two sounds at the same time.\n\nCAPD can cause several problems. A person with CAPD may have trouble finding the source of a sound. They may also have trouble hearing two or more sounds at the same time. It is hard for them to understand patterns in sounds. They may not be able to hear the difference in speech, like understanding sarcasm. Sometimes, one sound can cover up another sound. A person with CAPD may not be able to use sound clues to make sense of things. They may also have trouble understanding the order of sounds.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a doctor or specialist will watch how a person listens and reacts to sounds. They may also give tests to see how well the person can understand sounds. These tests may include questionnaires, watching how the person behaves, and measuring how well they can hear sounds in different situations. There is no one test that works for everyone, and we do not know what causes CAPD.\n\nA teacher in a regular classroom can help a student with CAPD in several ways. First, they can give the student extra help understanding instructions. They can also give the student time to ask questions. Teachers can also try to reduce background noise in the classroom. This can help the student with CAPD focus on what the teacher is saying. Finally, teachers can work with the student to develop strategies to help them understand and use sound clues.",
            "The play Twelfth Night says that pretending to be someone you are not can be useful for a short time, but in the end, you must be honest. If not, you could lose yourself forever. A big problem is that when you stop pretending, you may feel alone. This is because others may not understand why you tricked them. They may be angry with you. \n\nThe play questions why people pretend to be someone else. In the play, the character Viola pretends to be a man to be safe from harm. She is good at pretending, and people believe her. But she also suffers. She cannot be with the women she knows, and she makes a man, Sebastian, fall in love with her. She also has feelings for the man Orsino, but she cannot tell him. \n\nThe play shows how pretending can help people see their true feelings. For example, the woman Olivia loves Viola, who is pretending to be a man. But then she loves the real man Sebastian, who looks like Viola. This makes some people think that Olivia secretly loves women. But this may not be true. Olivia is probably just making fun of people who judge others based on how they look. \n\nThe play says that we must be honest. We must be ourselves. Trying to be someone else can cause problems and hurt others. It is better to be true and be understood and loved for who you are.",
            "The German colonial rule was very bad. It was especially bad for the Ovaherero and Nama people in German South West Africa. The German colonial rule was not the same in all the colonies. It was different in policy and in how it was run. Education in the colonies was also different. When the British took over German East Africa in 1919, they found many Africans who could read and write. The German government in other colonies also worked to educate Africans.\n\nBut the situation in South West Africa was very different. The German government did not do much to educate the local people. Instead, missionary groups helped the local people. The government did help Europeans in the colony get an education. The government built schools for them and helped the missionary schools. The German government's decision had a big effect on South West Africa. Many years later, the country still had a lot of problems because of this.\n\nOther German colonies had many educated and literate Africans. But in South West Africa, most people were not educated. They did not know how to read or write. Many things caused these problems in South West Africa. This paper wants to look at these things and learn more about the attitudes of the people in charge and the settlers.\n\nThere is a lot of writing about education in the German colonies. Most of these writings were in German and were written a long time ago. They described the education systems in the colonies. Later writings compared the education systems in different colonies. They looked at how the education systems were similar and different. One important study was done by Cohen. He compared education in South West Africa and East Africa. He said that the reason for the differences was because of the number of European settlers in South West Africa.\n\nSouth West Africa had a good climate, but it had a lot of desert. The number of Europeans living there was not very big. In 1913, only about 15,000 Europeans lived in South West Africa. Many more Europeans lived in other German colonies. For example, only 5,336 Europeans lived in East Africa.",
            "The kinds of music we call \"pop music\" have changed a lot over the last 100 years. Now we have many kinds of pop music. It is hard to make a complete list of all the kinds. Even the main kinds of pop music - like rock, country, jazz, and folk - have many smaller kinds within them.\n\nOne of the most interesting kinds of music is called Heavy Metal rock. It has a lot of emotions in it, mostly sad and dark feelings. But even though it is dark, people have made many different kinds of Heavy Metal music. They did this because it is very flexible and can be used in many ways.\n\nNow, there are many different kinds of Heavy Metal music. They have taken ideas from other kinds of music and made them their own. But Heavy Metal music started from somewhere. To understand the music we hear today, we need to know what Heavy Metal music is and why it is called a \"movement\" rather than just a kind of music.\n\nHeavy Metal music is often about darkness. It is music that is loud and strong. People who play Heavy Metal music are very good at playing their instruments. The music is different from other kinds of music because it is not simple. It has a lot of complicated parts.\n\nHeavy Metal music also came from people who used drugs to help them create their music. In the 1970s, many people used drugs, and this led to some strange and new kinds of music. The music was like a reflection of the users' feelings, which were often sad and dark. Later, other people made music that was influenced by the dark feelings of the past. They took some of the ideas from the past and used them to make new music.\n\nSome songs, like \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles, show the dark side of music. This song is considered one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to another song by the Rolling Stones, which was also very loud and dark. The Beatles wanted to show that they could make music as loud and dark as the Stones.",
            "Henri Rousseau was a French artist. He lived from 1844 to 1910. Before the Surrealist artists made famous dreamlike paintings, Rousseau worked on his own dream-inspired art. His famous painting, The Dream, shows a woman looking at the wonders of a new place in her dream. But it also shows Rousseau's own hopes and dreams as an artist.\n\nRousseau wanted people to like and accept his art. He wanted to be famous and well-known. But he faced a big problem. He could either paint like other famous artists and follow the rules, or he could be different and do his own thing. This was a problem he had all his life.\n\nTo understand The Dream, you need to know about Rousseau's life. He was born in a town in northwest France. His father was a hardware dealer. Rousseau did not go to art school. He grew up and worked for the government until he was 40. After that, he started painting to make himself happy. He wanted to escape his sad life after his first wife died. He had eight baby children who also died. He had one daughter left, Julia.\n\nRousseau's art was different from other artists. He painted simple things and was a bit like a folk artist. He wanted to be accepted by the art world. But he had to compete with other famous artists like Matisse. Matisse was a talented artist who did not want to paint in a boring way. Rousseau, on the other hand, wanted to paint in a way that would make him famous.\n\nRousseau finally got recognition when he was older. But it was not until Matisse was already famous. A writer named Jan Gordon said that Rousseau's goal was to paint in a way that was safe and accepted by everyone. He wanted to be part of the French art group.",
            "Many great thinkers believe that ethics and art are connected. They think that truth and beauty are closely related. I agree with this idea. A poet named John Keats said, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty.\" He said this in a poem about a special cup. He means that beauty and truth are the same thing. We learn many things in life from education and experience. But we like or dislike art and morals without being taught. Both ethics and aesthetics try to explain, not tell us what to do. We try to understand why a piece of art is beautiful or why an action is good, rather than following rules. \n\nWe can't fully explain why something is good or beautiful. Critics of art or morals can't say exactly what makes something good. They might talk about things like how an artist uses color or background. But these things don't explain why something is good. When people talk about their favorite art or literature, they often say, \"There's something about it.\" Then they give more details. I think that art and morals can't be explained completely. We can't say everything about why something is good or beautiful. A writer, Flannery O'Connor, said, \"You tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" We tell a story to say something that can't be said in another way. I think ethics is the same. A philosopher, Wittgenstein, said, \"Ethics can't be explained. Ethics is beyond words.\" I think that this \"something\" is what makes art and morality so powerful. It's this \"something\" that connects them.\n\nI believe that ethics and art are closely related because they affect us deeply. We can't fully understand them, but we can feel them. This is especially true for literature. Literature is special because it deals with values. We learn values from literature, and that's why it's so important.",
            "Germany is a strong country today. It is united with its own culture. This culture is from many different groups that lived in the area near the Alps in München to the city of Kiel on the Baltic Sea. You can feel the same culture in Köln on the Rhine River and in the city of Dresden on the Elbe River. This is not surprising because Germany's culture comes from many different sources, including old tribes.\n\nThe land of the Germans is called Germania. We do not know for sure how the name came to be. Some people think it came from a Germanic tribe. Others believe it came from the word for a spear, which the Germans used in war. It may also have come from an old Irish word that means \"to shout.\" The Germans were known to be loud.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote about the Germans in his book. He said that the Germans were an ancient group of people and not a mix of different groups. They were living in Germany when the Romans arrived. The Romans came to Germany to trade and to take things from the land. They also sent soldiers to fight in Germany, but they mostly went back to Rome.\n\nThe Germanic tribes began to appear in the first century. They lived near the Roman Empire and traded their goods. Some Germans also served in the Roman army.",
            "I looked down and saw a picture in front of me. My mind was empty and not thinking about anything. I was watching the picture without feeling any strong emotions. My mind was working well, like a machine. I was looking at the picture, but I was not thinking about it in a special way.\n\nI once got an art book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" An artist friend told me to get it. The book teaches people how to draw. It says to use a square to help you look at a picture. This helps you see the picture in a simple way. It makes the picture smaller and easier to understand.\n\nI was looking at a bowl of fruit on a table. But I could not think of the square to put around the picture. I was too surprised. I stood and looked at the picture in wonder.\n\nSome artists, like Picasso, like blue. Others, like Monet, like green. The old masters in Italy liked many colors. If I wanted to be a good artist, this was my chance. This was the start of my picture, my story, called \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy hand moved to get a pencil. My hand moved to the toilet to draw. But my hand hit the toilet handle again and again. The brown package was stuck. I was very frustrated.\n\nI held a mop, and I was thinking about the brown package. It was a waste of food. Someone had left it in the toilet at the Rite Aid store. I wanted it to go away. I wanted to clean it up.\n\nI looked at the wall and took some toilet paper. My hand went into the toilet to try and get the package. I was careful, like a mom taking out a turkey for Thanksgiving.",
            "Many young drivers die in car accidents.  Several things combine to cause this problem.  The National Institutes of Health say one reason is that young brains are not ready for the dangers of driving.  Young people also do not have much experience driving.  This lack of experience causes more car accidents and more severe injuries.  Teens do worse when they drive with their friends.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center studied this.  They found a connection between the age of the passenger and the number of car accidents.\n\nCalifornia and other states try to make driving safer for young people.  They do this by giving temporary licenses that limit the hours young people can drive and do not allow other young passengers.\n\nBut these temporary licenses are not enough.  The real problem is that young people are not good at handling the risks and responsibilities of driving.  A psychologist named Marvin Zuckerman says 18 years old is too young for a regular driver's license.  He says young people under 19 or 20 often want to take risks because it is exciting.  This means we should delay giving driver's licenses to young teens.  If we do not, there will be more car accidents and the number of deaths will be very high.  By 2010, many new teen drivers will be on the road.\n\nWe can make a law to fix this problem.  Schools can teach driver's education classes.  But no one under 18 can drive a car.  A temporary permit can still be given before a full driver's license.  Young people must also get a certain number of hours of practice with a licensed driver.  The number of hours can be the same as the number of hours most states require.  A national law would be a good way to keep young people safe across the country.\n\nThis idea is not new.  But it can help save lives.",
            "The Library of Congress has a collection of early Edison films. I looked through them. I found 15 trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films use creative editing to create illusions. I studied these films to learn about their style and growth. Most trick films from this time are set in a fixed frame. The camera does not move to follow people or objects. The style comes from theater and vaudeville shows.\n\nIn some films, actors move side to side. They do not walk towards or away from the camera. An example is the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right and move back and forth.\n\nThe camera does not follow the actors when they leave the frame. Trick films usually show the whole scene at one time. They do not use close-up shots like we see in modern movies. This style comes from theater and vaudeville. The performers stay in the middle of the stage and do not move towards the camera.\n\nMost early trick films show one scene at a time. This means they are usually short, only a minute or less. The films show simple tricks, like magic and disappearing acts. But sometimes, one scene is made up of many small parts. A good example is The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895). If you look closely, you can see where the camera starts to show Mary's head being cut off.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a strong supporter of Republican ideas.  He was a farmer, but he also worked in politics.  These two things made him known for his strong opinions about personal freedom and government.  He believed that farming was the best job.  This idea influenced his thoughts about government.  He wanted to protect and help this kind of job.\n\nTaylor thought the United States had a great chance to create a perfect system of government.  There was no old way of doing things to get in the way.  He believed in the basic rights of people.  These rights are like a team.  If one right is not fair, all the others are not good either.  He said the government should not control these rights.\n\nTaylor said that some people with power and evil ideas would take advantage of others in nature.  But in a society, this should not happen.  To make a good society, the government must understand both good and bad in people.  Taylor thought government is like people.  It can be good or bad, depending on how it is run.\n\nTaylor believed that a good government protects property, helps farming, and does not support capitalism.  He thought a good government would be fair, no matter who is in charge.  He believed that self-interest is a bad thing when it hurts others.  But it is not always bad.  A good government can keep this self-interest from making problems.\n\nTaylor wanted the government to be limited.  He did not want the government to have more power than the Constitution said it could have.  He thought a big government would be expensive and could be cruel.  But he also thought a simple, strict reading of the Constitution could be bad.  Without understanding the ideas of the people who wrote it, this way of looking at the Constitution could be unfair.  Taylor thought the Declaration of Independence was more important than the Constitution.  It said that the United States is a group of states, not one country.",
            "We look at Figure 17. There was a big drop in the number of people who used the commuter log in the third month of the project. This was not good news. It is hard to say why this happened. We know that winter came to the campus in New England. Fewer people ride bikes or walk during the winter. This might be one reason for the drop. Students and teachers were busy in December. They were finishing school and getting grades. They may have forgotten to fill out the log. December is also the start of the holiday time. Many students and teachers do not need to come to campus for a month. Classes start again in late January. This might also be a reason for the low number of logs. But we still do not know why there were few logs in February. People might get excited about a new project at the beginning. Then, their interest might decrease. We tried to make the project more interesting in March with the Carpool Challenge Week. We got more logs for that month. This shows that we need to find a way to keep people interested in the project. We also need to consider the fact that people like to drive cars. This is a part of our culture. We need to give people good reasons to use other ways of commuting. We gave prizes like gift cards to local stores. We gave out these prizes throughout the project. It would have been interesting to see if bigger prizes would have made more people participate. For example, if we had given away a bike or a new car, we might have gotten more people to use the commuter log. We did not change the prizes during the project. If we had said that we would give better prizes in the future, people might have been more interested.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a type of investment. It follows an index, a product, or a group of things like an index fund. But it is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange. You get the benefits of many investments and the ability to own a single stock. You can sell some, buy more, and buy as little as one share at a time. ETFs are also less expensive than mutual funds. But you must pay a fee for trading them. There are many different types of ETFs available.\n\nWe are looking at the ETF IHF and its top 10 holdings that make up 63.58% of its assets. We want to know if owning this one ETF is the same as owning a group of its top 10 stocks. We also want to know if there are better ways to invest in these same stocks.\n\nTo make it easier, we will only look at the top 10 holdings. Below, you can see the top 10 stocks and the percentage of the ETF's assets they make up.\n\nWe can use a chart to see how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF. We can use the percentages to calculate the returns and risk of a portfolio made up only of these 10 stocks. The chart shows the results.\n\nThe chart shows that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could get a 6.11% higher return than the ETF. It also shows that its risk is 0.12 lower. This means that owning just the top 10 holdings could be a good choice. But we need to be sure that the differences are real. To do this, we need to check the standard deviation of each stock. This will tell us if the differences are important or not.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe wrote a poem called \"Dream-Land\". This is one of his good poems. He used a word \"Thulé\" in his poem. Poe said he got this word from the writer Virgil. Virgil used it to describe an island north of Britain. But Poe learned from another writer, Gothe. \n\nGothe was a famous German writer. Poe liked his work. Gothe wrote a poem called \"Faust\". It was published in two parts. The second part came out after Gothe died in 1832. There is a short poem in \"Faust\" called \"The King of Thulé\". It is about a king who loses his wife. He drinks a lot and cries about his dead wife. He then decides to die. He gives away all his things, except a special cup. He goes to a cliff, throws the cup into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. Poe's poem \"Dream-Land\" is similar to \"The King of Thulé\". Maybe this is because Poe had lost someone and drank a lot like the king. \n\nPoe used the word Thule in two of his poems. He said \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\". He used it twice in \"Dream-Land\", at the beginning and the end. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be read together. In \"Dream-Land\", the speaker talks about a dark and lonely place called Thule. He sees dead friends and a world without color. This is like what happens in \"The King of Thulé\". The king is lonely because his wife died. He lost his will to rule or live. \n\nGothe was a well-known writer. Poe would have read his work. Poe liked Tennyson, and Tennyson liked Gothe. Poe would have been interested in Gothe's work because of this connection.",
            "A customer in California was hurt when she slipped and fell on applesauce in a store. The store manager, Martin, was informed about the spill twice, but he did not clean it. He was eating dinner at the time. Can this customer get extra money from the store for being hurt? The answer is yes. She can argue that the store manager should have known that not cleaning the spill would cause harm. Many people had slipped and fallen in the store before. \n\nTo get extra money, the customer must show that the store manager acted on purpose and knew that his action would hurt someone. A court will not quickly reject her claim. The customer can say that the store manager should have cleaned the spill, even if it took some time. He should have known that not cleaning it would be a problem.\n\nThe store manager said he was busy eating dinner. But, he had been told about the spill twice. He ignored the problem. The customer slipped and fell 30 minutes later. This is not a good excuse. Many people had slipped and fallen in the store before, and the manager should have taken action.\n\nCalifornia law says a customer can get extra money if the store manager acted with malice. Malice means the manager wanted to hurt someone or showed a bad disregard for the customer's safety. In this case, the customer can argue that the manager did not take the spill seriously and put many people in danger. \n\nThe law in California says a court must consider if the store manager's actions were wrong and intended to cause harm. The customer can argue that the manager was aware that not cleaning the spill would cause harm and did not care. This is enough to make a claim for extra money.\n\nIn this case, six people slipped and fell in the store in one year. The manager did not take action to fix the problem. This is a good reason to argue that the manager acted with malice. He showed a bad disregard for the customers' safety.\n\nIn summary, the customer has a good chance to get extra money from the store for being hurt. She can argue that the store manager acted with malice and ignored the spill. This was a bad decision that put many people in danger.",
            "Four years ago, I took a class about Islam at CBC. A big question in the class was if Islam is a hostile religion. I think this question is still important today. Looking back at what happened since 9/11, I see that the media's view of Islam changed a great deal. From being very critical, it became more accepting. It's hard to believe that in 2001, a president with a Muslim background like Barack Obama could have run for office.\n\nI'm interested in the story of the Prophet Muhammad. What I learned about him seems different from his personality. I thought he forced people to become Muslims. He would win battles and then make the defeated tribes join his religion. But his story says he was a humble and kind man. He didn't try to prove himself, but lived a simple life with miracles. This makes me think the writers wanted people to see him as a special person, but it takes away from the legend of Jesus.\n\nThere are many stories in the biography that seem like they are trying to show how people believed in Muhammad on their own. But the problem is that many of these stories come from people who heard from others. This makes the stories seem less real. I don't like this because it makes it seem like they are trying to hide the truth.\n\nI have a big problem with the way the biography presents Muhammad. It says he was a kind and wise man, but history shows that he was not. I wonder if Muslims know the real story of how he became powerful.",
            "The ideas of Jesus were not kept after he died. The Christian way of thinking changed quickly. If we look at the past, we see that Christianity moved away from its roots. Today, we see a growing understanding and a new way of thinking. Many traditional people will not change. They will not accept new ideas. But they are not the majority. More and more people will be interested in the real meaning of Christianity. In the future, many people will want to know what Jesus truly said. They will want to separate the ideas added to Christianity over time from the true meaning of the religion. It may take time, but this will happen. Christianity will go back to its original form. A movement will start to remove extra ideas. It will be like going back in time. Only the ideas of Jesus will be left. When this happens in the United States and Europe, many people will follow Jesus' ideas as if they lived in his time. The church will remain strong to guide people. But the church will be more simple. There will be less difference between different groups. People will be more alike in what they believe. This is not the first time this has happened. The Roman Empire persecuted Christians, but later became Christian. Our country has changed from slave to leader. The same thing will happen in the Christian church. People will go back to the source. They will not care about different groups and ideas. To make this happen, people will start to understand Jesus' words as examples, not as real things. If we look far back in time, we only see Judaism. This is the base of the Christian religion. The idea of one god, the power of the Bible, and the authority of Jewish leaders were all important parts of Judaism before the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish people were not all the same. They had different groups like Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and many common people.",
            "The Jungle shows that people are naturally selfish and only think about themselves. They want to make their lives better, but they do not care about others. The book shows this in many ways. One example is the owners and managers of big factories. They only want to make their companies bigger and better. They do not care about anything that gets in their way or gets hurt. They do not care about the air pollution or the dirty water from the factory animals. \n\nThe owners and managers also do not care about their workers. They pay them very little and make them work long hours. They can fire workers without warning and without giving them any help finding a new job. During that time, there were no laws to protect workers. This meant the owners and managers could do what they wanted. The workers lived and worked in bad conditions. They did not have any help or information about their rights. Some workers formed unions, but they often made money from the poor workers. The workers were treated very badly and had no way to escape the system.\n\nThe Jungle says that people in this situation are like slaves. They are poor and do not have many opportunities. They depend on the owners and managers for their lives. That means they have to do what they are told, even if it is bad for them. The book says that in this situation, bad behavior is common and expected.",
            "F. Scott Fitzgerald uses different methods to make readers feel a certain way about important things. He\nuses many of these methods in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs words together\nto make a new meaning. He uses this to give a special feeling around a subject. Fitzgerald also uses\nsymbols and gives them meaning. Then he uses the same symbol for the same feeling. He does this with\nmany colors, like gold, green, white, gray, red, and pink.\n\nFitzgerald uses white and gray to show sameness. White means nice and high class, but gray means old\nand faded. He starts to show this in the beginning of the novel. He uses these colors many times. Daisy\nand Jordan wear white all the time. Nick wears white clothes to Gatsby's party. Tom wears a white shirt\nwhen he meets Myrtle. Fitzgerald uses these colors on many ordinary things, like a white chasm in New\nYork, gray cars, and gray land.\n\nAfter he shows the meaning of white and gray, he uses them to show that something is not important.\nHe starts with Daisy. He does not use these colors for a long time, and then he describes Daisy as wearing\nwhite. This shows that Daisy is not a special character, but just someone Gatsby wants.\n\nFitzgerald uses this technique again to show that Daisy is not special. For example, he describes her fur\ncollar as gray and her dress as white. He wants readers to see Daisy as just another person, not as a\nspecial person.",

This is because it does not use chemicals in the soil and water. But organic farming can be more expensive than farming with chemicals. It needs more work and management to stop pests and weeds and make the soil healthy without chemicals. Organic farms also have higher losses than big farms that use chemicals. \n\nThe land chosen for this project is near the town of Potrero in San Diego County. It is 160 acres of land with chaparral, grass, and oak trees. The area is near the Cleveland National Forest. Many animals live there. Some are endangered and need our help. The area was once home to Native Americans and later to cattle ranchers and people who sold wood.\n\nI chose this land from a website and looked at government programs that can help small farmers. I found a real farm in the area that grows organic food. This farm is a model for what a farmer in the area might do to make a living and help the environment.",
            "Culture is very important in negotiations. It is not easy to define culture. It is not the same everywhere. Culture is not just one thing. We should not say that all people from a certain country are the same. For example, we should not say, \"All Russians are stubborn\" or \"All Japanese are very polite.\" It is better to understand the culture of a country and how it affects a negotiation.\n\nWhen we go to a new country, we see their culture in a way that makes sense to us. We make comparisons with our own culture. To understand a foreign culture, we can learn about its history or its problems. We should not judge or try to change their culture. We should accept it and work with it. This is especially true when we are in a weaker position in a negotiation.\n\nCulture is not just about countries. Companies also have their own cultures. A company's culture can be very different from another company's culture. Some companies work very hard, while others have a more relaxed schedule. We can see a company's culture in the way its employees dress, communicate, and work. Some companies want their employees to help others, but others do not.\n\nValues are very important to understand. They explain why people behave in certain ways. If people in a culture value saving face or being kind to each other, they will not do things that might hurt others. If people value hard work, they will try to get a good deal in a negotiation. We should think about these values before we start a negotiation. But we should also try to understand our opponent on a personal level to be successful in a negotiation.",
            "The Bible says, \"The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This idea is from Psalm 14. A Christian philosopher named St. Anselm used this idea in his argument about God's existence. We will also discuss Thomas Aquinas, who also believed in God. Both of their ideas are about the same God in the Bible. To compare their ideas, let's assume that they are both right.\n\nSt. Anselm's idea is that God exists in our minds. He says we can know God exists because we can think about God. This idea is based on faith. Faith is believing in something without proof.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas has a different idea. He says we can know God exists by using our reason and looking at the world around us. We do not need faith. He gives five reasons for God's existence. These reasons are change, cause, chance, perfection, and order. He says these reasons show that we need God. For example, imagine you have a puzzle with most of the pieces. If you know the whole picture, you can know what the missing piece is like.\n\nIn this way, St. Aquinas says we can know God exists using our minds and what we see in the world.",
            "Buddha was born in the fifth or sixth century BCE. He was a prince. Later in life, he gave up his position in the world and became a wise man. This man's teachings led to the creation of Buddhism. One part of Buddhism is called Theravada Buddhism. This religion is about 2,500 years old. It is different from what it was when Buddha was alive. You can see these changes in Theravada countries like Sri Lanka.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, a yearly ceremony is held. It is called the water-cutting ceremony. Monks and ordinary people take part in this ceremony. But Buddha never taught about a ceremony like this. These changes are not only in small things. They are in the main ideas of the religion too.\n\nThe Theravada Buddhist community has changed its ideas over time. This happened both from inside and outside the community. Inside the community, changes came from people who are Buddhist. Outside the community, changes came from people who are not Buddhist. Changes that are good for the community are called benign. Changes that are bad for the community are called hostile.\n\nTo understand this better, we need to know some key ideas. \n\nInternal means something that comes from inside the Buddhist community. External means something that comes from outside the community. Hostile means something that hurts the community. Benign means something that does not hurt the community, even if it has a bad effect.\n\nNow, let's look at the main ideas of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists believe in three important things: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is a collection of Buddhist teachings. It includes three groups of books: the Sutta Pitaka, the Vinaya Pitaka, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka.\n\nThe Sutta Pitaka has teachings that are like conversations. The Vinaya Pitaka has rules for Buddhist monks and nuns. The Abhidhamma Pitaka has ideas about the universe. Some of these ideas are that everything is not permanent, that life is hard, and that people have no soul.\n\nTo end the cycle of death and rebirth, people must understand these ideas. They must also understand that desire, hatred, and confusion are the causes of suffering. To stop suffering, people must give up these things. The Vinaya Pitaka has rules for lay Buddhists. These rules say do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not be lazy, and do not take drugs. Monks have more rules to follow.\n\nThe most important idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. The first truth is that life is suffering. The second truth is that attachment causes suffering. The third truth is that suffering can be ended.",
            "The United States and Mexico are two countries with a long history of rivalry. This rivalry lasted 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. The two countries had many fights. The biggest fight was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848. The United States won this war and got Texas and the American Southwest. \n\nThe rivalry began because of disagreements about religion, culture, and tradition. The two countries had different ideas about these things. They also had big problems with material goods. The United States and Mexico are not the only countries that have a big rivalry with a neighbor. Many countries that share a border have problems like this.\n\nDavid M. Pletcher says, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba do we find long-lasting American diplomatic problems.\" Both Mexico and Cuba are close to the United States. They have been rivals to the United States for a long time. Other countries in Latin America have good relations with the United States.\n\nReligion was a big problem between the two countries. The United States and Mexico had different ideas about what is right. This has been a problem for many countries throughout history. Sally Frahm says, \"If Americans were against fascism and communism in the twentieth century, they were against Catholicism and monarchy in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.\" The United States and Mexico had a rivalry based on their different ideas about religion. This was because of the distrust between the English and Spanish.\n\nThe United States and Mexico had many problems. They had 17 fights between 1836 and 1893. Most of these fights were about territory and border problems. Outlaws and bandits from the United States had problems on the border. This was a big problem until both countries used their military to control the border.\n\nThe rivalry between the United States and Mexico ended as Mexico became dependent on the United States. The United States changed its goals from expanding its territory to helping Mexico economically. This change happened in the later part of the 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I got sick. I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen nursing because I wanted a safe and secure job. Many people told me that nursing was a good job because people will always get sick. \n\nBut I had bigger dreams. I wanted to be a scientist or a journalist. However, I chose nursing. I am now 61 years old and unable to work. I get money from Social Security, but I have no savings. Every day is a struggle.\n\nI have been lucky because my family and some friends have helped me. But when something bad happens, you feel very weak. \n\nMy point is that life is full of emergencies. We cannot be sure of the future. We need to be prepared, but some problems are too big for one person to solve alone.\n\nI agree that we should not rely too much on big government. But I think we should try to trust each other more. We should help each other and ask for help when we need it. \n\nSome people say that America was built on rugged individualism. But it was really about helping each other and sharing what we have. The people who traveled across the country in wagons did not do it alone. They worked together.\n\nSo, be prepared. I have a disaster kit and first aid supplies. I also have food and water for a long time. If you have a big piece of land, you can grow your own food and store it for later. This is a good idea. But it is also important to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do living things change over time? Are there rules that guide the way they change? Many scientists have tried to understand this, but it is still a hard problem. Recently, some scientists have used math to study how animals grow and change. They looked at the shells of a certain type of animal called Prunum. The scientists want to know how these animals change over time and how their shells develop. They used special pictures of the shells to create math models. These models can help them understand how the animals' shells grow and change. The scientists also did experiments to learn more about the animals and their shells.\n\nA shell is like a tube that moves through space over time. It turns around in a circle, like a spiral. This spiral is divided into parts called whorls. Each whorl is like a ring that grows as the animal gets older. The whorls turn around a middle line that runs through the shell. This line is called the columella. The speed at which the whorls grow can be different, and a line separates each whorl. This line is called a suture. The last whorl of the shell is the biggest one. The spire is all the whorls except the last one. The tip of the spire is called the apex, and the other end is called the base. The animal comes out of its shell through a hole called the aperture.\n\nWe can look at shells in different ways. We can look at the top, the bottom, the front, or the back. Most of the time, we look at the front of the shell. When we look at the shell from the front, the aperture is open, and the apex is pointing up.\n\nTo measure the whorls, we look at the shell from the top and find where the first line is. Then we draw a line to divide the shell. We count the whorls from this line, and we can estimate the number of whorls to one-quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell is like a path that the animal follows as it grows. We can trace this path by looking at the center of each whorl and the size of the aperture. We can draw this path and use math to understand how the animal's shell grows. Once we have a math formula, we can change the parameters and see how the shell would grow differently.",
            "Indonesia's rate of death for newborn babies and infants has not improved much in the last ten years.  The country is doing well in some areas, like making clean water and sanitation available.  But the country is not making good progress in improving health for mothers and children.  Indonesia is not meeting its goals for improving health by 2015.  There are many reasons for this.  They will be explained below.\n\nIndonesia has made some progress in the number of births where a health worker is present.  Now, 72% of births have a worker like a nurse or a midwife.  But this does not mean all of these workers can give medical help if a mother or baby gets sick.  Many mothers and babies still die from bleeding during delivery.  This means the progress made in this area is not really very good.  Indonesia's health department also has a problem with treating children under five who have diarrhea.  Many children in the country do not get help from a health worker.  The country also does not have good records about taking care of mothers after they give birth.\n\nMany mothers do not have a cesarean operation when they need it.  In fact, only 4% of mothers have this operation.  The number of cesarean operations is higher in cities than in villages.  This shows that many people in villages do not have access to healthcare.  Many people can not afford healthcare because they have to pay out of their own money.  This is a big problem in Indonesia.\n\nTo improve health for mothers and babies, the government needs to decide what to do.  One idea is to help with specific programs for mothers and babies.  But this might not be the best idea.  Programs that focus on one area of health can be more effective and give faster results.  But they can also have some problems.  One problem is that they might take money and workers away from other areas of healthcare.  Another problem is that many programs can cause confusion and extra work.",
            "Victorian novels often look at small details. But two books, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, are different. They have mystery and strange things that are not common in other Victorian novels. This makes the characters more interesting and helps us understand their thoughts and feelings.\n\nOne time, Oliver Twist had many confusing ideas in his mind. He was walking with two men, Sikes and Crackit, who were arguing. Oliver thought he was still with them, but then he heard gunshots and people shouting. He felt pain and was taken away. This happened many times, and Oliver felt scared and in pain.\n\nOliver's dreams or strange times like these often tell us something about his feelings and problems. In one chapter, Oliver remembers being shot. He relives the moment like it's a dream. This shows how Oliver had no control over what happened to him. He was in a lot of pain and was taken away without knowing what was happening.\n\nOliver's life is hard. He has little control over things. He can't even try to take care of himself when his life is in danger. This makes us think that Oliver gives up easily. Maybe someone else is controlling him, making him feel this way.\n\nAnother time, Oliver says, \"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\" This means that time goes by quickly when you are in a bad situation. Oliver feels like he is trapped in a long night that is not ending.",
            "I worked in an after-school program two years ago. I helped students who needed help in different subjects. But my strengths were in English and reading. One boy, Adrian, had trouble reading. He was in third or fourth grade. I think he was having a big problem. Some letters he could read well, but not others. This was strange.\n\nAdrian spoke perfect English, but I learned that his mother did not speak English. She spoke only Spanish. I know a little Spanish, but not much. We talked a little. Then I understood the problem. Adrian could read, but he did not know the English alphabet well.\n\nI share this story to talk about the problem of language barriers in schools. Even students who speak good English can still have trouble reading. I think everyone agrees this is a problem. What can we do? For Adrian, the answer was simple. He needed help with reading and the alphabet.\n\nBut for students who do not speak much English, the answer is not simple. There is no one solution. We need to try many things. These are bilingual education, English as a Second Language (ESL) classes, and private tutors. We need to use all of these things together.\n\nOne good idea is bilingual education. This is when students learn in two languages. This helps students do well in school. Some people are afraid of this idea. They think it is a waste of money and that most students will not benefit. But this is not true. If we used this idea in all schools, all students would benefit.\n\nHow can we make this happen? Do we need all teachers to speak two languages? No, this would be hard. But we can have special helpers who speak two languages. These helpers can work with students who need extra help.",

Many people accept the religion their parents teach.  But some people reject it.  They do not believe there is something beyond what they know.  We may change our minds and choose a different way.  Every person chooses a path to understand spirituality in their own way.  We look for a light in the dark to guide us.\n\nI asked my father about his favorite bird one day.  We were on our front porch, listening to the rain.  He stared out into the rain.  He looked thin and tired.  His hair was thinning.  I felt sad and afraid.

The doctors tried to make him feel better, but it was not easy.  He suffered for a few more months than the doctors said he would.  I could not understand why he had to suffer so much.  If God existed, I thought, he was not listening to me.\n\nI did not want to watch my father die.  I wanted to remember how he lived, not how he died.  I wanted my father to be happy, not sad and weak.  I curled up in bed for three days and waited for the news.  No one called me to tell me about my father's death.",
            "The Gothic Novel is called an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New'\" by Ian Watt. This means it is a mix of old and new things. The Gothic style has been both praised and criticized. Some people think it has no real meaning, while others say it is powerful and exciting. The first Gothic Novel was written by Horace Walpole. He combined old ideas from medieval times with new ideas from modern novels. This created a new way of writing.\n\nHorace Walpole's book, The Castle of Otranto, used old theatrical ideas and new ways to write about nature. He called it \"A Gothic Story.\" The Gothic style uses old ideas from medieval times, like theater and architecture. Many people thought the word \"gothic\" was old-fashioned and not sophisticated. But the combination of old and new made the Gothic style stay popular for a long time.\n\nOne important idea in Gothic novels is chivalry. Chivalry is a set of rules for knights to follow. It includes being brave, honorable, and strong. Gothic writers liked this idea because it showed a perfect person. They wanted to show how society was not perfect and that we need to be better. The writer of The Castle of Otranto, Horace Walpole, was worried about the future. He thought the world was not a good place. He used the idea of chivalry to show how we should be better. The main character, Frederic, is a prince who has suffered a lot. He is brave, kind, and strong like a knight. This is an example of how the Gothic style uses old ideas to make a new kind of story.",
            "Supply chain management is the process of moving goods from the customer to the final product. It includes many steps: getting raw materials, making the product, storing it, and sending it to the customer. The idea of supply chain management was created in 1982 by a man named Keith Oliver. He said that the goal is to satisfy customers quickly and efficiently.\n\nThere are six key parts of a supply chain. They are production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these parts to serve customers well.\n\nProduction is the first step. It is the beginning of the supply chain process. Managers must know what customers want. They look at the market to find out. The market tells them what customers need. Once managers understand what customers want, they decide what products to make and how many. They must choose where to make the products and which factory will work best. They think about the customer's needs and wants.\n\nAfter deciding where to make the products, managers focus on planning work and taking care of machines. Production is a very important part of the supply chain. Every detail is important. If details are not planned well, the company may lose time and money. For example, a company like Wal-Mart has a plan for everything. They design a plan for how employees dress, how to receive shipments from trucks, and more. This helps the company work smoothly and avoid problems.\n\nSupply is the second key part of supply chain management. Supply means making decisions about how to make a product and which companies to partner with. A company may have many divisions that make different parts of a product. Managers decide which division is best for each part. They may also decide to work with other companies to make some parts. This is called outsourcing. Outsourcing helps a company make products quickly and at a low cost.",
            "The sign on the street corner says Hitler is alive in Burma. Ellen Page, a famous actress, stands alone holding a cardboard sign. She wants people to know about a problem in Burma, also called Myanmar. It is a country in Southeast Asia. A group of powerful military leaders rule the country. They took control in 1962 by overthrowing the government. Many Burmese people are opposed to their rule.\n\nIn 2007, people in the streets began to protest. The protests were led by Buddhist monks. They wore yellow robes, so the protests were called the Saffron Revolution. At first, the government allowed the monks to hold peaceful meetings. But soon, the situation became violent. The military attacked the monks and destroyed their homes. Journalists from other countries were arrested. A Japanese photographer was killed in September 2007 for taking pictures of a protest. Many more people were killed than reported.\n\nThis is not a new problem. Governments have tried to control their people for thousands of years. In ancient Rome, leaders said they were chosen by gods to rule. In Japan, the emperor was believed to be a god. Some people think our own government leader has bad advisors who want more power.\n\nWe have seen many examples of governments hurting their own people. In 1989, students and workers in China protested against the government. Many people were killed. The government said 200-300 people died, but others said 2,000-3,000 died. In Rwanda, a group of people killed many others just because of their ethnic group. Hitler's government in Germany also killed many people who were Jewish.",
            "Duke Ellington was a great jazz musician. He lived a long time and made many good music. He was very good at making music with his orchestra. Ellington played the piano in some of his songs, but he was also a great composer. He wrote music that showed how good each musician in his orchestra was. He gave each musician a special chance to play. This made his orchestra sound very good. \n\nEllington was very good at writing music that was new and exciting. He did not just write music for the whole orchestra. He also wrote music for each musician to play their own part. This made the orchestra sound very good together. His music was original and new. It was one of the best in the history of jazz.\n\nA music book says Ellington was very good at using voice as a special sound in his music. He used voice to make his music sound better. This was new at that time. Ellington was also good at making his musicians sound good on their instruments. He wrote music that fit each musician's special sound. \n\nOne of Ellington's songs, Creole Love Call, is a good example. In this song, Ellington used voice to make a special sound. He used voice like an instrument. This was one of the first times he did this. Creole Love Call is a slow song. It has six parts. Each part is different. \n\nIn the first part, the voice and the woodwind instruments talk to each other. The voice starts smooth and then gets rougher at the end. \n\nIn the second part, a trumpet player plays a solo. He plays a long note and then a short note. He makes a sad sound. \n\nIn the third part, a clarinet player plays a high note. The piano player plays a special rhythm. \n\nIn the fourth part, the whole orchestra plays. The brass and woodwind instruments talk to each other. \n\nIn the fifth part, the woodwind instruments start the conversation. The brass and rhythm instruments play a special rhythm. \n\nIn the sixth part, the voice and the woodwind instruments talk to each other again. This time the voice sounds like it is screaming. \n\nThe last part of the song is short. The voice sings a fast note and the trombone player plays a strange sound. \n\nEllington used voice to make his music sound better. This is one of the things he was good at. \n\nIn another song, Hot and Bothered, Ellington uses his skill at writing music for the whole orchestra. He also uses his ear for special sounds. A trumpet player and a singer make a special sound together. They talk to each other with their music. \n\nIn another song, It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), Ellington uses a trombone player to play the melody. The trombone player plays a special sound. \n\nEllington was a very good musician. He made many good music and was very creative.",

She often thought about what could be wrong with her. She thought about it for a long time. But she could not find the answer.\n\nEvery day at home was usually calm. Her parents were kind and quiet.

            "This study looked at how following the \"Mediterranean Diet\" can help prevent heart disease and stroke. The Mediterranean Diet is a type of diet that includes more plant foods, such as fruits, nuts, and whole grains, and less animal products. \n\nPrevious studies showed that a Mediterranean diet helps reduce the risk of dying from heart disease. But this study is different because it looked at the connection between the diet and the risk of stroke.\n\nThe study followed 74,886 women who were between 38 and 63 years old. They were all part of a group of 121,700 nurses in 11 US states. The women answered questions about their eating habits six times between 1984 and 2004. They were asked to report what they ate during the past year. More than 95% of the women stayed in the study for the 20 years.\n\nThe researchers checked to see if the women had heart disease, a heart attack, or a stroke. They looked at medical records, hospital records, and death certificates to make sure the information was correct. If the records were not available, they counted the cases as \"probable.\"\n\nThe researchers calculated how well the women followed the Mediterranean diet by giving them a score. They then averaged the scores from the six times the women answered the questions. They adjusted the scores for things that could affect the results, like age, smoking, and physical activity.\n\nThe study showed that women who followed the Mediterranean diet closely had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. During the 20 years of the study, 2,391 women had heart disease, 1,763 had a stroke, and 1,077 died from heart disease or stroke. Women who followed the diet closely had a 29% lower risk of heart disease and stroke compared to those who did not follow the diet.",
            "In 2007, the United States had a big economic problem. Many people lost their jobs, the value of homes went down, and some of the biggest companies in America failed. This problem, called a recession, still exists today. We need to ask: how did this happen, and how can we stop it?\n\nThe economic problem was caused by bad decisions made by politicians. They pushed banks and companies to make bad loans to people who could not pay them back. These loans were given to people who did not have enough money to pay. The problem was made worse because the country's financial system was not strong enough. Two big companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, helped to sell these bad loans to other people. When the people who borrowed the money could not pay, the banks lost money and gave it to the people who bought the bad loans.\n\nThis problem started in the 1990s. The president at that time, Bill Clinton, wanted to stay in office for another term. To do this, he made it easier for people to get loans to buy homes. This made the housing market grow, but it also made it more likely for people to borrow too much money and not be able to pay it back. \n\nA reporter from the New York Times wrote in 1999: \"Fannie Mae was in trouble because it was giving loans to people who could not pay them back.\" He said that if there was a bad economy, the government might have to help Fannie Mae. This is exactly what happened.\n\nMany factors made the economy get worse. New kinds of loans and investments were created, which made it harder for people to understand what they were doing. These new loans and investments made many people put all their money in the housing market. When the housing market crashed, the people who had invested in these loans lost a lot of money.\n\nThe problem was very big. The top five banks in the United States had $4.1 trillion dollars of bad loans in 2007. This is a huge amount of money, about 30% of the country's total wealth. In the end, some of these banks were sold or forced to change how they worked. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had $5 trillion dollars of bad loans and were put under government control in 2008.",
            "Exposition is a part of a story where writers show more information about the characters, setting, or plot. But too much exposition can be boring and make readers lose interest.\n\nYou may already know the writing tip \"Show, don't tell.\" But sometimes writers still write too much information. Exposition is when a writer tells the audience what happened. It can happen in many ways, like in a movie when one character tells another a lot of information.\n\nFor example, you might be reading a story and learn that a main character met someone she loved, got married, and then her husband was killed. But instead of just saying that, the writer should show how the character felt and what she learned from her husband. This makes readers more connected to the character and care about what happens to her.\n\nIn this example, the writer might show how the husband loved his wife by what he said and did. The writer could also show how the wife felt about her husband and how he changed her life. This would make readers feel sad when he dies and more connected to the wife.\n\nAs a writer, it's your job to add meat to the story. Don't rush past important parts. If you introduce a new character, give them some history. But don't tell too much at once. For example, you might say a character used to be in the Air Force and now works at a gas station. That's a good start. You could also say he likes to fish and has big dreams. But leave some things to the reader's imagination.",

He was named Shad Hostettler. They showed his picture. He looked very bad. The news program gave this story only two minutes because it was still developing. They said he had hurt his wife many times and was arrested.\n\nThe next story was about a man named Travis Buyers, 18, who was shot in the Sharon Woods area. He was very badly hurt. The police were investigating. They had not found the person who hurt him. This story was short. I think it was short because the man who was hurt was black. I have noticed before that when a black person is a victim of a crime, they do not get much attention in the news. If a white person is a victim, the news makes a big deal about it.\n\nThe next story was about a helicopter that was hit by a bullet. The police think it happened in a certain area. They said it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. The police want people to help find the person who shot the helicopter. They are offering a five-thousand-dollar reward.\n\nThe next story was about rain and thunderstorms on Saturday. They said it would be hot all weekend.\n\nThey also told a story about a robbery at a store in Columbus. The man who robbed the store was wearing a black hoodie and was black. They said he was tall and weighed a lot.\n\nAnother story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez. He was a big time drug dealer in Texas. He was sent to prison for 300 months for selling a lot of marijuana to Ohio from Texas. They also said he was Hispanic. I do not think this was important to the story.",
            "There is a special connection between brothers. This connection is strong and never breaks. Many feelings are inside this connection. They include love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers understand each other very well. They can see themselves in each other. When a brother is in trouble, the true nature of their connection is clear. It can be good or bad. When these feelings are clear, they come with a big cost. Understanding the feelings of this brotherly connection means dealing with the bad things that happen. When a brother looks at another brother, he sees himself. This helps him see what he is really like, not what others think. The brother's actions and the problems they cause show what kind of person he is. In the story \"The Scarlet Ibis\", two brothers explore this brotherly connection and the strong feelings that come with it. They go on a difficult journey through a beautiful place. In the end, one brother survives. The story shows this theme through how the main character, the older brother, acts towards his little brother, Doodle. The story also shows the narrator's point of view, which helps us understand how the main character feels about the world and his brother. These feelings affect the main character's actions.\n\nThe main character's actions are about one feeling: pride. From the beginning, the main character is unhappy with his little brother, Doodle. Doodle is sick and cannot do the things the main character wants to do. The main character wants a brother to play with and learn from. He wants someone to be with him in the swamp and in the top of a big tree. But Doodle is too weak. He cannot do these things. The main character is very disappointed. He even thinks about hurting Doodle. But when Doodle smiles, the main character feels happy. This shows that the main character really loves his brother.",
            "The brain is a very complicated organ in the human body that helps us think and understand the world. As time went on, people used different comparisons to explain how the brain works. At first, it was like a piece of wax for writing, then a piece of paper, then a book, and now it is compared to a computer. But these comparisons are not perfect and can lead to misunderstandings.\n\nThe brain gets information from our senses. Our senses turn things like touch, heat, and light into electrical signals. These signals are changed many times in the brain as it tries to understand what they mean. For example, when you look at a picture of a black box on a white background, the brain puts together small pieces of information like color and shape to make sense of it. It then uses this information to quickly recognize the object.\n\nThe brain has a filter that decides what is important and what we should pay attention to. For example, when you look at the ground, your brain sees many blades of grass, but you do not notice them. But if someone says your name, you quickly hear it.\n\nThe brain processes information in many steps. It also uses a special attention filter to decide what information is important and what is not. There are different kinds of memory, including short-term and long-term memory. First, the brain takes in information and codes it in a way that makes sense. Then, it stores the information. There are different ways to store different kinds of information. For example, if you hear a word, your brain stores it in a way that involves how it sounds.\n\nThere are many ideas about how the brain stores and organizes knowledge. Some ideas come from how people remember things, others from computers, and others from the study of the brain itself. One idea is that the brain has a network of connections between concepts, like \"chair\" and \"table.\" These connections help us understand how things are related to each other.",
            "Aldous Huxley writes about a future world where people value community over individual freedom. This world is like a science fiction nightmare. The people in this world do not think for themselves. They are taught to be happy and not to question the system. They are controlled by a leader who calls himself the \"World Controller.\" \n\nHuxley is writing about the dangers of a system where people do not have freedom. He is saying that this system is like communism in a way. Communism is an economic system where the government controls everything. People do not have choices; they are told what to do. In Huxley's story, people are conditioned to be happy, but they are not truly happy. They are like robots. \n\nThe people in this world are divided into classes. The upper classes are smart and powerful. They have everything they need. The lower classes are not as smart and have less power. They are like machines, doing what they are told. They do not question the system.\n\nHuxley is saying that this system is bad. People should be free to make their own choices. They should be able to love and think for themselves. But in this world, love and true feelings are not allowed. People only care about how things look. They do not care about what is inside.\n\nThe people in this world are like puppets on strings. They are controlled by the system. They do not have their own thoughts or feelings. They are like machines. This is what Huxley is saying is wrong with the world. He is saying that people should be free and not controlled by the system.\n\nHuxley is using a way of thinking called Marxism. Marxism is a way of understanding how the world works. It says that the rich people control the poor people. In Huxley's story, the upper classes control the lower classes. The lower classes do what they are told, and they are happy about it. But Huxley is saying that this is not true happiness. This is a false happiness. The people in this world are not truly happy. They are just pretending to be happy.\n\nHuxley is warning us about the dangers of a system where people are controlled. He is saying that we should be free to make our own choices. We should be able to love and think for ourselves. We should not be like puppets on strings, controlled by the system.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for about two and a half years. Getting around campus can be hard. My freshman year, I lived in a dorm on the east side of campus, far from other buildings. Walking to classes in buildings like Willard, near the center of campus, took up to 25 minutes. The weather was often bad, making it even harder. I learned that not long ago, there was a lot of empty land between the dorms and other buildings. Now, this space has buildings, sports fields, and apartments. As the campus grows, it gets harder to move around. The best solution is a bicycle. But it is not enough to just have a bike. Students must ride them, and the campus must be designed for bicyclists.\n\nI talked to a friend who rides a bike again after a few years. He said, \"Bikes are great. For a while, it wasn't cool, but now it's the best way to get around.\" Bicycling is good for your body and very efficient. You can go 30 miles or more with a bowl of oatmeal and some exercise. I live off campus, near the center of campus. I bought a bike this year, and it was a good decision. Now, I can get to my class in Thomas building in 5 minutes if I ride fast. But the road to Thomas building is not always easy to ride on. I also like the idea of walking, but I am very busy. If I didn't have a bike, I would have to walk. Walking to Thomas building would take 30-40 minutes. That is over two and a half hours every week. I don't have that much time."
