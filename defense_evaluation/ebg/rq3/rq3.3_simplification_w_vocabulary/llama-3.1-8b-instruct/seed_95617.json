            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

The sociocultural model looks at how people's environments, such as their race, age, and income, affect their sleep.\n\nWe will look at some research on insomnia. This research will explain the different parts of the biological and sociocultural models. Then, we will talk about the strengths and weaknesses of each study.\n\nInsomnia is a sleep problem. It can be caused by different things. Sometimes, it is a sleep problem by itself. Other times, it is a problem connected to another mental health issue. There are several kinds of sleep problems. They can be caused by medical problems or by taking certain medicines.\n\nThere are two kinds of sleep problems. One kind is called Dyssonmias. The other kind is called Parasomnias. Dyssonmias are problems with falling asleep or staying asleep. Parasomnias are problems with acting out or moving while asleep.\n\nThe biological model says that genetics and health problems can cause insomnia. Our brains have special cells that help us sleep. These cells are in the part of the brain called the hypothalamus. These cells contain a substance that helps us sleep. If these cells do not work correctly, we may have trouble sleeping.\n\nOne study looked at mice and found that a special receptor in the brain helps us sleep. This receptor is called the GABAB receptor. If this receptor is not working correctly, we may have trouble sleeping. The study found that a medicine can help people sleep by affecting this receptor.\n\nThe sociocultural model says that our environment affects our sleep. If we have a family history of insomnia, we may be more likely to have insomnia. If we are under a lot of stress, we may have trouble sleeping.\n\nThis study shows that genetics and the environment can affect our sleep. It also shows that we may be able to cure insomnia by using medicine that affects the GABAB receptor.",
            "This paper is about Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). CAPD is a problem with the brain. It is not a hearing problem. People with CAPD can hear sounds, but their brain has trouble understanding what they hear.\n\nThe brain helps us understand what we hear. It separates sounds and helps us know what someone is saying. People with CAPD have trouble with this part of the brain. It is called the central nervous system (CNS).\n\nCAPD was first talked about in the 1950s. Researchers studied children with speech problems. They made tests to help diagnose the problem. In 1954, a team of researchers in Italy started working on these tests. In 1961, another researcher came up with a way to test how the brain works when it hears two sounds at the same time.\n\nCAPD can cause problems with hearing. A person with CAPD may not know where a sound is coming from. They may have trouble hearing two or more sounds. They may not understand speech patterns. They may not know when someone is being serious or not. They may not be able to block out background noise. They may not be able to make sense of what they hear.\n\nTo find out if someone has CAPD, doctors use tests. These tests look at how the person hears and responds to sounds. There are many types of tests. Doctors may ask questions or watch how the person behaves. There is no single test that can diagnose CAPD. Tests may include listening to many sounds and then trying to pick out certain words or numbers.\n\nTeachers can help students with CAPD in a regular classroom. They can make sure the student sits in a quiet place. They can ask the student to repeat what they hear. They can break down instructions into simple steps.

Viola also has feelings for a man in the play, but she is pretending to be a man so she can't express her true feelings.\n\nThe play may be saying that lying can help people see their true feelings. Some characters in the play may have feelings they don't want to admit. They see the person pretending to be someone else and that makes them think about their own feelings. For example, a woman in the play falls in love with a man who is pretending to be a woman. But she quickly falls in love with a real man who looks like the person she fell in love with.

            "The German colonial rule was very cruel. It killed many people, especially the Ovaherero and Nama in South West Africa. But the German colonial rule was not the same everywhere. The policies and way of ruling were different in different places. The German colonies were very different from each other.\n\nThe colonies with educated Africans were in East Africa. The British took over this area in 1919. They found many Africans who could read and write. German education in Kamerun and other colonies was also very good.\n\nBut South West Africa was different. The government did not help Africans much with education. Only a few organizations that were not the government helped Africans learn. The government spent more money on schools for Europeans. The government also controlled the schools for Europeans. This made a big difference in South West Africa. Many Africans did not go to school and could not read or write.\n\nOther German colonies had many educated Africans. But in South West Africa, most people were not educated. This was because of many reasons. We will talk about these reasons in this paper. We will also look at how European settlers and the government felt about Africans.\n\nThere are many books and studies about education in German colonies. Most of these were written in German a long time ago. Later, people wrote about education in different colonies and how it was the same or different. One person, Cohen, studied education in South West Africa and East Africa. He said that the number of European settlers in South West Africa was a main reason for the difference in education.\n\nSouth West Africa was a place with a good climate. Many Europeans lived there because it was not too hot. In 1913, 15,000 Europeans lived in South West Africa. This was more than in any other German colony except East Africa.",
            "Heavy metal music is a big group of music styles. It has grown a lot over the past 100 years. Many subgroups of heavy metal have developed. Some of these subgroups have smaller subgroups. This makes it hard to list all kinds of heavy metal music.\n\nHeavy metal music started out a long time ago. But over the years, it has changed a lot. People started to make their own types of heavy metal music. This led to many new kinds of heavy metal. Today, there are many different kinds of heavy metal.\n\nSo, what is heavy metal music? Heavy metal music is known for being loud and dark. It often has strong beats and strong guitar sounds. Many people in heavy metal bands are very good at playing their instruments. They put a lot of feeling into their music.\n\nHeavy metal music is also connected to the use of drugs. In the 1970s, many people used drugs to create their music. This led to some strange and unusual sounds. Some people say that the use of drugs helped create the dark and crazy sound that is typical of heavy metal music.\n\nMany heavy metal songs have lyrics that are about dark and sad things. These lyrics reflect the darker side of life. One of the first heavy metal songs was \"Helter Skelter.\" It was written by the Beatles and is about the ups and downs of life. It was a response to a song by the Rolling Stones. The Beatles wanted to show that they could make music that was just as heavy and dark as the Stones.",
            "Henri Rousseau was a famous painter. He painted a picture called The Dream in 1910. This painting shows a woman who is very happy in a dream world. But The Dream is more than just a picture. It shows Rousseau's own dreams and goals as a painter. He wanted to be recognized and liked by other artists and people who love art.\n\nRousseau had a hard time achieving his goal. He had to decide if he should paint like other artists or be different. He wanted to fit in with the art world, but he also wanted to be himself.\n\nTo understand The Dream, we need to know something about Rousseau's life. He was born in a town in northwest France in 1844. His father was a hardware dealer and had a good job. Rousseau grew up without learning art. He worked for the government until he was 40 years old. People called him a customs inspector, but he was really a gabelou.\n\nRousseau's first wife died when their eight children were young. He was left with a daughter and a lot of sadness. He started painting to feel better and find a new life. Unlike other artists who painted about the poor, Rousseau painted about everyday people like himself.\n\nRousseau wanted to be accepted by the art world. He was older than many other artists, and they were famous already. But he didn't get recognition until the same time that another artist, Matisse, was becoming famous. They were different because Matisse wanted to paint in a new way, but Rousseau wanted to paint in a way that was accepted by the art world.",
            "We know that many great thinkers believe there is a strong connection between ethics and beauty, between what is true and what is good. I agree with this idea. The poet John Keats said, \"Beauty is truth. Truth is beauty. That is all you need to know.\" We learn many things in life through education and experience, but we also feel that ethics and aesthetics are special. They are not just rules or laws. Our studies of morality and beauty try to explain why something is beautiful or why an action is right. But we cannot fully explain these things. When we talk about a great work of art or literature, we can talk about its details, but we often can't fully explain why it is so good.\n\nFor example, we can discuss the details of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, but we can't fully describe what makes it beautiful. When we talk about our favorite work of art or literature, we often say things like, \"There is just something about it.\" This \"something\" is hard to explain. I believe that both art and morality have this quality. As the writer Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that cannot be said in any other way.\" We can describe the details of a story, but there is something more to it.\n\nI think that ethics and aesthetics are connected because they work in the same way. We experience them at a deep level, but we can't fully explain them. This connection is even stronger with literature. Literature is special because it deals with values. Literature helps us understand what is important in life. The writer McKean said, \"What makes literature special is its moral quality. Literature is important to us because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany is a strong country today. It is a united country with a mix of cultures. You can feel this mix in many places in Germany. From München, near the Alps, to Kiel, a city by the Baltic Sea. You can also feel it in Köln, on the river Rhine, and in Dresden, on the Elbe River.\n\nGermany has a unique culture. But it comes from many different places. Many different tribes lived in Germany long ago. The country is called Germania. Scholars and historians do not agree on where the name came from. Some think it came from a group of people called the Tungrians.\n\nA long time ago, a Roman leader named Julius Caesar wrote about the people of Germania. He used the word \"Germanus\" to describe them. He got this word from the Gauls, a group of people he fought against. Caesar used the word to show the difference between the Gauls and the people he had not yet defeated.\n\nSome people think the word \"German\" comes from a spear called a \"ger\". Others think it comes from an old Irish word \"garim\", which means \"to shout\". This might mean that the Germans were loud.\n\nA Roman historian named Tacitus wrote about the origins of the Germans. He said that the Germans were an old group of people who did not mix with other groups. They lived in a rough country with bad weather and were not easy to live with. Not many people from Rome wanted to live in Germany.\n\nThe Romans would sometimes send armies to Germany to get goods. But they usually went back to Rome. The Germanic tribes lived on the edge of the Roman Empire. They traded with the Romans and served in the Roman army.",
            "I looked down at the toilet in front of me. My mind was empty. I did not think about the toilet or what I was seeing. I just looked. My brain was like a tool that worked by itself. It took in what I was seeing, but did not think about it.\n\nI had always wanted to draw. When I was six years old, I started to think about drawing. Later, I found a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" It teaches people to draw. One thing it says to do is to put a square around the thing you want to draw. This makes it easier to see.\n\nI could not do that with the toilet in front of me. It was too much. I was amazed. Many artists have their own way of seeing things. Picasso liked blue. Monet liked green. The old masters used all the colors. If I wanted to be a good artist, I had to start by looking at this brown thing in front of me.\n\nMy hand moved to the toilet handle. I pulled it down. But the brown thing did not move. I pulled it down again. It still did not move.\n\nI grabbed a mop and stood in front of the toilet. I was not happy. Someone had left a messy present for the toilet cleaners at Rite Aid. I used the mop to try and get the brown thing out of the toilet. I used the toilet paper to make my hand warm and protected. Then I slowly put my hand in the toilet bowl. It was like putting a turkey in the oven for Thanksgiving.",
            "More and more teenagers are dying in car accidents.  Several reasons work together to cause this problem.  One reason is that the young brain is not ready for the dangers of driving.  The young brain is not experienced.  This lack of experience causes many deaths.  It also causes many accidents, such as turning over, speeding, and driving off the road.\n\nTeenagers are also more likely to have accidents when they drive with their friends.  A study in California found that the number of car accidents increases with the age of the passenger.\n\nSome states, including California, have made a rule for teenagers who are learning to drive.  These rules say that teenagers can only drive for a few hours a day and cannot drive with friends who are also teenagers.  But I think these rules are not enough.  The real problem is that young drivers are not good at handling the dangers of driving.\n\nA psychologist named Marvin Zuckerman says that people under 20 years old are not ready to drive.  He has studied how young people like to take risks.  This makes sense.  If we give driver's licenses to young teenagers, many more people will be hurt or killed in car accidents.  In a few years, the number of deaths will be very high.  Many more teenagers will be able to drive soon.\n\nIf we want to keep our teenagers safe, we need to make a rule that says no one under 18 can drive a car.  Schools can still teach teenagers how to drive.  But teenagers must wait until they are 18 to get a driver's license.  We can still give teenagers a special permit that allows them to practice driving with an adult.  They must practice for a certain number of hours before they can take a test to get a driver's license.\n\nThis is not a new idea.  Many states already have rules like this.  We can make a rule that is the same for all states.  This will help keep our teenagers safe.",
            "I looked at films from the Library of Congress. I chose to watch trick films from 1895 to 1901. There were 15 of these films. They trick the eye with creative editing. My study of these films looked at their artistic side and how they changed over time. \n\nMost of these films stay in one place and do not move. The camera does not move. The films are long and use many shots to create an illusion. \n\nOne thing trick films have in common is they are shot in a fixed place. The camera does not move to follow people or objects. This style came from theater and magic shows. In these films, people move side to side. They do not move towards or away from the camera. \n\nMost trick films are long shots or medium shots. They are not close-ups. This is like theater, where the audience sees the whole performance. Actors do not move towards the camera. \n\nMost trick films are short, usually less than a minute. They are like magic tricks. They do tricks, like making things disappear or change. One trick film shot does not always mean one physical shot. It might be many shots joined together to make an illusion. \n\nOne early trick film is The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots. At first, it looks like one shot. But if you look closely, you can see when the camera shot of Mary's fake head starts. The whole film looks like one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a strong supporter of Republican ideas. He was a farmer, but his work and short time in politics made him known for caring about personal freedom and government. He believed that farming was the best way of life, and this idea guided his thoughts on the government. He wanted to protect and support farmers, which influenced his views on power, laws, and the justice system.\n\nJohn Taylor thought the United States had a great chance to create a perfect system of government. There was no old tradition to follow, so the country's founders could create a system that worked for everyone. He believed in the natural rights of people, which are basic rights that everyone has. He thought that if one person does not have these rights, others will suffer too. These rights should not be controlled by the government.\n\nTaylor believed that in a society, some people might use their strength and cleverness to get what they want. But in a country, this should not be the way things work. To create a good society, the government should understand that people have good and bad qualities. Taylor thought that a government should protect private property, help farmers, and prevent people from getting too much power. He believed that a government like this would work well no matter who was in charge.\n\nTaylor also believed that people are motivated by self-interest, but this is only bad if it means hurting others. He thought a good government should control people's bad qualities and watch out for bad principles that can harm society. A good government would keep people from being cruel to each other.\n\nTaylor wanted the government to limit its power, as stated in the Constitution. He thought a big government was expensive and could be unfair. However, he also believed that following the Constitution too strictly could lead to problems. He thought the Declaration of Independence was more important because it said the United States was a group of independent states, not just one country.",
            "We look at Figure 17. There was a big drop in commuter log entries in the third month of the project. This was not good news. We do not know why this happened. It is possible that the drop in people walking or biking because of winter weather is partly to blame. In New England, people often need to walk or bike less in winter. In December, students and teachers are busy finishing schoolwork and getting grades. They may not have time to fill out the commuter log. This month also starts the holiday season. Many people do not need to go to school for a month. Classes will start again in late January. But we do not understand why people were not filling out the log in February. Maybe people have less energy at the beginning of a project like this. We tried to solve this problem by creating the Carpool Challenge Week. This was a special effort to get people excited about the project again. It worked and we got more log entries in March. So, we need to find a way to keep people interested in the project. We also need to fight against people's love of driving their cars. This is a big problem in our culture. We tried to solve this by offering prizes like gift cards. We gave these out at local restaurants, coffee shops, and stores. We thought this would help people change their behavior. But it would have been interesting to see if bigger prizes would help even more. For example, we could have given away a bike, a hybrid car, or an electric car. This could have helped people be more interested in the project. The prizes we offered did not change during the project. If we had offered bigger prizes in December and January, it might have helped people be more interested.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that follows a group of stocks or a commodity.  It is like an index fund but is more flexible and can be bought and sold on an exchange like a stock.  ETFs give you the benefits of many stocks and the ability to buy and sell easily.  They have low costs, but you must pay a commission to buy or sell them.  Many ETFs are available.  Before buying an ETF, it is a good idea to look at its benefits and see if they are real.\n\nWe will look at the ETF IHF.  This ETF has ten main stocks that make up 63.58% of all its assets.  We will compare the returns and risks of these ten stocks to the ETF as a whole.  If we use the same amounts of these ten stocks together, we can see how well they represent the ETF.\n\nOur calculations show that these ten stocks could give a 16% higher return than the ETF.  They also have less risk.  But we need to know if these results are real or just a chance.  To do this, we will look at the risk of each stock and see how much it adds to the overall risk of the portfolio.\n\nWe will examine the standard deviation of each stock to see if the portfolio of ten stocks is truly less risky than the ETF.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe says \"Dream-Land\" is one of his best poems. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe uses the word \"Thulé.\" He got this word from a famous writer named Virgil. Virgil used \"Thulé\" to describe an island north of Britain. This island was the edge of the known world for the Greeks.\n\nPoe was interested in German writers. One of them is Goethe. Poe liked Goethe's writing. In fact, some people think Poe copied some of Goethe's ideas. A man named Karl J. Arndt wrote a book about this. He said Poe's poem \"Politian\" is similar to Goethe's poem \"Mignon.\"\n\nGoethe was a well-known writer of a play called \"Faust.\" This play was published in two parts. The first part was released in 1808, and the second part was released in 1832 when Goethe died. Inside \"Faust,\" there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem is about a king who loses his wife. After she dies, he drinks a lot and cries. He then decides to die too. Before he dies, he gives his money and things to his children. The only thing he keeps is a special cup his wife gave him. He goes to a cliff, throws the cup into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The king in \"The King of Thulé\" and the king in Poe's \"Dream-Land\" are very similar. They both have a sad story about loss.\n\nPoe mentions Thulé twice in his writings. He says \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" but he uses \"Thulé\" twice in \"Dream-Land.\" \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" are like two poems that go together. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker says he is in a place called Thulé. He describes Thulé as a dark and lonely place. He sees dead friends and a world without color. This is similar to \"The King of Thule\" by Goethe. In \"The King of Thule,\" the king is also lonely and has lost his wife. He has lost his will to live.\n\nGoethe was a famous writer that Poe liked. Poe respected another writer named Tennyson. Poe admired Tennyson's work. Poe would have known Goethe's work because of Tennyson. Poe also saw many reproductions of Goethe's writing after it was first published.",
            "In California, a customer who gets hurt after slipping and falling on a spill in a store can ask for extra money from the store. This money is called punitive damages. But to get it, the customer must prove that the store manager acted with mean intention. \n\nImagine a customer slipped and fell on applesauce in a store. The store manager knew about the spill twice, but he did not clean it for 30 minutes because he was eating dinner. A judge is not likely to throw out the customer's claim for extra money. The customer must show that the manager knew his actions could cause harm and he did not care. \n\nThere was a problem with spills in the store before. Many customers had slipped and fallen. The manager knew about this. But he did nothing to fix the problem. This is why the customer is asking for extra money. The customer will say that the manager was mean and did not care about the harm he could cause.\n\nA manager at the store found out about the spill twice. He said he was busy eating dinner and did not have time to clean it. But he did not clean it for 30 minutes. The customer slipped and fell and got hurt.

The customer is suing the store for money to pay for her injury and to punish the store for its actions.\n\nIn California, a customer can ask for extra money if the store manager acted with mean intention.

            "Four years ago, I took a course in Islam at CBC.  We discussed whether Islam is a hostile religion.  Now this question is more important than ever.  I have seen how the media changed its view of Islam.  After 9/11, the media was against Islam.  Now it is very tolerant.  I think it is interesting that in 2001, a presidential candidate like Barack Obama could come to power.  He has Muslim family members.\n\nI am interested in the story of the Prophet Muhammad.  What I learned about him did not match his biography.  I thought he forced people to become Muslims.  He took over tribes and made them join Islam.  But his biography says he was a humble person who was often misunderstood.  People came to him because they believed in his teachings.\n\nThere are many similarities between Muhammad's life and the life of Jesus.  One example is when Muhammad had very little food and made it multiply so that many people could eat.  This kind of writing makes me think the authors wanted Muhammad to look like a humble prophet who did not need to prove anything.  He just lived a truthful life with miracles.  I think this is a problem because it makes Jesus' life and teachings seem less important.\n\nI do not like the way the biography presents stories.  Many of the stories come from people who heard from others.  This makes the stories seem suspicious.  I think the authors wanted to show that people converted to Islam on their own.  But I do not think this is true.\n\nWhat worries me most is that the biography tries to make Muhammad look like a good and humble person.  But history says he was not like that.  I wonder if Muslims today know the truth about Muhammad's past.",
            "We can see a change in Christian thought since Jesus' time.  People did not follow his teachings after he died.  A new path was chosen.  If we look at history, we can see a pattern.  Christians moved away from what Jesus believed.  Today, we see many people are more open-minded.  They want to know more about the past.  Traditional people will still exist, but they will not be the only ones.  Many Christians will learn more about Jesus' life and teachings.  They will want to know the original ideas of the Christian religion.  It may take time, but the result will be clear:  Christians will go back to the beginning.  They will remove ideas that were added later.  They will go back to what Jesus said.  It will be like a clock moving backward.  Only the true ideas of Jesus will remain.\n\nIn the United States and Europe, people will follow Jesus' ideas more closely.  They will worship like he taught.  The church will still be strong, but it will be simpler.  People will follow the same ideas everywhere.  We will see less difference between different Christian groups.  History shows us that this can happen.  Christians were once treated badly by the Roman Empire.  But later the empire became Christian.  Our country went from being against African-American rights to having African-American leaders.  The same thing will happen with Christianity.  People will go back to the source.  They will see that Jesus' words are not always meant to be taken literally.\n\nLooking back in history, we see that Christianity started with Judaism.  The Jewish people had many different groups.  They had Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and many common people.  They did not agree on everything.  By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., the Jewish people believed in one God.  They believed in the Bible and its teachings.  But they were not the same.  They had different ideas.",

            "Many writers use different ways to make readers feel a certain way about important subjects. \nF. Scott Fitzgerald uses these techniques in his book The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, he pairs a word with another word that do not usually fit together to create a certain feeling. Other times, he gives meaning to a symbol and uses it for the same purpose. \n\nFitzgerald uses the last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white, gray, and red. He builds meaning for these colors and then uses it to show readers a feeling about an important thing. \n\nFitzgerald creates meaning for white and gray. He thinks white is better and more upper class, and gray is older and faded. He shows this in the beginning of the book by using these colors many times. \n\nDaisy and Jordan are always wearing white. Everyone wears white at Gatsby's party. Nick wears white clothes, Tom wears a white shirt, and Catherine looks very white. The only time people are not wearing white is when Nick describes Gatsby's party and sees many bright colors. Fitzgerald also uses white and gray to describe ordinary things. \n\nAs Nick goes to work, he goes down a white valley in New York. The names of people at Gatsby's party are gray on Nick's list. Catherine's apartment is like a long white cake. He also describes ordinary people and places as white or gray. Jordan and Daisy have a white childhood, there are gray cars and land in a sad place, an Italian child is gray, and a dog-seller is an old gray man.\n\nAfter Fitzgerald gives meaning to white and gray, he uses them to show readers that something is not important or is the same. He uses this technique with Daisy first. After a long time, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as a woman in white. Readers start to see Daisy as not a person, but as something Gatsby wants. \n\nFitzgerald uses this technique many times with Daisy to show that she is not special. For example, there is a gray fog on Daisy's fur, and she wears a white dress before Tom and Gatsby meet.",
            "San Diego County is a great place for growing food. The climate is good and the sun shines a lot. Farmers grow many things here, including tomatoes, oranges, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, and honey. People want to eat food grown without chemicals, and many organizations in San Diego have long waiting lists. Many farmers also sell organic eggs and milk.\n\nSome farms in the area allow visitors to walk around and see how they grow their food. Farmers can earn money by giving tours and offering hiking and birdwatching. This can also help the environment. The government gives money to farmers who grow food without chemicals, and this can help protect the land and wildlife.\n\nBut farming without chemicals can be harder and more expensive. Farmers must work harder and spend more time removing pests and weeds and fertilizing the soil without using chemicals. They can also lose more food than farmers who use chemicals. Small farms are less efficient than big farms because they do not have as much land. They must also spend more time and money on things that help the environment, such as planting special crops and removing invasive plants.\n\nThe land I chose is in a place called Potrero, California. It is 160 acres of land with different types of plants and trees. Many species of plants and animals live here, including some that are endangered. The government is making a plan to protect this area and the animals that live here.\n\nPeople lived on this land for a long time before it was used for farming. It was used to raise cattle and sell wood. Now, I want to show how a farmer could grow food here and protect the environment at the same time.\n\nI found a real farm in the area and used it as an example of what a farmer could do. The farm is in the same climate and has the same types of plants and animals. The farmer can get help from the government and make money by giving tours and selling organic food.",
            "Culture is very important in any negotiation. To understand culture, we must know what it is not and what it means. Culture is not the same everywhere. It is not a single or uniform thing. Making general statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" is not helpful. It is better to learn about a culture and how it will affect the negotiation.\n\nWhen we meet a new culture, we can compare it to our own culture. We can learn about its history and its problems. Instead of judging or trying to change a culture, we should accept it and work within its rules. This is especially true if we are in a weaker position in the negotiation.\n\nCulture is not just about countries. Companies also have their own culture. In one company, people may work long hours. In another company, people may have a more relaxed schedule. We can see a company's culture in the way employees dress, how they communicate, and who they hire.\n\nValues are very important to understand. They tell us why people behave in certain ways. If saving face or being friendly is important in a culture, a negotiator will not embarrass his company to get what he wants. If a culture values getting a good deal, a negotiator will try to get the best deal he can.\n\nLearning about a culture and its values is important before a negotiation. But it is also important to get to know the other person. This can help make the negotiation more successful.",
            "There is no God, the fool has said in his heart. This idea is from the Christian Bible, in Psalm 14. Thomas Aquinas and St. Anselm both write about God. They have the same idea in mind. We will compare their ideas about God, but first, we need to agree that they are talking about the same kind of God. If we think of a different kind of God, we cannot compare their ideas. We will assume that they believe in the God of the Bible.\n\nLet's look at St. Anselm's idea. He thinks we can know God by looking inside ourselves. We can understand God by thinking about it. This means that we do not need outside proof for God's existence. We can know it is true just by thinking about it. This idea is called faith. We accept things that are true without evidence. This is a Christian idea.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas has a different idea. He thinks we can know God through reason and evidence. We do not need faith. This is a good idea for teaching others about God. People can learn about God through logic. St. Thomas gives five reasons why God exists. They are cause and effect, change, possibility, order, and perfection. He says that if we know one piece of a puzzle is missing, we can know what it looks like without seeing it.",
            "A long time ago, in the fifth or sixth century BC, a prince was born. He would later be called Buddha. This prince lived a long time ago and left the world to find inner peace. He became a wise teacher, and his teachings made Buddhism. Buddhism is a very old religion - over 2,500 years old. It has changed much since Buddha was alive. We can see this in the country of Sri Lanka, where Theravada Buddhists live. They have a special ceremony every year to cut water. Many people, both monks and people who are not monks, take part in this ceremony. However, Buddha never taught about such a celebration. Theravada Buddhism is different today than it was when Buddha was alive. This is true not just in small ways, but also in its deepest teachings. The Theravada Buddhist community has changed its ideas over time. This happened because of both good and bad things.\n\nThere are some important words we will use in this discussion. We will talk about inside and outside forces. An inside force is something that comes from people who believe in Buddhism. An outside force is something that comes from people who do not believe in Buddhism. A bad force is anything that harms the Buddhist community. A good force is anything that does not want to harm or help the Buddhist community, but it may do one or the other anyway.\n\nFirst, we need to learn about the basic ideas of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists believe in three things: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is like a book. It is made up of the Tripitaka, which is three baskets of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka has all the Buddhist talks. The Vinaya Pitaka has rules for how to live. The Abhidhamma Pitaka has ideas about the world and how it works. Some of these ideas are that we do not have a soul, that life is full of suffering, and that everything changes. If we understand these ideas, we can stop suffering. We can also stop being trapped in the cycle of death and rebirth. This cycle is called Sansara. Along with Sansara, we can stop having too much desire, hatred, and confusion. This happens when we become enlightened. The Vinaya Pitaka says how we should live. For people who are not monks, there are five rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not take something that is not yours, do not have sex with someone you should not, and do not take bad substances. For monks, there are many more rules. The most important idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. The first truth is that life is suffering. The second truth is that having too much of something can cause suffering. The third truth is that suffering can be stopped.",
            "The United States and Mexico had a long-lasting rivalry for 57 years. This rivalry started in 1836 and ended in 1893. The two countries fought a war in 1846-1848, and the United States won many battles. They took control of Texas and the American Southwest. The two countries disagreed on many issues, including religion, culture, and money. Their differences in interest led to many conflicts.\n\nThe United States and Mexico are not the only countries with a long rivalry. Countries that share a border often disagree on things. This is true for the United States and Mexico. They are not the only countries with a long rivalry. Cuba is another country that has had problems with the United States.\n\nThe United States and Mexico disagreed on religion. This is a common problem for many countries. In the past, the United States was against Catholicism. Mexico is a Catholic country. This made it hard for the two countries to have good relations.\n\nThe United States and Mexico also disagreed on who should be in power. This was a problem because of how the English and Spanish treated each other. The United States and Mexico got these feelings of distrust from their former rulers.\n\nThere were 17 fights between the United States and Mexico in 57 years. Most of these fights were over land and border problems. Some people from the United States would cross the border and cause trouble. To stop this, both countries used their armies to control their borders.\n\nAs time passed, Mexico became weaker, and the United States became stronger. This helped the rivalry end. The United States stopped wanting to take more land from Mexico and instead focused on helping Mexico economically.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became very sick. I was a nurse. I chose this job because I wanted to feel safe. When I was a child, I did not have a safe home. People told me, \"You will always find work. People are always sick.\"\n\nBut I wanted to be a scientist or a journalist. I wanted to learn many things. Even so, I chose nursing. Now I am 61 years old. I have no money. I have been on disability for 15 years. I am still very sick. Every day is hard. I need help from my family and friends. They help me a lot. I am not strong anymore.\n\nMy point is that accidents and problems can happen. We can prepare, but we cannot always solve our problems alone. We need help from others.\n\nI think we should not depend too much on the government. The government is not perfect. We should learn to help each other and ask for help. We should not build our own shelters alone.\n\nSome people say that Americans are strong and independent. But our ancestors were strong because they helped each other. They worked together. They shared food and resources. When pioneers traveled across the country, they did not go alone. They worked together.\n\nSo, be prepared. I have a disaster kit and food. I have flashlights and candles. But I also know my neighbors. You should know your neighbors too.",
            "Scientists want to know why living things change over time.  They are looking for rules that help explain how these changes happen.  Many years ago, a scientist named D'Arcy Thompson said that it is hard to use math to understand how living things develop.  Today, scientists are still trying.  A team of researchers is using math to study how shells of a type of animal called Prunum grow and change over time.\n\nThey are using X-rays to take pictures of the shells.  These pictures help them measure the shape of the shells.  They are then using a computer program to create pictures of what the shells might have looked like in the past or in the future.  This helps them understand how the shells changed over time.\n\nA shell is like a tube that grows in a spiral shape.  It turns around a center point called the columella.  The shell has lines called sutures that divide it into parts.  The last part of the shell is called the body whorl.  The other parts are called the spire.  The tip of the spire is called the apex, and the other end is called the base.  The shell has an opening called the aperture, and the animal comes out of this opening.\n\nThere are four ways to look at a shell: from the top (apical), from the bottom (basal), from the front (apertural), and from the back (abapertural).  Usually, people look at the shell from the front.\n\nTo count the turns of the shell, you look at it from the top and find the first line that divides the shell.  Then you draw a line and count the turns from there.  Each turn is divided into four parts.\n\nThe shell is like a path that the animal follows as it grows.  You can find the path by looking at the center of each turn and the size of the turn.  This path can be shown on a graph and mathematically explained.  Once you have the math, you can change the rules and see how the shell would grow differently.",
            "The number of babies and young children dying in Indonesia has not changed much in the last ten years.  The country is making progress in some areas, such as making sure people have clean water and sanitation.  However, the progress in health care for mothers and children is not fast enough to meet its goals by 2015. \n\nMany reasons are behind this problem.  We will look at these reasons and see that Indonesia needs to make its health system stronger instead of just focusing on special health programs.\n\nIndonesia has made some improvements.  More births are now attended by trained health workers.  But this number includes traditional workers like midwives who may not have the skills to help in emergency situations.  This means that many mothers are still dying from problems during delivery.  The health system still needs a lot of work.\n\nFewer children under five are getting medical help for diarrhea.  We do not have complete information about how well new mothers are being taken care of after childbirth.  But it is clear that this area needs more attention.\n\nFewer women are having cesarean sections than we would expect.  And the number of cesarean sections is very different between cities and rural areas.  This shows that people in cities have better access to healthcare.  The poor have a hard time getting medical help, often because they cannot afford it.\n\nTo improve health care for mothers and babies, the next question is: how can we best solve the problem of not having enough medical services?  Should Indonesia create special programs to help specific areas of health care, or should it focus on making its overall health system stronger?  We know that special programs can be helpful.  They have clear goals and can produce quick results.  But there are also some problems with this approach.  For example, when we give too much money to one area of health care, other areas may not get enough money or workers.  This can happen when we give a lot of money to one area and not enough to others.  We also have a problem with many programs working in the same area and not coordinating with each other.  This can make it hard for people to get the services they need.",
            "Two Victorian novels are different from others of their time. They are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These novels are not like other Victorian novels. They have mystery and strange things that happen. This makes the characters more interesting. It helps us understand their thoughts and feelings.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, strange things happen to Oliver. He sees things that are not real. These things show us what he is thinking and feeling. He has a lot of pain and fear.\n\nOne time, Oliver was shot. He remembers it like a dream. He does not have control over what happens to him. This makes him feel sad and helpless. He is not sure who is to blame for his problems. This shows that Oliver is not in control of his life.\n\nOliver is a victim of his circumstances. He has little power to change his life. Old Fagin is a bad influence on him. He makes Oliver feel defeated and helpless.\n\nThe story says: \"The day passed quickly. There was no day; it was gone as soon as it came. The night was long and quiet, but it did not last long.\"",
            "I worked with a group of students after school two years ago. I helped them with their schoolwork. I was good at helping them with English and reading. A teacher asked me to work with a boy named Adrian. He was having trouble reading. Some letters were easy for him, but others were hard. He spoke perfect English, but he was not sure about the alphabet. I thought something was strange.\n\nI met Adrian's mother when she came to pick him up. She did not speak much English. We spoke a little Spanish, but it was hard for me. Then I understood the problem. Adrian could read, but he did not know the English alphabet well. I hope he is doing better now.\n\nI tell this story to show that language can be a problem in school. Even if a child speaks good English, reading can still be hard. We all agree that this is a problem. So, what can we do? For Adrian, the answer was simple. He needed help with his alphabet and pronunciation. But for other children who do not speak much English, the answer is more complicated.\n\nWe need to try different things. We can use the dual language system. This means teaching children in two languages. We can also have special classes for children who need help with English. But one thing is not enough. We need to use all of these things together.\n\nThe dual language system is a good idea. It helps children learn two languages. This can make them smarter and do better in school. Some people are afraid of this idea. They think it is a waste of money and that only some children will benefit. But this is not true. If we use this system for all children, they will all benefit.\n\nSo, how do we do this? Do we need all teachers to speak two languages? No, that would be hard. But we can have special helpers who speak two languages. They can work with teachers to help children learn.",
            "Most people learn as children that there is something bigger than they are. We call this something \"God.\" Some people go to Sunday school to learn about God. Others visit the Temple or look inside themselves for answers. Many people accept the ideas about God that their parents teach them. But some people do not believe in God. They think there is no life after death. We choose our own way to think about God. We try to understand ourselves by looking at our own ideas. We want to find meaning in life.\n\nMy father liked cardinals. He said so when I asked him. We sat on our porch, listening to the rain. Our house was old, and the tin roof made a loud sound. My father looked out at the rain. He looked sad and worried. He was not eating well, and his clothes were loose. His hair was thinning. I was afraid to talk to him about how I felt. I was afraid it would make things worse. So I hugged him and sat with him in silence.\n\nMy father died in December. He was sick for a long time. The doctors gave him medicine to help him feel better, but it did not work. My birthday was five days before he died. I was sad and alone. I thought about God, but I did not want to talk to him. If God was real, I thought, he had stopped listening to me a long time ago.\n\nI did not want to watch my father die. So I did not. I wanted to remember him as he was, not as he was when he was sick. I knew my father better than anyone. He would not have wanted me to be sad. I stayed in my bed for three days, waiting to hear the news. But no one called me.",
            "The Gothic Novel is a mix of old and new ideas. It is like an oxymoron, as Ian Watt says in \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel.\" People have given the Gothic mode many different opinions. Some think it is not deep, while others praise it for creating a feeling of fear and awe. \n\nThe first Gothic Novel, \"The Castle of Otranto,\" was written by Horace Walpole. It used old and new ideas from romances to create a new way to write stories. Walpole took old theatrical ideas and combined them with new things from modern novels. He called it \"A Gothic Story.\" The Gothic genre uses many old ideas from medieval times, such as theater, architecture, and traditions.\n\nAt the time of \"The Castle of Otranto,\" the word \"gothic\" was used to describe many things, people, and time periods. People thought it was old-fashioned and not sophisticated compared to modern society and literature. The combination of old and new things in the Gothic genre is what made it last a long time and seem both old and new to readers.\n\nOne important idea in Gothic novels is chivalry. Chivalry is the idea of training a good knight. It is kept and changed in \"The Castle of Otranto.\" Chivalry is important because it represents the ideal of a brave, honorable, and competent knight. Gothic writers, like Walpole, wanted to show that this ideal was missing in their society. They used the chivalric ideas to make the past seem better and to suggest that people could be better. Walpole wrote \"The Castle of Otranto\" during a time of trouble in politics. He was unhappy with the future and thought that people had lost the good qualities of the past. He showed this in his character, Frederic, who is a prince, has suffered, and is supposed to be dead. He is like a gallant and courteous knight, but also exaggerated, which is a new idea in the Gothic genre.",
            "Supply chain management is the process of moving goods from making raw materials into finished products. This process includes getting a customer's order, making the raw materials into products, and delivering the products to the customer. The idea of supply chain management was first used in 1982 by a business expert named Keith Oliver. He said it is a way to plan, control, and carry out the steps in the supply chain to satisfy customers quickly and efficiently.\n\nThere are six important parts of a supply chain: making products, getting raw materials, storing products, finding the right place to make products, moving products, and sharing information. Business managers use these six parts to give the best service to customers.\n\nFirst, making products is the first step in the supply chain. It is the base of the whole process. When deciding what to make and how to make it, managers need to know what customers want. To find out what customers want, managers look at the market. The market is a good indicator of what customers need.\n\nOnce managers know what customers want, they can decide what products to make and how many to make. They must also decide where to make the products and which factory will work best. This decision is based on how many products to make and how good the products will be. The customer's needs and satisfaction are very important.\n\nAfter deciding where to make the products, managers focus on planning work and taking care of equipment. Making products is a very important step in the supply chain. Every detail is important, and if not done correctly, it can cost a lot of money and time in the long run. For example, companies like Wal-Mart and Target have a plan for every part of their business. They have a plan for how employees should dress and how to receive shipments from trucks. Having a plan helps companies work smoothly and avoid mistakes.\n\nThe second important part of supply chain management is getting raw materials. This means making strategic decisions to decide what a factory can do well and what should be done by other companies. A company may have different groups that make different parts of a product. The manager must decide which group is best for each part. Managers may also decide to work with other companies to make parts. This can help create efficiency and save money.",
            "A sign in Burma says Hitler is alive.\n\nEllen Page, a famous actress, holds a sign on a street corner. The sign says a strange thing: \"Hitler is alive.\" Burma is a country in Southeast Asia. A group of strong men, the military, controls the country. They took power in 1962 in a violent act. In 2007, people in the street began to protest. The protesters were led by Buddhist monks. They wore special red robes. The people's protests were called \"The Saffron Revolution.\" The government agreed to let the monks meet peacefully, but then the violence started. The military attacked the monks and destroyed their homes. Some news reporters were arrested and put in jail. One reporter from Japan was killed in September 2007. The government said 13 people died, but a colonel who left the army said many more people died.\n\nThis has happened before. Many governments want to control their people and stop them from protesting. This has been happening since ancient times. Long ago, some Roman leaders said they were gods and had complete control. Some Japanese leaders were thought to be gods. Today, the leader of the United States talks to a man who leads a group of people who do not agree with others.\n\nWe have seen many examples of this. In 1989, people in China protested against their government. Many people died. Some said 200-300 died, but others said 2,000-3,000 died. In the 1990s, a group of people in Rwanda killed many others. They were from a different group. Hitler's rule in Germany was another example. He and his men killed many Jewish people.",
            "Duke Ellington's influence on jazz is very big. He was able to create music for a long time, and this helped him to be creative. He made his orchestra sound very good. In many of his compositions, Ellington plays the piano quietly, but as a composer, he is very good at writing music that lets the band members show off their skills. He wrote the framework for the band to play freely, and he also wrote tightly planned pieces that used the special style of each band member to add musical ideas. This made the orchestra sound good together and created new and original music. Ellington knew the sound of each band member and how they fit together, and this helped him to write some of the most creative and wonderful jazz music in history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary says that Ellington's sound is special because he used the voice as a musical instrument. One good example of this is Creole Love Call. In this song, Ellington used the voice to add sound and color. He did not use lyrics, which made it easy to hear the music. This song also shows how Ellington liked to work with the style of each band member. It is a slow song with a repeated pattern of 12 bars. There are six parts to the song:\n\n1. The voice and reeds talk to each other, with the voice starting smooth and then getting rougher.\n2. A trumpet solo that makes the basic melody sound better and adds long, sad notes.\n3. A clarinet solo that is very high and has a special piano sound.\n4. The whole band repeats the first part, with the brass and reed sections talking to each other.\n5. The climax of the song, where the reeds talk to each other in a high voice, and the brass and rhythm sections play a special kind of music.\n6. The song goes back to the first part, with the voice and reeds talking to each other again. This time, the voice sounds like a special instrument.\n\nEllington liked to use the voice to add color to his music, and this is one of the things that makes his music special.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, Ellington uses his skill at planning the music and his ear for sound to create a special sound. He makes a call and response between a trumpet player named Bubber Miley and a singer named Baby Cox. They use the sound of Miley's playing and the singing of Cox to create a rich and good sound. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) uses these ideas, too. Ellington uses a trombone player named Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to introduce the melody in a special way.",

She decided she wanted a person, not just a thing. But she did not like any boys. Some boys had tried to attract her, but she was not interested. She wondered why she felt this way. She thought about it for many years. She had many ideas, but none of them seemed right.\n\nHer home was usually a peaceful place. Her parents were kind and calm. They did not argue with each other.

            "This study looked at food choices and their effect on heart disease and stroke. The study used a special diet called the \"Mediterranean Diet.\" This diet includes a lot of fruits, nuts, whole grains, and fish. It has less animal products and saturated fats. Drinking some alcohol is okay.\n\nPrevious studies showed that people who eat this diet are less likely to die from heart disease. Another study showed that this diet helps people lose weight and lower their bad cholesterol levels.\n\nThis study followed 74,886 women between 38 and 63 years old. They did not have heart disease or diabetes. The women answered a series of questions about what they ate every year from 1984 to 2004. The researchers looked at the answers to see if the women who ate the Mediterranean Diet were less likely to get heart disease or have a stroke.\n\nThe researchers used a special number to measure how well the women ate the Mediterranean Diet. They looked at the number of heart disease and stroke cases over 20 years. They also looked at the number of deaths from heart disease and stroke.\n\nThe study found that women who ate a lot of the Mediterranean foods were less likely to get heart disease and stroke. In fact, they were 29% less likely to get heart disease and 29% less likely to have a stroke.",
            "The United States had a big financial problem in 2007. Many people lost their jobs, the housing market fell, and some big companies failed. This problem is still happening today. We need to understand how this problem started and how to stop it. The financial problem was caused by bad decisions made by the government. They made banks and companies make loans to people who could not pay them back. This was a big mistake because the country's financial system was not strong enough. Two companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were forced to buy and sell these bad loans. When people could not pay back these loans, the banks did not have enough money. They sold these bad loans to other people, which made the problem worse.\n\nThis problem started many years ago, in 1999. The President wanted to win another term in office. He made a rule to make it easier for people to get loans to buy houses. This rule helped create the problem that happened seven years later. In 1999, the New York Times reported, \"Fannie Mae wants to help people with low income get loans to buy houses.\" But the reporter warned, \"This could be a problem if the economy gets worse.\" He was right. The government helped Fannie Mae, but it made a big mistake.\n\nMany things made the economy worse. Banks made new kinds of loans that were not good. They were called adjustable-rate mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. These loans made the economy more connected to the housing market. Many people and companies borrowed too much money to buy houses. They were not ready for a problem in the housing market. When the housing market fell, many people and companies failed.\n\nThe five biggest investment banks in the United States had $4.1 trillion in bad loans in 2007. This was 30% of the country's money. Some big banks like Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers failed. Others like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to become regular banks with strict rules. Fannie and Freddie had $5 trillion in bad loans and were taken over by the government in 2008.",
            "Exposition is a part of writing that can be tricky.  It's the place in your story where you explain a lot about the characters and the world they live in. But too much exposition can be boring.\n\nYou know, \"show, don't tell\" is a basic writing rule. But even with that in mind, it's easy to fall into the trap of writing too much exposition. This can happen when you want to tell the reader too much about your characters and their world.\n\nLet's look at an example. Imagine you are reading a story and you are told that the main character met her husband at a certain time and place, and they got married in a big ceremony. But then you are told even more - that he was murdered in front of her. This can take up a lot of space in the story, and it's not very exciting.\n\nA better approach is to show this part of the story instead of just telling it. For example, you could show how much the husband loves his wife through his actions and words. You could also show how much his presence in her life changed her, by showing how she thinks and feels about him. This would make the reader care about him and be sad when he dies.\n\nThe key is to add details that make your story come alive. Instead of just saying \"They met, they married, he died,\" you could make the reader feel like they are a part of the story. This will keep them interested and engaged.\n\nAs a writer, you need to balance telling the reader what's happening with showing them. It's easy to get carried away with exposition, but it's better to give the reader a taste of the story and let them fill in the rest with their imagination.",
            "I watched two television news programs from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was on NBC 4 this morning. The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who hurt his wife very badly. His name is Shad Hostettler. The police arrested him. The news program showed his picture. He looked very bad. They talked about this story for two minutes because it was still happening. I think they used the right amount of time for this story.\n\nThe second story was about a young man named Travis Buyers. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area. He was 18 years old and very sick from his injury. The police were looking for the person who did this, but they did not know who it was. I noticed that this story was short. I think this might be because the man who was shot is black. I have seen this happen many times before. When a white person is hurt or missing, the news spends a lot of time on it. But when a black person is hurt or missing, the news does not talk about it as much.\n\nThe next story was about a helicopter that was shot. The police found a hole in it and think it was shot with a .22 caliber rifle. The police are offering a reward for information that can help them catch the person who did this.\n\nThe next story was about the weather. It will be hot and rainy on Saturday. The temperature will be in the mid 80s. They wanted to keep us watching, so they made it a short story.\n\nThey also talked about a store that was robbed. A black man took money from the store. He was wearing a dark hoodie and was about six feet tall and 150 pounds. They spent a lot of time talking about how black he was.\n\nAnother story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez. He was a big dealer of marijuana. He was caught and will be in prison for 25 years. They said he was Hispanic, but I do not think that was important to the story.",
            "There is a strong connection between brothers. This connection is very strong and cannot be broken. Inside this connection are many feelings: love, pride, jealousy, and anger. Brothers know each other very well. They can see themselves in their brother. When a bad situation happens, the true nature of this connection is clear. This connection can bring both good and bad things. When we understand the feelings that come from this connection, we must accept the results of these feelings. When we look at our brother, we see our own self. We see how others do not see us, but how we really are. Our actions and the results of these actions show our true character.\n\nIn the story \"The Scarlet Ibis\", two brothers show this connection and the strong emotions that come with it. The story takes place in a beautiful and vivid place. The two boys go on a difficult journey. Disappointment and pride are very strong in one scene. Only one brother survives. The story shows this connection through the main character, Doodle, and the way he interacts with his brother. The writer also tells us about the feelings of the main character and his view of the world. These feelings affect his actions.\n\nThe main character feels one main emotion: pride. He was angry at his brother Doodle from the beginning. He wanted a brother to teach and play with. He wanted someone to go on adventures with. But Doodle was very sick. He could not do the things the main character wanted. The main character was very sad and angry when he realized this. In fact, he even thought about hurting Doodle. But when Doodle smiled at him, he felt love for his brother. This shows that he really did love Doodle.",
            "The human brain is a very complicated and creative system that helps us process information. The way we talk about the brain has changed as technology has improved. At first, people compared the brain to a piece of wax, then to a piece of paper, then to a book, and now to a computer. But these comparisons are not perfect and can lead to misunderstandings.\n\nThe brain processes information in a very special way. First, it takes in information from our senses. Our senses are like special tools that help us feel, see, hear, touch, or taste things. The brain takes this information and changes it into signals that it can understand.\n\nThe brain uses two ways to process information. One way is to start with small pieces of information and put them together to understand something new. This is like building a puzzle. For example, when you look at a picture of a black box, you start by seeing the colors and the lines. Then, your brain puts these pieces together to understand that you are looking at a box.\n\nThe other way is to use information that you already know to help you understand something new. This is like using a map to find your way. If you see a picture of a black box, your brain might use what it already knows about boxes to help you understand what you are looking at.\n\nThe brain also has a special filter that decides what information is important and what you should pay attention to. For example, when you look at the grass, your brain does not notice each individual blade. But if someone calls your name, you hear it clearly.\n\nInformation in the brain is stored in three kinds of memory: short-term, working, and long-term. Short-term memory stores information for a short time, like 20 seconds. Working memory is like a computer that stores information while it is being used. Long-term memory stores information for a long time.\n\nThe brain processes and stores information in different ways. Some scientists study how people remember things, while others study how computers work, or how the brain itself works. One way to understand how the brain works is to think of it like a network of connections. These connections help us understand how we remember things. For example, if you think of a chair, your brain might connect it to other things like a table or wood.",
            "Aldous Huxley writes a book called Brave New World. It is a story about a future world where people value being happy more than anything else. They are taught from a young age to be happy and not to think deeply about anything. The people in this world are not in charge. A group called the World Controller decides what is best for them. Huxley thinks this is a bad system.\n\nHe uses ideas from a man named Karl Marx to show how this system is not good. Marx said that when people work for a company, they do not have control over their lives. They work only for a salary. Huxley's book says the same thing. The people in the story do not think about how they are treated. They are happy to buy things and enjoy themselves.\n\nHuxley is also saying that this system makes people not think for themselves. They are controlled by the World Controller. The people in the story are like pawns in a game. They do not have any power. They are only happy to do what they are told.\n\nIn the story, there are different classes of people. The classes are like groups. Some people are more powerful than others. But the people in the lower classes do not know they are not in control. They are happy to be like everyone else. Some people are born with more power than others. But they do not use their power to help others.\n\nHuxley is saying that this system is not good. People should be able to think for themselves and make their own choices. They should not be controlled by someone else. In the story, people do not have deep relationships. They do not love each other. They only care about how they look and what they own.\n\nThe people in the story are happy to do what they are told. They do not question anything. This is like what Marx said about people who work for a company. They do not have control over their lives. They are only happy to get a paycheck.\n\nHuxley's book is a warning about the dangers of this system. He thinks it is not good for people. We should be able to think for ourselves and make our own choices.",
            "I am a student at University Park. I have been here for two and a half years. It can be hard to get around the campus. My freshman year, I was in a dorm room in East Halls, near the end of campus. I had to walk a long way to get to classes in the Willard building, near the center of campus. This walk could take 25 minutes, especially in bad weather. I talked to an old friend. He said he stopped riding a bike for a few years, but now he rides one again. He said, \"Bikes are great. They are the best way to get around.\" Riding a bike is good for your body. It is also the best way to travel. If you eat breakfast and ride a bike, you can go 30 miles or more. I live off campus now. I decided to buy a bike. It was a good decision. I ride my bike to class every day. I have a class in Thomas building. It is a 25-minute walk from my home. But if I ride my bike, it takes only 5 minutes. The road to Thomas building is not always easy to ride on. But I need my bike. If I didn't have one, I would have to walk. Walking would take an extra 30-40 minutes every day. This is two and a half hours every week. I am too busy to walk. I need my bike to get to class on time."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",

Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "I want to study social work. My goal is to help children who have been hurt or ignored. I also want to help families who are having problems. I want to learn more about how to be a good social worker. I want to be able to help people, and I want to be good at my job.\n\nI believe in some important values. These values are: help others, respect people, do the right thing, and be good at what I do. These values are important for social workers. They are also important to me.\n\nI have always wanted to help people. But I was not sure what job to do. In high school and college, I saw people running away from their problems. Some people did not use good ways to deal with their problems. Because of what I saw, I decided to study psychology. I got my degree in 2009 from Piedmont College. After I graduated, I was still not sure about my career. One day, a friend introduced me to a 16-year-old boy. He was very nervous. He was visiting because he was being hurt by his parents. The next day, he called the police. I went to talk to his parents. They were being dishonest about what was happening. They said their son was being manipulative. I realized that I wanted to help children like him.\n\nAnother important value for social workers is fairness. We say that every person is important, but we do not always act that way. We mourn when someone dies, but we do not want to be different from others. I do not want to be like everyone else. I believe in fairness and I will fight against injustice. In high school and college, I spoke out against unfairness. I wore clothes that showed who I was, I colored my hair in different colors, and I spoke out against racism and unfair treatment. I will continue to fight for what is right.",
            "This paper looks at the biological and sociocultural models of insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetics and health problems. The sociocultural model looks at how the environment affects people.\n\nThe biological model examines genetic information and health problems that can cause insomnia. The sociocultural model looks at how people's environments, such as their race, age, and income, affect their sleep.\n\nWe will look at some research on insomnia. This research will explain the different parts of the biological and sociocultural models. Then, we will talk about the strengths and weaknesses of each study.\n\nInsomnia is a sleep problem. It can be caused by different things. Sometimes, it is a sleep problem by itself. Other times, it is a problem connected to another mental health issue. There are several kinds of sleep problems. They can be caused by medical problems or by taking certain medicines.\n\nThere are two kinds of sleep problems. One kind is called Dyssonmias. The other kind is called Parasomnias. Dyssonmias are problems with falling asleep or staying asleep. Parasomnias are problems with acting out or moving while asleep.\n\nThe biological model says that genetics and health problems can cause insomnia. Our brains have special cells that help us sleep. These cells are in the part of the brain called the hypothalamus. These cells contain a substance that helps us sleep. If these cells do not work correctly, we may have trouble sleeping.\n\nOne study looked at mice and found that a special receptor in the brain helps us sleep. This receptor is called the GABAB receptor. If this receptor is not working correctly, we may have trouble sleeping. The study found that a medicine can help people sleep by affecting this receptor.\n\nThe sociocultural model says that our environment affects our sleep. If we have a family history of insomnia, we may be more likely to have insomnia. If we are under a lot of stress, we may have trouble sleeping.\n\nThis study shows that genetics and the environment can affect our sleep. It also shows that we may be able to cure insomnia by using medicine that affects the GABAB receptor.",
            "This paper is about Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). CAPD is a problem with the brain. It is not a hearing problem. People with CAPD can hear sounds, but their brain has trouble understanding what they hear.\n\nThe brain helps us understand what we hear. It separates sounds and helps us know what someone is saying. People with CAPD have trouble with this part of the brain. It is called the central nervous system (CNS).\n\nCAPD was first talked about in the 1950s. Researchers studied children with speech problems. They made tests to help diagnose the problem. In 1954, a team of researchers in Italy started working on these tests. In 1961, another researcher came up with a way to test how the brain works when it hears two sounds at the same time.\n\nCAPD can cause problems with hearing. A person with CAPD may not know where a sound is coming from. They may have trouble hearing two or more sounds. They may not understand speech patterns. They may not know when someone is being serious or not. They may not be able to block out background noise. They may not be able to make sense of what they hear.\n\nTo find out if someone has CAPD, doctors use tests. These tests look at how the person hears and responds to sounds. There are many types of tests. Doctors may ask questions or watch how the person behaves. There is no single test that can diagnose CAPD. Tests may include listening to many sounds and then trying to pick out certain words or numbers.\n\nTeachers can help students with CAPD in a regular classroom. They can make sure the student sits in a quiet place. They can ask the student to repeat what they hear. They can break down instructions into simple steps. They can use visual aids to help the student understand.",
            "The play Twelfth Night says that using a fake identity can be helpful in hiding the truth, but it can also cause problems. If you continue to lie, you may forget who you really are. In the play, the main problem with ending a lie is that you may hurt the people around you.\n\nThe play talks about a man pretending to be a woman. This is a big problem because it makes us wonder why the character in the play wants to hide who they are. In the play, a woman named Viola pretends to be a man to protect herself. This works, but it also makes her friends and family unhappy.\n\nViola is very good at pretending to be a man. She is so good that another woman in the play, Olivia, falls in love with her. Viola also has feelings for a man in the play, but she is pretending to be a man so she can't express her true feelings.\n\nThe play may be saying that lying can help people see their true feelings. Some characters in the play may have feelings they don't want to admit. They see the person pretending to be someone else and that makes them think about their own feelings. For example, a woman in the play falls in love with a man who is pretending to be a woman. But she quickly falls in love with a real man who looks like the person she fell in love with. This makes us wonder if she really liked the person pretending to be a woman or if she just liked the look of them.\n\nThe play is showing us that people may judge others based on how they look. The woman in the play who falls in love with the person pretending to be a woman quickly forgets about them when the real man appears. This makes us think about how people may be quick to judge others based on looks rather than who they really are.",
            "The German colonial rule was very cruel. It killed many people, especially the Ovaherero and Nama in South West Africa. But the German colonial rule was not the same everywhere. The policies and way of ruling were different in different places. The German colonies were very different from each other.\n\nThe colonies with educated Africans were in East Africa. The British took over this area in 1919. They found many Africans who could read and write. German education in Kamerun and other colonies was also very good.\n\nBut South West Africa was different. The government did not help Africans much with education. Only a few organizations that were not the government helped Africans learn. The government spent more money on schools for Europeans. The government also controlled the schools for Europeans. This made a big difference in South West Africa. Many Africans did not go to school and could not read or write.\n\nOther German colonies had many educated Africans. But in South West Africa, most people were not educated. This was because of many reasons. We will talk about these reasons in this paper. We will also look at how European settlers and the government felt about Africans.\n\nThere are many books and studies about education in German colonies. Most of these were written in German a long time ago. Later, people wrote about education in different colonies and how it was the same or different. One person, Cohen, studied education in South West Africa and East Africa. He said that the number of European settlers in South West Africa was a main reason for the difference in education.\n\nSouth West Africa was a place with a good climate. Many Europeans lived there because it was not too hot. In 1913, 15,000 Europeans lived in South West Africa. This was more than in any other German colony except East Africa.",
            "Heavy metal music is a big group of music styles. It has grown a lot over the past 100 years. Many subgroups of heavy metal have developed. Some of these subgroups have smaller subgroups. This makes it hard to list all kinds of heavy metal music.\n\nHeavy metal music started out a long time ago. But over the years, it has changed a lot. People started to make their own types of heavy metal music. This led to many new kinds of heavy metal. Today, there are many different kinds of heavy metal.\n\nSo, what is heavy metal music? Heavy metal music is known for being loud and dark. It often has strong beats and strong guitar sounds. Many people in heavy metal bands are very good at playing their instruments. They put a lot of feeling into their music.\n\nHeavy metal music is also connected to the use of drugs. In the 1970s, many people used drugs to create their music. This led to some strange and unusual sounds. Some people say that the use of drugs helped create the dark and crazy sound that is typical of heavy metal music.\n\nMany heavy metal songs have lyrics that are about dark and sad things. These lyrics reflect the darker side of life. One of the first heavy metal songs was \"Helter Skelter.\" It was written by the Beatles and is about the ups and downs of life. It was a response to a song by the Rolling Stones. The Beatles wanted to show that they could make music that was just as heavy and dark as the Stones.",
            "Henri Rousseau was a famous painter. He painted a picture called The Dream in 1910. This painting shows a woman who is very happy in a dream world. But The Dream is more than just a picture. It shows Rousseau's own dreams and goals as a painter. He wanted to be recognized and liked by other artists and people who love art.\n\nRousseau had a hard time achieving his goal. He had to decide if he should paint like other artists or be different. He wanted to fit in with the art world, but he also wanted to be himself.\n\nTo understand The Dream, we need to know something about Rousseau's life. He was born in a town in northwest France in 1844. His father was a hardware dealer and had a good job. Rousseau grew up without learning art. He worked for the government until he was 40 years old. People called him a customs inspector, but he was really a gabelou.\n\nRousseau's first wife died when their eight children were young. He was left with a daughter and a lot of sadness. He started painting to feel better and find a new life. Unlike other artists who painted about the poor, Rousseau painted about everyday people like himself.\n\nRousseau wanted to be accepted by the art world. He was older than many other artists, and they were famous already. But he didn't get recognition until the same time that another artist, Matisse, was becoming famous. They were different because Matisse wanted to paint in a new way, but Rousseau wanted to paint in a way that was accepted by the art world.",
            "We know that many great thinkers believe there is a strong connection between ethics and beauty, between what is true and what is good. I agree with this idea. The poet John Keats said, \"Beauty is truth. Truth is beauty. That is all you need to know.\" We learn many things in life through education and experience, but we also feel that ethics and aesthetics are special. They are not just rules or laws. Our studies of morality and beauty try to explain why something is beautiful or why an action is right. But we cannot fully explain these things. When we talk about a great work of art or literature, we can talk about its details, but we often can't fully explain why it is so good.\n\nFor example, we can discuss the details of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, but we can't fully describe what makes it beautiful. When we talk about our favorite work of art or literature, we often say things like, \"There is just something about it.\" This \"something\" is hard to explain. I believe that both art and morality have this quality. As the writer Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that cannot be said in any other way.\" We can describe the details of a story, but there is something more to it.\n\nI think that ethics and aesthetics are connected because they work in the same way. We experience them at a deep level, but we can't fully explain them. This connection is even stronger with literature. Literature is special because it deals with values. Literature helps us understand what is important in life. The writer McKean said, \"What makes literature special is its moral quality. Literature is important to us because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany is a strong country today. It is a united country with a mix of cultures. You can feel this mix in many places in Germany. From München, near the Alps, to Kiel, a city by the Baltic Sea. You can also feel it in Köln, on the river Rhine, and in Dresden, on the Elbe River.\n\nGermany has a unique culture. But it comes from many different places. Many different tribes lived in Germany long ago. The country is called Germania. Scholars and historians do not agree on where the name came from. Some think it came from a group of people called the Tungrians.\n\nA long time ago, a Roman leader named Julius Caesar wrote about the people of Germania. He used the word \"Germanus\" to describe them. He got this word from the Gauls, a group of people he fought against. Caesar used the word to show the difference between the Gauls and the people he had not yet defeated.\n\nSome people think the word \"German\" comes from a spear called a \"ger\". Others think it comes from an old Irish word \"garim\", which means \"to shout\". This might mean that the Germans were loud.\n\nA Roman historian named Tacitus wrote about the origins of the Germans. He said that the Germans were an old group of people who did not mix with other groups. They lived in a rough country with bad weather and were not easy to live with. Not many people from Rome wanted to live in Germany.\n\nThe Romans would sometimes send armies to Germany to get goods. But they usually went back to Rome. The Germanic tribes lived on the edge of the Roman Empire. They traded with the Romans and served in the Roman army.",
            "I looked down at the toilet in front of me. My mind was empty. I did not think about the toilet or what I was seeing. I just looked. My brain was like a tool that worked by itself. It took in what I was seeing, but did not think about it.\n\nI had always wanted to draw. When I was six years old, I started to think about drawing. Later, I found a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" It teaches people to draw. One thing it says to do is to put a square around the thing you want to draw. This makes it easier to see.\n\nI could not do that with the toilet in front of me. It was too much. I was amazed. Many artists have their own way of seeing things. Picasso liked blue. Monet liked green. The old masters used all the colors. If I wanted to be a good artist, I had to start by looking at this brown thing in front of me.\n\nMy hand moved to the toilet handle. I pulled it down. But the brown thing did not move. I pulled it down again. It still did not move.\n\nI grabbed a mop and stood in front of the toilet. I was not happy. Someone had left a messy present for the toilet cleaners at Rite Aid. I used the mop to try and get the brown thing out of the toilet. I used the toilet paper to make my hand warm and protected. Then I slowly put my hand in the toilet bowl. It was like putting a turkey in the oven for Thanksgiving.",
            "More and more teenagers are dying in car accidents.  Several reasons work together to cause this problem.  One reason is that the young brain is not ready for the dangers of driving.  The young brain is not experienced.  This lack of experience causes many deaths.  It also causes many accidents, such as turning over, speeding, and driving off the road.\n\nTeenagers are also more likely to have accidents when they drive with their friends.  A study in California found that the number of car accidents increases with the age of the passenger.\n\nSome states, including California, have made a rule for teenagers who are learning to drive.  These rules say that teenagers can only drive for a few hours a day and cannot drive with friends who are also teenagers.  But I think these rules are not enough.  The real problem is that young drivers are not good at handling the dangers of driving.\n\nA psychologist named Marvin Zuckerman says that people under 20 years old are not ready to drive.  He has studied how young people like to take risks.  This makes sense.  If we give driver's licenses to young teenagers, many more people will be hurt or killed in car accidents.  In a few years, the number of deaths will be very high.  Many more teenagers will be able to drive soon.\n\nIf we want to keep our teenagers safe, we need to make a rule that says no one under 18 can drive a car.  Schools can still teach teenagers how to drive.  But teenagers must wait until they are 18 to get a driver's license.  We can still give teenagers a special permit that allows them to practice driving with an adult.  They must practice for a certain number of hours before they can take a test to get a driver's license.\n\nThis is not a new idea.  Many states already have rules like this.  We can make a rule that is the same for all states.  This will help keep our teenagers safe.",
            "I looked at films from the Library of Congress. I chose to watch trick films from 1895 to 1901. There were 15 of these films. They trick the eye with creative editing. My study of these films looked at their artistic side and how they changed over time. \n\nMost of these films stay in one place and do not move. The camera does not move. The films are long and use many shots to create an illusion. \n\nOne thing trick films have in common is they are shot in a fixed place. The camera does not move to follow people or objects. This style came from theater and magic shows. In these films, people move side to side. They do not move towards or away from the camera. \n\nMost trick films are long shots or medium shots. They are not close-ups. This is like theater, where the audience sees the whole performance. Actors do not move towards the camera. \n\nMost trick films are short, usually less than a minute. They are like magic tricks. They do tricks, like making things disappear or change. One trick film shot does not always mean one physical shot. It might be many shots joined together to make an illusion. \n\nOne early trick film is The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots. At first, it looks like one shot. But if you look closely, you can see when the camera shot of Mary's fake head starts. The whole film looks like one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a strong supporter of Republican ideas. He was a farmer, but his work and short time in politics made him known for caring about personal freedom and government. He believed that farming was the best way of life, and this idea guided his thoughts on the government. He wanted to protect and support farmers, which influenced his views on power, laws, and the justice system.\n\nJohn Taylor thought the United States had a great chance to create a perfect system of government. There was no old tradition to follow, so the country's founders could create a system that worked for everyone. He believed in the natural rights of people, which are basic rights that everyone has. He thought that if one person does not have these rights, others will suffer too. These rights should not be controlled by the government.\n\nTaylor believed that in a society, some people might use their strength and cleverness to get what they want. But in a country, this should not be the way things work. To create a good society, the government should understand that people have good and bad qualities. Taylor thought that a government should protect private property, help farmers, and prevent people from getting too much power. He believed that a government like this would work well no matter who was in charge.\n\nTaylor also believed that people are motivated by self-interest, but this is only bad if it means hurting others. He thought a good government should control people's bad qualities and watch out for bad principles that can harm society. A good government would keep people from being cruel to each other.\n\nTaylor wanted the government to limit its power, as stated in the Constitution. He thought a big government was expensive and could be unfair. However, he also believed that following the Constitution too strictly could lead to problems. He thought the Declaration of Independence was more important because it said the United States was a group of independent states, not just one country.",
            "We look at Figure 17. There was a big drop in commuter log entries in the third month of the project. This was not good news. We do not know why this happened. It is possible that the drop in people walking or biking because of winter weather is partly to blame. In New England, people often need to walk or bike less in winter. In December, students and teachers are busy finishing schoolwork and getting grades. They may not have time to fill out the commuter log. This month also starts the holiday season. Many people do not need to go to school for a month. Classes will start again in late January. But we do not understand why people were not filling out the log in February. Maybe people have less energy at the beginning of a project like this. We tried to solve this problem by creating the Carpool Challenge Week. This was a special effort to get people excited about the project again. It worked and we got more log entries in March. So, we need to find a way to keep people interested in the project. We also need to fight against people's love of driving their cars. This is a big problem in our culture. We tried to solve this by offering prizes like gift cards. We gave these out at local restaurants, coffee shops, and stores. We thought this would help people change their behavior. But it would have been interesting to see if bigger prizes would help even more. For example, we could have given away a bike, a hybrid car, or an electric car. This could have helped people be more interested in the project. The prizes we offered did not change during the project. If we had offered bigger prizes in December and January, it might have helped people be more interested.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that follows a group of stocks or a commodity.  It is like an index fund but is more flexible and can be bought and sold on an exchange like a stock.  ETFs give you the benefits of many stocks and the ability to buy and sell easily.  They have low costs, but you must pay a commission to buy or sell them.  Many ETFs are available.  Before buying an ETF, it is a good idea to look at its benefits and see if they are real.\n\nWe will look at the ETF IHF.  This ETF has ten main stocks that make up 63.58% of all its assets.  We will compare the returns and risks of these ten stocks to the ETF as a whole.  If we use the same amounts of these ten stocks together, we can see how well they represent the ETF.\n\nOur calculations show that these ten stocks could give a 16% higher return than the ETF.  They also have less risk.  But we need to know if these results are real or just a chance.  To do this, we will look at the risk of each stock and see how much it adds to the overall risk of the portfolio.\n\nWe will examine the standard deviation of each stock to see if the portfolio of ten stocks is truly less risky than the ETF.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe says \"Dream-Land\" is one of his best poems. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe uses the word \"Thulé.\" He got this word from a famous writer named Virgil. Virgil used \"Thulé\" to describe an island north of Britain. This island was the edge of the known world for the Greeks.\n\nPoe was interested in German writers. One of them is Goethe. Poe liked Goethe's writing. In fact, some people think Poe copied some of Goethe's ideas. A man named Karl J. Arndt wrote a book about this. He said Poe's poem \"Politian\" is similar to Goethe's poem \"Mignon.\"\n\nGoethe was a well-known writer of a play called \"Faust.\" This play was published in two parts. The first part was released in 1808, and the second part was released in 1832 when Goethe died. Inside \"Faust,\" there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem is about a king who loses his wife. After she dies, he drinks a lot and cries. He then decides to die too. Before he dies, he gives his money and things to his children. The only thing he keeps is a special cup his wife gave him. He goes to a cliff, throws the cup into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The king in \"The King of Thulé\" and the king in Poe's \"Dream-Land\" are very similar. They both have a sad story about loss.\n\nPoe mentions Thulé twice in his writings. He says \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" but he uses \"Thulé\" twice in \"Dream-Land.\" \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" are like two poems that go together. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker says he is in a place called Thulé. He describes Thulé as a dark and lonely place. He sees dead friends and a world without color. This is similar to \"The King of Thule\" by Goethe. In \"The King of Thule,\" the king is also lonely and has lost his wife. He has lost his will to live.\n\nGoethe was a famous writer that Poe liked. Poe respected another writer named Tennyson. Poe admired Tennyson's work. Poe would have known Goethe's work because of Tennyson. Poe also saw many reproductions of Goethe's writing after it was first published.",
            "In California, a customer who gets hurt after slipping and falling on a spill in a store can ask for extra money from the store. This money is called punitive damages. But to get it, the customer must prove that the store manager acted with mean intention. \n\nImagine a customer slipped and fell on applesauce in a store. The store manager knew about the spill twice, but he did not clean it for 30 minutes because he was eating dinner. A judge is not likely to throw out the customer's claim for extra money. The customer must show that the manager knew his actions could cause harm and he did not care. \n\nThere was a problem with spills in the store before. Many customers had slipped and fallen. The manager knew about this. But he did nothing to fix the problem. This is why the customer is asking for extra money. The customer will say that the manager was mean and did not care about the harm he could cause.\n\nA manager at the store found out about the spill twice. He said he was busy eating dinner and did not have time to clean it. But he did not clean it for 30 minutes. The customer slipped and fell and got hurt. Before this, five other customers had slipped and fallen in the store. The customer is suing the store for money to pay for her injury and to punish the store for its actions.\n\nIn California, a customer can ask for extra money if the store manager acted with mean intention.

            "Four years ago, I took a course in Islam at CBC.  We discussed whether Islam is a hostile religion.  Now this question is more important than ever.  I have seen how the media changed its view of Islam.  After 9/11, the media was against Islam.  Now it is very tolerant.  I think it is interesting that in 2001, a presidential candidate like Barack Obama could come to power.  He has Muslim family members.\n\nI am interested in the story of the Prophet Muhammad.  What I learned about him did not match his biography.  I thought he forced people to become Muslims.  He took over tribes and made them join Islam.  But his biography says he was a humble person who was often misunderstood.  People came to him because they believed in his teachings.\n\nThere are many similarities between Muhammad's life and the life of Jesus.  One example is when Muhammad had very little food and made it multiply so that many people could eat.  This kind of writing makes me think the authors wanted Muhammad to look like a humble prophet who did not need to prove anything.  He just lived a truthful life with miracles.  I think this is a problem because it makes Jesus' life and teachings seem less important.\n\nI do not like the way the biography presents stories.  Many of the stories come from people who heard from others.  This makes the stories seem suspicious.  I think the authors wanted to show that people converted to Islam on their own.  But I do not think this is true.\n\nWhat worries me most is that the biography tries to make Muhammad look like a good and humble person.  But history says he was not like that.  I wonder if Muslims today know the truth about Muhammad's past.",
            "We can see a change in Christian thought since Jesus' time.  People did not follow his teachings after he died.  A new path was chosen.  If we look at history, we can see a pattern.  Christians moved away from what Jesus believed.  Today, we see many people are more open-minded.  They want to know more about the past.  Traditional people will still exist, but they will not be the only ones.  Many Christians will learn more about Jesus' life and teachings.  They will want to know the original ideas of the Christian religion.  It may take time, but the result will be clear:  Christians will go back to the beginning.  They will remove ideas that were added later.  They will go back to what Jesus said.  It will be like a clock moving backward.  Only the true ideas of Jesus will remain.\n\nIn the United States and Europe, people will follow Jesus' ideas more closely.  They will worship like he taught.  The church will still be strong, but it will be simpler.  People will follow the same ideas everywhere.  We will see less difference between different Christian groups.  History shows us that this can happen.  Christians were once treated badly by the Roman Empire.  But later the empire became Christian.  Our country went from being against African-American rights to having African-American leaders.  The same thing will happen with Christianity.  People will go back to the source.  They will see that Jesus' words are not always meant to be taken literally.\n\nLooking back in history, we see that Christianity started with Judaism.  The Jewish people had many different groups.  They had Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and many common people.  They did not agree on everything.  By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., the Jewish people believed in one God.  They believed in the Bible and its teachings.  But they were not the same.  They had different ideas.",
            "The Jungle shows that people are naturally selfish and only care about themselves. They want to make their lives better, but they do not care about others who are less powerful. The book shows this in many ways. The factory owners and managers are an example. They want to make their factories big and strong. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way. They do not care about the pollution that harms people and animals. They also do not care about their workers. They work the workers very hard and pay them little.\n\nThe workers have no rights. They can work long hours and then lose their jobs without warning. There were no laws to protect the workers in that time. The factory owners and managers were like slave drivers. They treated the workers very badly and had no sympathy for them. The workers were like slaves and had no way to escape their hard lives. They were very poor and had to live in bad conditions.\n\nThe book shows that people are naturally selfish. The factory owners and managers show this.

            "Many writers use different ways to make readers feel a certain way about important subjects. \nF. Scott Fitzgerald uses these techniques in his book The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, he pairs a word with another word that do not usually fit together to create a certain feeling. Other times, he gives meaning to a symbol and uses it for the same purpose. \n\nFitzgerald uses the last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white, gray, and red. He builds meaning for these colors and then uses it to show readers a feeling about an important thing. \n\nFitzgerald creates meaning for white and gray. He thinks white is better and more upper class, and gray is older and faded. He shows this in the beginning of the book by using these colors many times. \n\nDaisy and Jordan are always wearing white. Everyone wears white at Gatsby's party. Nick wears white clothes, Tom wears a white shirt, and Catherine looks very white. The only time people are not wearing white is when Nick describes Gatsby's party and sees many bright colors. Fitzgerald also uses white and gray to describe ordinary things. \n\nAs Nick goes to work, he goes down a white valley in New York. The names of people at Gatsby's party are gray on Nick's list. Catherine's apartment is like a long white cake. He also describes ordinary people and places as white or gray. Jordan and Daisy have a white childhood, there are gray cars and land in a sad place, an Italian child is gray, and a dog-seller is an old gray man.\n\nAfter Fitzgerald gives meaning to white and gray, he uses them to show readers that something is not important or is the same. He uses this technique with Daisy first. After a long time, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as a woman in white. Readers start to see Daisy as not a person, but as something Gatsby wants. \n\nFitzgerald uses this technique many times with Daisy to show that she is not special. For example, there is a gray fog on Daisy's fur, and she wears a white dress before Tom and Gatsby meet.",
            "San Diego County is a great place for growing food. The climate is good and the sun shines a lot. Farmers grow many things here, including tomatoes, oranges, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, and honey. People want to eat food grown without chemicals, and many organizations in San Diego have long waiting lists. Many farmers also sell organic eggs and milk.\n\nSome farms in the area allow visitors to walk around and see how they grow their food. Farmers can earn money by giving tours and offering hiking and birdwatching. This can also help the environment. The government gives money to farmers who grow food without chemicals, and this can help protect the land and wildlife.\n\nBut farming without chemicals can be harder and more expensive. Farmers must work harder and spend more time removing pests and weeds and fertilizing the soil without using chemicals. They can also lose more food than farmers who use chemicals. Small farms are less efficient than big farms because they do not have as much land. They must also spend more time and money on things that help the environment, such as planting special crops and removing invasive plants.\n\nThe land I chose is in a place called Potrero, California. It is 160 acres of land with different types of plants and trees. Many species of plants and animals live here, including some that are endangered. The government is making a plan to protect this area and the animals that live here.\n\nPeople lived on this land for a long time before it was used for farming. It was used to raise cattle and sell wood. Now, I want to show how a farmer could grow food here and protect the environment at the same time.\n\nI found a real farm in the area and used it as an example of what a farmer could do. The farm is in the same climate and has the same types of plants and animals. The farmer can get help from the government and make money by giving tours and selling organic food.",
            "Culture is very important in any negotiation. To understand culture, we must know what it is not and what it means. Culture is not the same everywhere. It is not a single or uniform thing. Making general statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" is not helpful. It is better to learn about a culture and how it will affect the negotiation.\n\nWhen we meet a new culture, we can compare it to our own culture. We can learn about its history and its problems. Instead of judging or trying to change a culture, we should accept it and work within its rules. This is especially true if we are in a weaker position in the negotiation.\n\nCulture is not just about countries. Companies also have their own culture. In one company, people may work long hours. In another company, people may have a more relaxed schedule. We can see a company's culture in the way employees dress, how they communicate, and who they hire.\n\nValues are very important to understand. They tell us why people behave in certain ways. If saving face or being friendly is important in a culture, a negotiator will not embarrass his company to get what he wants. If a culture values getting a good deal, a negotiator will try to get the best deal he can.\n\nLearning about a culture and its values is important before a negotiation. But it is also important to get to know the other person. This can help make the negotiation more successful.",
            "There is no God, the fool has said in his heart. This idea is from the Christian Bible, in Psalm 14. Thomas Aquinas and St. Anselm both write about God. They have the same idea in mind. We will compare their ideas about God, but first, we need to agree that they are talking about the same kind of God. If we think of a different kind of God, we cannot compare their ideas. We will assume that they believe in the God of the Bible.\n\nLet's look at St. Anselm's idea. He thinks we can know God by looking inside ourselves. We can understand God by thinking about it. This means that we do not need outside proof for God's existence. We can know it is true just by thinking about it. This idea is called faith. We accept things that are true without evidence. This is a Christian idea.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas has a different idea. He thinks we can know God through reason and evidence. We do not need faith. This is a good idea for teaching others about God. People can learn about God through logic. St. Thomas gives five reasons why God exists. They are cause and effect, change, possibility, order, and perfection. He says that if we know one piece of a puzzle is missing, we can know what it looks like without seeing it.",
            "A long time ago, in the fifth or sixth century BC, a prince was born. He would later be called Buddha. This prince lived a long time ago and left the world to find inner peace. He became a wise teacher, and his teachings made Buddhism. Buddhism is a very old religion - over 2,500 years old. It has changed much since Buddha was alive. We can see this in the country of Sri Lanka, where Theravada Buddhists live. They have a special ceremony every year to cut water. Many people, both monks and people who are not monks, take part in this ceremony. However, Buddha never taught about such a celebration. Theravada Buddhism is different today than it was when Buddha was alive. This is true not just in small ways, but also in its deepest teachings. The Theravada Buddhist community has changed its ideas over time. This happened because of both good and bad things.\n\nThere are some important words we will use in this discussion. We will talk about inside and outside forces. An inside force is something that comes from people who believe in Buddhism. An outside force is something that comes from people who do not believe in Buddhism. A bad force is anything that harms the Buddhist community. A good force is anything that does not want to harm or help the Buddhist community, but it may do one or the other anyway.\n\nFirst, we need to learn about the basic ideas of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists believe in three things: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is like a book. It is made up of the Tripitaka, which is three baskets of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka has all the Buddhist talks. The Vinaya Pitaka has rules for how to live. The Abhidhamma Pitaka has ideas about the world and how it works. Some of these ideas are that we do not have a soul, that life is full of suffering, and that everything changes. If we understand these ideas, we can stop suffering. We can also stop being trapped in the cycle of death and rebirth. This cycle is called Sansara. Along with Sansara, we can stop having too much desire, hatred, and confusion. This happens when we become enlightened. The Vinaya Pitaka says how we should live. For people who are not monks, there are five rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not take something that is not yours, do not have sex with someone you should not, and do not take bad substances. For monks, there are many more rules. The most important idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. The first truth is that life is suffering. The second truth is that having too much of something can cause suffering. The third truth is that suffering can be stopped.",
            "The United States and Mexico had a long-lasting rivalry for 57 years. This rivalry started in 1836 and ended in 1893. The two countries fought a war in 1846-1848, and the United States won many battles. They took control of Texas and the American Southwest. The two countries disagreed on many issues, including religion, culture, and money. Their differences in interest led to many conflicts.\n\nThe United States and Mexico are not the only countries with a long rivalry. Countries that share a border often disagree on things. This is true for the United States and Mexico. They are not the only countries with a long rivalry. Cuba is another country that has had problems with the United States.\n\nThe United States and Mexico disagreed on religion. This is a common problem for many countries. In the past, the United States was against Catholicism. Mexico is a Catholic country. This made it hard for the two countries to have good relations.\n\nThe United States and Mexico also disagreed on who should be in power. This was a problem because of how the English and Spanish treated each other. The United States and Mexico got these feelings of distrust from their former rulers.\n\nThere were 17 fights between the United States and Mexico in 57 years. Most of these fights were over land and border problems. Some people from the United States would cross the border and cause trouble. To stop this, both countries used their armies to control their borders.\n\nAs time passed, Mexico became weaker, and the United States became stronger. This helped the rivalry end. The United States stopped wanting to take more land from Mexico and instead focused on helping Mexico economically.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became very sick. I was a nurse. I chose this job because I wanted to feel safe. When I was a child, I did not have a safe home. People told me, \"You will always find work. People are always sick.\"\n\nBut I wanted to be a scientist or a journalist. I wanted to learn many things. Even so, I chose nursing. Now I am 61 years old. I have no money. I have been on disability for 15 years. I am still very sick. Every day is hard. I need help from my family and friends. They help me a lot. I am not strong anymore.\n\nMy point is that accidents and problems can happen. We can prepare, but we cannot always solve our problems alone. We need help from others.\n\nI think we should not depend too much on the government. The government is not perfect. We should learn to help each other and ask for help. We should not build our own shelters alone.\n\nSome people say that Americans are strong and independent. But our ancestors were strong because they helped each other. They worked together. They shared food and resources. When pioneers traveled across the country, they did not go alone. They worked together.\n\nSo, be prepared. I have a disaster kit and food. I have flashlights and candles. But I also know my neighbors. You should know your neighbors too.",
            "Scientists want to know why living things change over time.  They are looking for rules that help explain how these changes happen.  Many years ago, a scientist named D'Arcy Thompson said that it is hard to use math to understand how living things develop.  Today, scientists are still trying.  A team of researchers is using math to study how shells of a type of animal called Prunum grow and change over time.\n\nThey are using X-rays to take pictures of the shells.  These pictures help them measure the shape of the shells.  They are then using a computer program to create pictures of what the shells might have looked like in the past or in the future.  This helps them understand how the shells changed over time.\n\nA shell is like a tube that grows in a spiral shape.  It turns around a center point called the columella.  The shell has lines called sutures that divide it into parts.  The last part of the shell is called the body whorl.  The other parts are called the spire.  The tip of the spire is called the apex, and the other end is called the base.  The shell has an opening called the aperture, and the animal comes out of this opening.\n\nThere are four ways to look at a shell: from the top (apical), from the bottom (basal), from the front (apertural), and from the back (abapertural).  Usually, people look at the shell from the front.\n\nTo count the turns of the shell, you look at it from the top and find the first line that divides the shell.  Then you draw a line and count the turns from there.  Each turn is divided into four parts.\n\nThe shell is like a path that the animal follows as it grows.  You can find the path by looking at the center of each turn and the size of the turn.  This path can be shown on a graph and mathematically explained.  Once you have the math, you can change the rules and see how the shell would grow differently.",
            "The number of babies and young children dying in Indonesia has not changed much in the last ten years.  The country is making progress in some areas, such as making sure people have clean water and sanitation.  However, the progress in health care for mothers and children is not fast enough to meet its goals by 2015. \n\nMany reasons are behind this problem.  We will look at these reasons and see that Indonesia needs to make its health system stronger instead of just focusing on special health programs.\n\nIndonesia has made some improvements.  More births are now attended by trained health workers.  But this number includes traditional workers like midwives who may not have the skills to help in emergency situations.  This means that many mothers are still dying from problems during delivery.  The health system still needs a lot of work.\n\nFewer children under five are getting medical help for diarrhea.  We do not have complete information about how well new mothers are being taken care of after childbirth.  But it is clear that this area needs more attention.\n\nFewer women are having cesarean sections than we would expect.  And the number of cesarean sections is very different between cities and rural areas.  This shows that people in cities have better access to healthcare.  The poor have a hard time getting medical help, often because they cannot afford it.\n\nTo improve health care for mothers and babies, the next question is: how can we best solve the problem of not having enough medical services?  Should Indonesia create special programs to help specific areas of health care, or should it focus on making its overall health system stronger?  We know that special programs can be helpful.  They have clear goals and can produce quick results.  But there are also some problems with this approach.  For example, when we give too much money to one area of health care, other areas may not get enough money or workers.  This can happen when we give a lot of money to one area and not enough to others.  We also have a problem with many programs working in the same area and not coordinating with each other.  This can make it hard for people to get the services they need.",
            "Two Victorian novels are different from others of their time. They are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These novels are not like other Victorian novels. They have mystery and strange things that happen. This makes the characters more interesting. It helps us understand their thoughts and feelings.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, strange things happen to Oliver. He sees things that are not real. These things show us what he is thinking and feeling. He has a lot of pain and fear.\n\nOne time, Oliver was shot. He remembers it like a dream. He does not have control over what happens to him. This makes him feel sad and helpless. He is not sure who is to blame for his problems. This shows that Oliver is not in control of his life.\n\nOliver is a victim of his circumstances. He has little power to change his life. Old Fagin is a bad influence on him.

            "I worked with a group of students after school two years ago. I helped them with their schoolwork. I was good at helping them with English and reading. A teacher asked me to work with a boy named Adrian. He was having trouble reading. Some letters were easy for him, but others were hard. He spoke perfect English, but he was not sure about the alphabet. I thought something was strange.\n\nI met Adrian's mother when she came to pick him up. She did not speak much English. We spoke a little Spanish, but it was hard for me. Then I understood the problem. Adrian could read, but he did not know the English alphabet well. I hope he is doing better now.\n\nI tell this story to show that language can be a problem in school. Even if a child speaks good English, reading can still be hard. We all agree that this is a problem. So, what can we do? For Adrian, the answer was simple. He needed help with his alphabet and pronunciation. But for other children who do not speak much English, the answer is more complicated.\n\nWe need to try different things. We can use the dual language system. This means teaching children in two languages. We can also have special classes for children who need help with English. But one thing is not enough. We need to use all of these things together.\n\nThe dual language system is a good idea. It helps children learn two languages. This can make them smarter and do better in school. Some people are afraid of this idea. They think it is a waste of money and that only some children will benefit. But this is not true. If we use this system for all children, they will all benefit.\n\nSo, how do we do this? Do we need all teachers to speak two languages? No, that would be hard. But we can have special helpers who speak two languages. They can work with teachers to help children learn.",
            "Most people learn as children that there is something bigger than they are. We call this something \"God.\" Some people go to Sunday school to learn about God. Others visit the Temple or look inside themselves for answers. Many people accept the ideas about God that their parents teach them. But some people do not believe in God. They think there is no life after death. We choose our own way to think about God. We try to understand ourselves by looking at our own ideas. We want to find meaning in life.\n\nMy father liked cardinals. He said so when I asked him. We sat on our porch, listening to the rain. Our house was old, and the tin roof made a loud sound. My father looked out at the rain. He looked sad and worried. He was not eating well, and his clothes were loose. His hair was thinning. I was afraid to talk to him about how I felt. I was afraid it would make things worse. So I hugged him and sat with him in silence.\n\nMy father died in December. He was sick for a long time. The doctors gave him medicine to help him feel better, but it did not work. My birthday was five days before he died. I was sad and alone. I thought about God, but I did not want to talk to him. If God was real, I thought, he had stopped listening to me a long time ago.\n\nI did not want to watch my father die. So I did not. I wanted to remember him as he was, not as he was when he was sick. I knew my father better than anyone. He would not have wanted me to be sad. I stayed in my bed for three days, waiting to hear the news. But no one called me.",
            "The Gothic Novel is a mix of old and new ideas. It is like an oxymoron, as Ian Watt says in \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel.\" People have given the Gothic mode many different opinions. Some think it is not deep, while others praise it for creating a feeling of fear and awe. \n\nThe first Gothic Novel, \"The Castle of Otranto,\" was written by Horace Walpole. It used old and new ideas from romances to create a new way to write stories. Walpole took old theatrical ideas and combined them with new things from modern novels. He called it \"A Gothic Story.\" The Gothic genre uses many old ideas from medieval times, such as theater, architecture, and traditions.\n\nAt the time of \"The Castle of Otranto,\" the word \"gothic\" was used to describe many things, people, and time periods. People thought it was old-fashioned and not sophisticated compared to modern society and literature. The combination of old and new things in the Gothic genre is what made it last a long time and seem both old and new to readers.\n\nOne important idea in Gothic novels is chivalry. Chivalry is the idea of training a good knight. It is kept and changed in \"The Castle of Otranto.\" Chivalry is important because it represents the ideal of a brave, honorable, and competent knight. Gothic writers, like Walpole, wanted to show that this ideal was missing in their society. They used the chivalric ideas to make the past seem better and to suggest that people could be better. Walpole wrote \"The Castle of Otranto\" during a time of trouble in politics. He was unhappy with the future and thought that people had lost the good qualities of the past. He showed this in his character, Frederic, who is a prince, has suffered, and is supposed to be dead. He is like a gallant and courteous knight, but also exaggerated, which is a new idea in the Gothic genre.",
            "Supply chain management is the process of moving goods from making raw materials into finished products. This process includes getting a customer's order, making the raw materials into products, and delivering the products to the customer. The idea of supply chain management was first used in 1982 by a business expert named Keith Oliver. He said it is a way to plan, control, and carry out the steps in the supply chain to satisfy customers quickly and efficiently.\n\nThere are six important parts of a supply chain: making products, getting raw materials, storing products, finding the right place to make products, moving products, and sharing information. Business managers use these six parts to give the best service to customers.\n\nFirst, making products is the first step in the supply chain. It is the base of the whole process. When deciding what to make and how to make it, managers need to know what customers want. To find out what customers want, managers look at the market. The market is a good indicator of what customers need.\n\nOnce managers know what customers want, they can decide what products to make and how many to make. They must also decide where to make the products and which factory will work best. This decision is based on how many products to make and how good the products will be. The customer's needs and satisfaction are very important.\n\nAfter deciding where to make the products, managers focus on planning work and taking care of equipment. Making products is a very important step in the supply chain. Every detail is important, and if not done correctly, it can cost a lot of money and time in the long run. For example, companies like Wal-Mart and Target have a plan for every part of their business. They have a plan for how employees should dress and how to receive shipments from trucks. Having a plan helps companies work smoothly and avoid mistakes.\n\nThe second important part of supply chain management is getting raw materials. This means making strategic decisions to decide what a factory can do well and what should be done by other companies. A company may have different groups that make different parts of a product. The manager must decide which group is best for each part. Managers may also decide to work with other companies to make parts. This can help create efficiency and save money.",
            "A sign in Burma says Hitler is alive.\n\nEllen Page, a famous actress, holds a sign on a street corner. The sign says a strange thing: \"Hitler is alive.\" Burma is a country in Southeast Asia. A group of strong men, the military, controls the country. They took power in 1962 in a violent act. In 2007, people in the street began to protest. The protesters were led by Buddhist monks. They wore special red robes. The people's protests were called \"The Saffron Revolution.\" The government agreed to let the monks meet peacefully, but then the violence started. The military attacked the monks and destroyed their homes. Some news reporters were arrested and put in jail. One reporter from Japan was killed in September 2007. The government said 13 people died, but a colonel who left the army said many more people died.\n\nThis has happened before. Many governments want to control their people and stop them from protesting. This has been happening since ancient times. Long ago, some Roman leaders said they were gods and had complete control. Some Japanese leaders were thought to be gods. Today, the leader of the United States talks to a man who leads a group of people who do not agree with others.\n\nWe have seen many examples of this. In 1989, people in China protested against their government. Many people died. Some said 200-300 died, but others said 2,000-3,000 died. In the 1990s, a group of people in Rwanda killed many others. They were from a different group. Hitler's rule in Germany was another example. He and his men killed many Jewish people.",
            "Duke Ellington's influence on jazz is very big. He was able to create music for a long time, and this helped him to be creative. He made his orchestra sound very good. In many of his compositions, Ellington plays the piano quietly, but as a composer, he is very good at writing music that lets the band members show off their skills. He wrote the framework for the band to play freely, and he also wrote tightly planned pieces that used the special style of each band member to add musical ideas. This made the orchestra sound good together and created new and original music. Ellington knew the sound of each band member and how they fit together, and this helped him to write some of the most creative and wonderful jazz music in history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary says that Ellington's sound is special because he used the voice as a musical instrument. One good example of this is Creole Love Call. In this song, Ellington used the voice to add sound and color. He did not use lyrics, which made it easy to hear the music. This song also shows how Ellington liked to work with the style of each band member. It is a slow song with a repeated pattern of 12 bars. There are six parts to the song:\n\n1. The voice and reeds talk to each other, with the voice starting smooth and then getting rougher.\n2. A trumpet solo that makes the basic melody sound better and adds long, sad notes.\n3. A clarinet solo that is very high and has a special piano sound.\n4. The whole band repeats the first part, with the brass and reed sections talking to each other.\n5. The climax of the song, where the reeds talk to each other in a high voice, and the brass and rhythm sections play a special kind of music.\n6. The song goes back to the first part, with the voice and reeds talking to each other again. This time, the voice sounds like a special instrument.\n\nEllington liked to use the voice to add color to his music, and this is one of the things that makes his music special.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, Ellington uses his skill at planning the music and his ear for sound to create a special sound. He makes a call and response between a trumpet player named Bubber Miley and a singer named Baby Cox. They use the sound of Miley's playing and the singing of Cox to create a rich and good sound. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) uses these ideas, too. Ellington uses a trombone player named Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to introduce the melody in a special way.",

            "This study looked at food choices and their effect on heart disease and stroke. The study used a special diet called the \"Mediterranean Diet.\" This diet includes a lot of fruits, nuts, whole grains, and fish. It has less animal products and saturated fats. Drinking some alcohol is okay.\n\nPrevious studies showed that people who eat this diet are less likely to die from heart disease. Another study showed that this diet helps people lose weight and lower their bad cholesterol levels.\n\nThis study followed 74,886 women between 38 and 63 years old. They did not have heart disease or diabetes. The women answered a series of questions about what they ate every year from 1984 to 2004. The researchers looked at the answers to see if the women who ate the Mediterranean Diet were less likely to get heart disease or have a stroke.\n\nThe researchers used a special number to measure how well the women ate the Mediterranean Diet. They looked at the number of heart disease and stroke cases over 20 years. They also looked at the number of deaths from heart disease and stroke.\n\nThe study found that women who ate a lot of the Mediterranean foods were less likely to get heart disease and stroke. In fact, they were 29% less likely to get heart disease and 29% less likely to have a stroke.",
            "The United States had a big financial problem in 2007. Many people lost their jobs, the housing market fell, and some big companies failed. This problem is still happening today. We need to understand how this problem started and how to stop it. The financial problem was caused by bad decisions made by the government. They made banks and companies make loans to people who could not pay them back. This was a big mistake because the country's financial system was not strong enough. Two companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were forced to buy and sell these bad loans. When people could not pay back these loans, the banks did not have enough money. They sold these bad loans to other people, which made the problem worse.\n\nThis problem started many years ago, in 1999. The President wanted to win another term in office. He made a rule to make it easier for people to get loans to buy houses. This rule helped create the problem that happened seven years later. In 1999, the New York Times reported, \"Fannie Mae wants to help people with low income get loans to buy houses.\" But the reporter warned, \"This could be a problem if the economy gets worse.\" He was right. The government helped Fannie Mae, but it made a big mistake.\n\nMany things made the economy worse. Banks made new kinds of loans that were not good. They were called adjustable-rate mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. These loans made the economy more connected to the housing market. Many people and companies borrowed too much money to buy houses. They were not ready for a problem in the housing market. When the housing market fell, many people and companies failed.\n\nThe five biggest investment banks in the United States had $4.1 trillion in bad loans in 2007. This was 30% of the country's money. Some big banks like Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers failed. Others like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to become regular banks with strict rules.

But too much exposition can be boring.\n\nYou know, \"show, don't tell\" is a basic writing rule. But even with that in mind, it's easy to fall into the trap of writing too much exposition. This can happen when you want to tell the reader too much about your characters and their world.\n\nLet's look at an example. Imagine you are reading a story and you are told that the main character met her husband at a certain time and place, and they got married in a big ceremony. But then you are told even more - that he was murdered in front of her. This can take up a lot of space in the story, and it's not very exciting.\n\nA better approach is to show this part of the story instead of just telling it. For example, you could show how much the husband loves his wife through his actions and words. You could also show how much his presence in her life changed her, by showing how she thinks and feels about him. This would make the reader care about him and be sad when he dies.\n\nThe key is to add details that make your story come alive. Instead of just saying \"They met, they married, he died,\" you could make the reader feel like they are a part of the story. This will keep them interested and engaged.\n\nAs a writer, you need to balance telling the reader what's happening with showing them. It's easy to get carried away with exposition, but it's better to give the reader a taste of the story and let them fill in the rest with their imagination.",
            "I watched two television news programs from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was on NBC 4 this morning. The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who hurt his wife very badly. His name is Shad Hostettler. The police arrested him. The news program showed his picture. He looked very bad. They talked about this story for two minutes because it was still happening. I think they used the right amount of time for this story.\n\nThe second story was about a young man named Travis Buyers. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area. He was 18 years old and very sick from his injury. The police were looking for the person who did this, but they did not know who it was. I noticed that this story was short. I think this might be because the man who was shot is black. I have seen this happen many times before. When a white person is hurt or missing, the news spends a lot of time on it. But when a black person is hurt or missing, the news does not talk about it as much.\n\nThe next story was about a helicopter that was shot. The police found a hole in it and think it was shot with a .22 caliber rifle. The police are offering a reward for information that can help them catch the person who did this.\n\nThe next story was about the weather. It will be hot and rainy on Saturday. The temperature will be in the mid 80s. They wanted to keep us watching, so they made it a short story.\n\nThey also talked about a store that was robbed. A black man took money from the store. He was wearing a dark hoodie and was about six feet tall and 150 pounds. They spent a lot of time talking about how black he was.\n\nAnother story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez. He was a big dealer of marijuana. He was caught and will be in prison for 25 years. They said he was Hispanic, but I do not think that was important to the story.",
            "There is a strong connection between brothers. This connection is very strong and cannot be broken. Inside this connection are many feelings: love, pride, jealousy, and anger. Brothers know each other very well. They can see themselves in their brother. When a bad situation happens, the true nature of this connection is clear. This connection can bring both good and bad things. When we understand the feelings that come from this connection, we must accept the results of these feelings. When we look at our brother, we see our own self. We see how others do not see us, but how we really are. Our actions and the results of these actions show our true character.\n\nIn the story \"The Scarlet Ibis\", two brothers show this connection and the strong emotions that come with it. The story takes place in a beautiful and vivid place. The two boys go on a difficult journey. Disappointment and pride are very strong in one scene. Only one brother survives. The story shows this connection through the main character, Doodle, and the way he interacts with his brother. The writer also tells us about the feelings of the main character and his view of the world. These feelings affect his actions.\n\nThe main character feels one main emotion: pride. He was angry at his brother Doodle from the beginning. He wanted a brother to teach and play with. He wanted someone to go on adventures with. But Doodle was very sick. He could not do the things the main character wanted. The main character was very sad and angry when he realized this. In fact, he even thought about hurting Doodle. But when Doodle smiled at him, he felt love for his brother. This shows that he really did love Doodle.",
            "The human brain is a very complicated and creative system that helps us process information. The way we talk about the brain has changed as technology has improved. At first, people compared the brain to a piece of wax, then to a piece of paper, then to a book, and now to a computer. But these comparisons are not perfect and can lead to misunderstandings.\n\nThe brain processes information in a very special way. First, it takes in information from our senses. Our senses are like special tools that help us feel, see, hear, touch, or taste things. The brain takes this information and changes it into signals that it can understand.\n\nThe brain uses two ways to process information. One way is to start with small pieces of information and put them together to understand something new. This is like building a puzzle. For example, when you look at a picture of a black box, you start by seeing the colors and the lines. Then, your brain puts these pieces together to understand that you are looking at a box.\n\nThe other way is to use information that you already know to help you understand something new. This is like using a map to find your way. If you see a picture of a black box, your brain might use what it already knows about boxes to help you understand what you are looking at.\n\nThe brain also has a special filter that decides what information is important and what you should pay attention to. For example, when you look at the grass, your brain does not notice each individual blade. But if someone calls your name, you hear it clearly.\n\nInformation in the brain is stored in three kinds of memory: short-term, working, and long-term. Short-term memory stores information for a short time, like 20 seconds. Working memory is like a computer that stores information while it is being used. Long-term memory stores information for a long time.\n\nThe brain processes and stores information in different ways. Some scientists study how people remember things, while others study how computers work, or how the brain itself works. One way to understand how the brain works is to think of it like a network of connections. These connections help us understand how we remember things. For example, if you think of a chair, your brain might connect it to other things like a table or wood.",
            "Aldous Huxley writes a book called Brave New World. It is a story about a future world where people value being happy more than anything else. They are taught from a young age to be happy and not to think deeply about anything. The people in this world are not in charge. A group called the World Controller decides what is best for them. Huxley thinks this is a bad system.\n\nHe uses ideas from a man named Karl Marx to show how this system is not good. Marx said that when people work for a company, they do not have control over their lives. They work only for a salary. Huxley's book says the same thing. The people in the story do not think about how they are treated. They are happy to buy things and enjoy themselves.\n\nHuxley is also saying that this system makes people not think for themselves. They are controlled by the World Controller. The people in the story are like pawns in a game. They do not have any power. They are only happy to do what they are told.\n\nIn the story, there are different classes of people. The classes are like groups. Some people are more powerful than others. But the people in the lower classes do not know they are not in control. They are happy to be like everyone else. Some people are born with more power than others. But they do not use their power to help others.\n\nHuxley is saying that this system is not good. People should be able to think for themselves and make their own choices. They should not be controlled by someone else. In the story, people do not have deep relationships. They do not love each other. They only care about how they look and what they own.\n\nThe people in the story are happy to do what they are told. They do not question anything. This is like what Marx said about people who work for a company. They do not have control over their lives. They are only happy to get a paycheck.\n\nHuxley's book is a warning about the dangers of this system. He thinks it is not good for people. We should be able to think for ourselves and make our own choices.",
            "I am a student at University Park. I have been here for two and a half years. It can be hard to get around the campus. My freshman year, I was in a dorm room in East Halls, near the end of campus. I had to walk a long way to get to classes in the Willard building, near the center of campus. This walk could take 25 minutes, especially in bad weather. I talked to an old friend. He said he stopped riding a bike for a few years, but now he rides one again. He said, \"Bikes are great. They are the best way to get around.\" Riding a bike is good for your body. It is also the best way to travel. If you eat breakfast and ride a bike, you can go 30 miles or more. I live off campus now. I decided to buy a bike. It was a good decision. I ride my bike to class every day. I have a class in Thomas building. It is a 25-minute walk from my home. But if I ride my bike, it takes only 5 minutes. The road to Thomas building is not always easy to ride on. But I need my bike. If I didn't have one, I would have to walk. Walking would take an extra 30-40 minutes every day. This is two and a half hours every week. I am too busy to walk. I need my bike to get to class on time."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",

The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

The sociocultural model looks at how the environment affects people.\n\nThe biological model examines genetic information and health problems that can cause insomnia. The sociocultural model looks at how people's environments, such as their race, age, and income, affect their sleep.\n\nWe will look at some research on insomnia. This research will explain the different parts of the biological and sociocultural models. Then, we will talk about the strengths and weaknesses of each study.\n\nInsomnia is a sleep problem. It can be caused by different things. Sometimes, it is a sleep problem by itself. Other times, it is a problem connected to another mental health issue. There are several kinds of sleep problems. They can be caused by medical problems or by taking certain medicines.\n\nThere are two kinds of sleep problems. One kind is called Dyssonmias. The other kind is called Parasomnias. Dyssonmias are problems with falling asleep or staying asleep. Parasomnias are problems with acting out or moving while asleep.\n\nThe biological model says that genetics and health problems can cause insomnia. Our brains have special cells that help us sleep. These cells are in the part of the brain called the hypothalamus. These cells contain a substance that helps us sleep. If these cells do not work correctly, we may have trouble sleeping.\n\nOne study looked at mice and found that a special receptor in the brain helps us sleep. This receptor is called the GABAB receptor. If this receptor is not working correctly, we may have trouble sleeping. The study found that a medicine can help people sleep by affecting this receptor.\n\nThe sociocultural model says that our environment affects our sleep. If we have a family history of insomnia, we may be more likely to have insomnia. If we are under a lot of stress, we may have trouble sleeping.\n\nThis study shows that genetics and the environment can affect our sleep. It also shows that we may be able to cure insomnia by using medicine that affects the GABAB receptor.",
            "This paper is about Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). CAPD is a problem with the brain. It is not a hearing problem. People with CAPD can hear sounds, but their brain has trouble understanding what they hear.\n\nThe brain helps us understand what we hear. It separates sounds and helps us know what someone is saying. People with CAPD have trouble with this part of the brain. It is called the central nervous system (CNS).\n\nCAPD was first talked about in the 1950s. Researchers studied children with speech problems. They made tests to help diagnose the problem. In 1954, a team of researchers in Italy started working on these tests. In 1961, another researcher came up with a way to test how the brain works when it hears two sounds at the same time.\n\nCAPD can cause problems with hearing. A person with CAPD may not know where a sound is coming from. They may have trouble hearing two or more sounds. They may not understand speech patterns. They may not know when someone is being serious or not. They may not be able to block out background noise. They may not be able to make sense of what they hear.\n\nTo find out if someone has CAPD, doctors use tests. These tests look at how the person hears and responds to sounds. There are many types of tests. Doctors may ask questions or watch how the person behaves. There is no single test that can diagnose CAPD. Tests may include listening to many sounds and then trying to pick out certain words or numbers.\n\nTeachers can help students with CAPD in a regular classroom. They can make sure the student sits in a quiet place. They can ask the student to repeat what they hear. They can break down instructions into simple steps. They can use visual aids to help the student understand.",
            "The play Twelfth Night says that using a fake identity can be helpful in hiding the truth, but it can also cause problems. If you continue to lie, you may forget who you really are. In the play, the main problem with ending a lie is that you may hurt the people around you.\n\nThe play talks about a man pretending to be a woman. This is a big problem because it makes us wonder why the character in the play wants to hide who they are. In the play, a woman named Viola pretends to be a man to protect herself. This works, but it also makes her friends and family unhappy.\n\nViola is very good at pretending to be a man. She is so good that another woman in the play, Olivia, falls in love with her. Viola also has feelings for a man in the play, but she is pretending to be a man so she can't express her true feelings.\n\nThe play may be saying that lying can help people see their true feelings. Some characters in the play may have feelings they don't want to admit. They see the person pretending to be someone else and that makes them think about their own feelings. For example, a woman in the play falls in love with a man who is pretending to be a woman. But she quickly falls in love with a real man who looks like the person she fell in love with. This makes us wonder if she really liked the person pretending to be a woman or if she just liked the look of them.\n\nThe play is showing us that people may judge others based on how they look. The woman in the play who falls in love with the person pretending to be a woman quickly forgets about them when the real man appears. This makes us think about how people may be quick to judge others based on looks rather than who they really are.",
            "The German colonial rule was very cruel. It killed many people, especially the Ovaherero and Nama in South West Africa. But the German colonial rule was not the same everywhere. The policies and way of ruling were different in different places. The German colonies were very different from each other.\n\nThe colonies with educated Africans were in East Africa. The British took over this area in 1919. They found many Africans who could read and write. German education in Kamerun and other colonies was also very good.\n\nBut South West Africa was different. The government did not help Africans much with education. Only a few organizations that were not the government helped Africans learn. The government spent more money on schools for Europeans. The government also controlled the schools for Europeans. This made a big difference in South West Africa. Many Africans did not go to school and could not read or write.\n\nOther German colonies had many educated Africans. But in South West Africa, most people were not educated. This was because of many reasons. We will talk about these reasons in this paper. We will also look at how European settlers and the government felt about Africans.\n\nThere are many books and studies about education in German colonies. Most of these were written in German a long time ago. Later, people wrote about education in different colonies and how it was the same or different. One person, Cohen, studied education in South West Africa and East Africa. He said that the number of European settlers in South West Africa was a main reason for the difference in education.\n\nSouth West Africa was a place with a good climate. Many Europeans lived there because it was not too hot. In 1913, 15,000 Europeans lived in South West Africa. This was more than in any other German colony except East Africa.",
            "Heavy metal music is a big group of music styles. It has grown a lot over the past 100 years. Many subgroups of heavy metal have developed. Some of these subgroups have smaller subgroups. This makes it hard to list all kinds of heavy metal music.\n\nHeavy metal music started out a long time ago. But over the years, it has changed a lot. People started to make their own types of heavy metal music. This led to many new kinds of heavy metal. Today, there are many different kinds of heavy metal.\n\nSo, what is heavy metal music? Heavy metal music is known for being loud and dark. It often has strong beats and strong guitar sounds. Many people in heavy metal bands are very good at playing their instruments. They put a lot of feeling into their music.\n\nHeavy metal music is also connected to the use of drugs. In the 1970s, many people used drugs to create their music. This led to some strange and unusual sounds. Some people say that the use of drugs helped create the dark and crazy sound that is typical of heavy metal music.\n\nMany heavy metal songs have lyrics that are about dark and sad things. These lyrics reflect the darker side of life. One of the first heavy metal songs was \"Helter Skelter.\" It was written by the Beatles and is about the ups and downs of life. It was a response to a song by the Rolling Stones. The Beatles wanted to show that they could make music that was just as heavy and dark as the Stones.",
            "Henri Rousseau was a famous painter. He painted a picture called The Dream in 1910. This painting shows a woman who is very happy in a dream world. But The Dream is more than just a picture. It shows Rousseau's own dreams and goals as a painter. He wanted to be recognized and liked by other artists and people who love art.\n\nRousseau had a hard time achieving his goal. He had to decide if he should paint like other artists or be different. He wanted to fit in with the art world, but he also wanted to be himself.\n\nTo understand The Dream, we need to know something about Rousseau's life. He was born in a town in northwest France in 1844. His father was a hardware dealer and had a good job. Rousseau grew up without learning art. He worked for the government until he was 40 years old. People called him a customs inspector, but he was really a gabelou.\n\nRousseau's first wife died when their eight children were young. He was left with a daughter and a lot of sadness. He started painting to feel better and find a new life. Unlike other artists who painted about the poor, Rousseau painted about everyday people like himself.\n\nRousseau wanted to be accepted by the art world. He was older than many other artists, and they were famous already. But he didn't get recognition until the same time that another artist, Matisse, was becoming famous. They were different because Matisse wanted to paint in a new way, but Rousseau wanted to paint in a way that was accepted by the art world.",
            "We know that many great thinkers believe there is a strong connection between ethics and beauty, between what is true and what is good. I agree with this idea. The poet John Keats said, \"Beauty is truth. Truth is beauty. That is all you need to know.\" We learn many things in life through education and experience, but we also feel that ethics and aesthetics are special. They are not just rules or laws. Our studies of morality and beauty try to explain why something is beautiful or why an action is right. But we cannot fully explain these things. When we talk about a great work of art or literature, we can talk about its details, but we often can't fully explain why it is so good.\n\nFor example, we can discuss the details of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, but we can't fully describe what makes it beautiful. When we talk about our favorite work of art or literature, we often say things like, \"There is just something about it.\" This \"something\" is hard to explain. I believe that both art and morality have this quality. As the writer Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that cannot be said in any other way.\" We can describe the details of a story, but there is something more to it.\n\nI think that ethics and aesthetics are connected because they work in the same way. We experience them at a deep level, but we can't fully explain them. This connection is even stronger with literature. Literature is special because it deals with values. Literature helps us understand what is important in life. The writer McKean said, \"What makes literature special is its moral quality. Literature is important to us because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany is a strong country today. It is a united country with a mix of cultures. You can feel this mix in many places in Germany. From München, near the Alps, to Kiel, a city by the Baltic Sea. You can also feel it in Köln, on the river Rhine, and in Dresden, on the Elbe River.\n\nGermany has a unique culture. But it comes from many different places. Many different tribes lived in Germany long ago. The country is called Germania. Scholars and historians do not agree on where the name came from. Some think it came from a group of people called the Tungrians.\n\nA long time ago, a Roman leader named Julius Caesar wrote about the people of Germania. He used the word \"Germanus\" to describe them. He got this word from the Gauls, a group of people he fought against. Caesar used the word to show the difference between the Gauls and the people he had not yet defeated.\n\nSome people think the word \"German\" comes from a spear called a \"ger\". Others think it comes from an old Irish word \"garim\", which means \"to shout\". This might mean that the Germans were loud.\n\nA Roman historian named Tacitus wrote about the origins of the Germans. He said that the Germans were an old group of people who did not mix with other groups. They lived in a rough country with bad weather and were not easy to live with. Not many people from Rome wanted to live in Germany.\n\nThe Romans would sometimes send armies to Germany to get goods. But they usually went back to Rome. The Germanic tribes lived on the edge of the Roman Empire. They traded with the Romans and served in the Roman army.",
            "I looked down at the toilet in front of me. My mind was empty. I did not think about the toilet or what I was seeing. I just looked. My brain was like a tool that worked by itself. It took in what I was seeing, but did not think about it.\n\nI had always wanted to draw. When I was six years old, I started to think about drawing. Later, I found a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" It teaches people to draw. One thing it says to do is to put a square around the thing you want to draw. This makes it easier to see.\n\nI could not do that with the toilet in front of me. It was too much. I was amazed. Many artists have their own way of seeing things. Picasso liked blue. Monet liked green. The old masters used all the colors. If I wanted to be a good artist, I had to start by looking at this brown thing in front of me.\n\nMy hand moved to the toilet handle. I pulled it down. But the brown thing did not move. I pulled it down again. It still did not move.\n\nI grabbed a mop and stood in front of the toilet. I was not happy. Someone had left a messy present for the toilet cleaners at Rite Aid. I used the mop to try and get the brown thing out of the toilet. I used the toilet paper to make my hand warm and protected. Then I slowly put my hand in the toilet bowl. It was like putting a turkey in the oven for Thanksgiving.",
            "More and more teenagers are dying in car accidents.  Several reasons work together to cause this problem.  One reason is that the young brain is not ready for the dangers of driving.  The young brain is not experienced.  This lack of experience causes many deaths.  It also causes many accidents, such as turning over, speeding, and driving off the road.\n\nTeenagers are also more likely to have accidents when they drive with their friends.  A study in California found that the number of car accidents increases with the age of the passenger.\n\nSome states, including California, have made a rule for teenagers who are learning to drive.  These rules say that teenagers can only drive for a few hours a day and cannot drive with friends who are also teenagers.  But I think these rules are not enough.  The real problem is that young drivers are not good at handling the dangers of driving.\n\nA psychologist named Marvin Zuckerman says that people under 20 years old are not ready to drive.  He has studied how young people like to take risks.  This makes sense.  If we give driver's licenses to young teenagers, many more people will be hurt or killed in car accidents.  In a few years, the number of deaths will be very high.  Many more teenagers will be able to drive soon.\n\nIf we want to keep our teenagers safe, we need to make a rule that says no one under 18 can drive a car.  Schools can still teach teenagers how to drive.  But teenagers must wait until they are 18 to get a driver's license.  We can still give teenagers a special permit that allows them to practice driving with an adult.  They must practice for a certain number of hours before they can take a test to get a driver's license.\n\nThis is not a new idea.  Many states already have rules like this.  We can make a rule that is the same for all states.  This will help keep our teenagers safe.",
            "I looked at films from the Library of Congress. I chose to watch trick films from 1895 to 1901. There were 15 of these films. They trick the eye with creative editing. My study of these films looked at their artistic side and how they changed over time. \n\nMost of these films stay in one place and do not move. The camera does not move. The films are long and use many shots to create an illusion. \n\nOne thing trick films have in common is they are shot in a fixed place. The camera does not move to follow people or objects. This style came from theater and magic shows. In these films, people move side to side. They do not move towards or away from the camera. \n\nMost trick films are long shots or medium shots. They are not close-ups. This is like theater, where the audience sees the whole performance. Actors do not move towards the camera. \n\nMost trick films are short, usually less than a minute. They are like magic tricks. They do tricks, like making things disappear or change. One trick film shot does not always mean one physical shot. It might be many shots joined together to make an illusion. \n\nOne early trick film is The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots. At first, it looks like one shot. But if you look closely, you can see when the camera shot of Mary's fake head starts. The whole film looks like one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a strong supporter of Republican ideas. He was a farmer, but his work and short time in politics made him known for caring about personal freedom and government. He believed that farming was the best way of life, and this idea guided his thoughts on the government. He wanted to protect and support farmers, which influenced his views on power, laws, and the justice system.\n\nJohn Taylor thought the United States had a great chance to create a perfect system of government. There was no old tradition to follow, so the country's founders could create a system that worked for everyone. He believed in the natural rights of people, which are basic rights that everyone has. He thought that if one person does not have these rights, others will suffer too. These rights should not be controlled by the government.\n\nTaylor believed that in a society, some people might use their strength and cleverness to get what they want. But in a country, this should not be the way things work. To create a good society, the government should understand that people have good and bad qualities. Taylor thought that a government should protect private property, help farmers, and prevent people from getting too much power. He believed that a government like this would work well no matter who was in charge.\n\nTaylor also believed that people are motivated by self-interest, but this is only bad if it means hurting others. He thought a good government should control people's bad qualities and watch out for bad principles that can harm society. A good government would keep people from being cruel to each other.\n\nTaylor wanted the government to limit its power, as stated in the Constitution. He thought a big government was expensive and could be unfair. However, he also believed that following the Constitution too strictly could lead to problems. He thought the Declaration of Independence was more important because it said the United States was a group of independent states, not just one country.",
            "We look at Figure 17. There was a big drop in commuter log entries in the third month of the project. This was not good news. We do not know why this happened. It is possible that the drop in people walking or biking because of winter weather is partly to blame. In New England, people often need to walk or bike less in winter. In December, students and teachers are busy finishing schoolwork and getting grades. They may not have time to fill out the commuter log. This month also starts the holiday season. Many people do not need to go to school for a month. Classes will start again in late January. But we do not understand why people were not filling out the log in February. Maybe people have less energy at the beginning of a project like this. We tried to solve this problem by creating the Carpool Challenge Week. This was a special effort to get people excited about the project again. It worked and we got more log entries in March. So, we need to find a way to keep people interested in the project. We also need to fight against people's love of driving their cars. This is a big problem in our culture. We tried to solve this by offering prizes like gift cards. We gave these out at local restaurants, coffee shops, and stores. We thought this would help people change their behavior. But it would have been interesting to see if bigger prizes would help even more. For example, we could have given away a bike, a hybrid car, or an electric car. This could have helped people be more interested in the project. The prizes we offered did not change during the project. If we had offered bigger prizes in December and January, it might have helped people be more interested.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that follows a group of stocks or a commodity.  It is like an index fund but is more flexible and can be bought and sold on an exchange like a stock.  ETFs give you the benefits of many stocks and the ability to buy and sell easily.  They have low costs, but you must pay a commission to buy or sell them.  Many ETFs are available.  Before buying an ETF, it is a good idea to look at its benefits and see if they are real.\n\nWe will look at the ETF IHF.  This ETF has ten main stocks that make up 63.58% of all its assets.  We will compare the returns and risks of these ten stocks to the ETF as a whole.  If we use the same amounts of these ten stocks together, we can see how well they represent the ETF.\n\nOur calculations show that these ten stocks could give a 16% higher return than the ETF.  They also have less risk.  But we need to know if these results are real or just a chance.  To do this, we will look at the risk of each stock and see how much it adds to the overall risk of the portfolio.\n\nWe will examine the standard deviation of each stock to see if the portfolio of ten stocks is truly less risky than the ETF.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe says \"Dream-Land\" is one of his best poems. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe uses the word \"Thulé.\" He got this word from a famous writer named Virgil. Virgil used \"Thulé\" to describe an island north of Britain. This island was the edge of the known world for the Greeks.\n\nPoe was interested in German writers. One of them is Goethe. Poe liked Goethe's writing. In fact, some people think Poe copied some of Goethe's ideas. A man named Karl J. Arndt wrote a book about this. He said Poe's poem \"Politian\" is similar to Goethe's poem \"Mignon.\"\n\nGoethe was a well-known writer of a play called \"Faust.\" This play was published in two parts. The first part was released in 1808, and the second part was released in 1832 when Goethe died. Inside \"Faust,\" there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem is about a king who loses his wife. After she dies, he drinks a lot and cries. He then decides to die too. Before he dies, he gives his money and things to his children. The only thing he keeps is a special cup his wife gave him. He goes to a cliff, throws the cup into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The king in \"The King of Thulé\" and the king in Poe's \"Dream-Land\" are very similar. They both have a sad story about loss.\n\nPoe mentions Thulé twice in his writings. He says \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" but he uses \"Thulé\" twice in \"Dream-Land.\" \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" are like two poems that go together. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker says he is in a place called Thulé. He describes Thulé as a dark and lonely place. He sees dead friends and a world without color. This is similar to \"The King of Thule\" by Goethe. In \"The King of Thule,\" the king is also lonely and has lost his wife. He has lost his will to live.\n\nGoethe was a famous writer that Poe liked. Poe respected another writer named Tennyson. Poe admired Tennyson's work. Poe would have known Goethe's work because of Tennyson. Poe also saw many reproductions of Goethe's writing after it was first published.",
            "In California, a customer who gets hurt after slipping and falling on a spill in a store can ask for extra money from the store. This money is called punitive damages. But to get it, the customer must prove that the store manager acted with mean intention. \n\nImagine a customer slipped and fell on applesauce in a store. The store manager knew about the spill twice, but he did not clean it for 30 minutes because he was eating dinner. A judge is not likely to throw out the customer's claim for extra money. The customer must show that the manager knew his actions could cause harm and he did not care. \n\nThere was a problem with spills in the store before. Many customers had slipped and fallen. The manager knew about this. But he did nothing to fix the problem. This is why the customer is asking for extra money. The customer will say that the manager was mean and did not care about the harm he could cause.\n\nA manager at the store found out about the spill twice. He said he was busy eating dinner and did not have time to clean it. But he did not clean it for 30 minutes. The customer slipped and fell and got hurt.

The customer is suing the store for money to pay for her injury and to punish the store for its actions.\n\nIn California, a customer can ask for extra money if the store manager acted with mean intention.

            "Four years ago, I took a course in Islam at CBC.  We discussed whether Islam is a hostile religion.  Now this question is more important than ever.  I have seen how the media changed its view of Islam.  After 9/11, the media was against Islam.  Now it is very tolerant.  I think it is interesting that in 2001, a presidential candidate like Barack Obama could come to power.  He has Muslim family members.\n\nI am interested in the story of the Prophet Muhammad.  What I learned about him did not match his biography.  I thought he forced people to become Muslims.  He took over tribes and made them join Islam.  But his biography says he was a humble person who was often misunderstood.  People came to him because they believed in his teachings.\n\nThere are many similarities between Muhammad's life and the life of Jesus.  One example is when Muhammad had very little food and made it multiply so that many people could eat.  This kind of writing makes me think the authors wanted Muhammad to look like a humble prophet who did not need to prove anything.  He just lived a truthful life with miracles.  I think this is a problem because it makes Jesus' life and teachings seem less important.\n\nI do not like the way the biography presents stories.  Many of the stories come from people who heard from others.  This makes the stories seem suspicious.  I think the authors wanted to show that people converted to Islam on their own.  But I do not think this is true.\n\nWhat worries me most is that the biography tries to make Muhammad look like a good and humble person.  But history says he was not like that.  I wonder if Muslims today know the truth about Muhammad's past.",
            "We can see a change in Christian thought since Jesus' time.  People did not follow his teachings after he died.  A new path was chosen.  If we look at history, we can see a pattern.  Christians moved away from what Jesus believed.  Today, we see many people are more open-minded.  They want to know more about the past.  Traditional people will still exist, but they will not be the only ones.  Many Christians will learn more about Jesus' life and teachings.  They will want to know the original ideas of the Christian religion.  It may take time, but the result will be clear:  Christians will go back to the beginning.  They will remove ideas that were added later.  They will go back to what Jesus said.  It will be like a clock moving backward.  Only the true ideas of Jesus will remain.\n\nIn the United States and Europe, people will follow Jesus' ideas more closely.  They will worship like he taught.  The church will still be strong, but it will be simpler.  People will follow the same ideas everywhere.  We will see less difference between different Christian groups.  History shows us that this can happen.  Christians were once treated badly by the Roman Empire.  But later the empire became Christian.  Our country went from being against African-American rights to having African-American leaders.  The same thing will happen with Christianity.  People will go back to the source.  They will see that Jesus' words are not always meant to be taken literally.\n\nLooking back in history, we see that Christianity started with Judaism.  The Jewish people had many different groups.  They had Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and many common people.  They did not agree on everything.  By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., the Jewish people believed in one God.  They believed in the Bible and its teachings.  But they were not the same.  They had different ideas.",

They do not care about the pollution that harms people and animals. They also do not care about their workers. They work the workers very hard and pay them little.\n\nThe workers have no rights.

            "Many writers use different ways to make readers feel a certain way about important subjects. \nF. Scott Fitzgerald uses these techniques in his book The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, he pairs a word with another word that do not usually fit together to create a certain feeling. Other times, he gives meaning to a symbol and uses it for the same purpose. \n\nFitzgerald uses the last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white, gray, and red. He builds meaning for these colors and then uses it to show readers a feeling about an important thing. \n\nFitzgerald creates meaning for white and gray. He thinks white is better and more upper class, and gray is older and faded. He shows this in the beginning of the book by using these colors many times. \n\nDaisy and Jordan are always wearing white. Everyone wears white at Gatsby's party. Nick wears white clothes, Tom wears a white shirt, and Catherine looks very white. The only time people are not wearing white is when Nick describes Gatsby's party and sees many bright colors. Fitzgerald also uses white and gray to describe ordinary things. \n\nAs Nick goes to work, he goes down a white valley in New York. The names of people at Gatsby's party are gray on Nick's list. Catherine's apartment is like a long white cake. He also describes ordinary people and places as white or gray. Jordan and Daisy have a white childhood, there are gray cars and land in a sad place, an Italian child is gray, and a dog-seller is an old gray man.\n\nAfter Fitzgerald gives meaning to white and gray, he uses them to show readers that something is not important or is the same. He uses this technique with Daisy first. After a long time, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as a woman in white. Readers start to see Daisy as not a person, but as something Gatsby wants. \n\nFitzgerald uses this technique many times with Daisy to show that she is not special. For example, there is a gray fog on Daisy's fur, and she wears a white dress before Tom and Gatsby meet.",

Farmers grow many things here, including tomatoes, oranges, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, and honey. People want to eat food grown without chemicals, and many organizations in San Diego have long waiting lists. Many farmers also sell organic eggs and milk.\n\nSome farms in the area allow visitors to walk around and see how they grow their food. Farmers can earn money by giving tours and offering hiking and birdwatching. This can also help the environment. The government gives money to farmers who grow food without chemicals, and this can help protect the land and wildlife.\n\nBut farming without chemicals can be harder and more expensive. Farmers must work harder and spend more time removing pests and weeds and fertilizing the soil without using chemicals. They can also lose more food than farmers who use chemicals. Small farms are less efficient than big farms because they do not have as much land. They must also spend more time and money on things that help the environment, such as planting special crops and removing invasive plants.\n\nThe land I chose is in a place called Potrero, California. It is 160 acres of land with different types of plants and trees. Many species of plants and animals live here, including some that are endangered. The government is making a plan to protect this area and the animals that live here.\n\nPeople lived on this land for a long time before it was used for farming. It was used to raise cattle and sell wood. Now, I want to show how a farmer could grow food here and protect the environment at the same time.\n\nI found a real farm in the area and used it as an example of what a farmer could do. The farm is in the same climate and has the same types of plants and animals. The farmer can get help from the government and make money by giving tours and selling organic food.",
            "Culture is very important in any negotiation. To understand culture, we must know what it is not and what it means. Culture is not the same everywhere. It is not a single or uniform thing. Making general statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" is not helpful. It is better to learn about a culture and how it will affect the negotiation.\n\nWhen we meet a new culture, we can compare it to our own culture. We can learn about its history and its problems. Instead of judging or trying to change a culture, we should accept it and work within its rules. This is especially true if we are in a weaker position in the negotiation.\n\nCulture is not just about countries. Companies also have their own culture. In one company, people may work long hours. In another company, people may have a more relaxed schedule. We can see a company's culture in the way employees dress, how they communicate, and who they hire.\n\nValues are very important to understand. They tell us why people behave in certain ways. If saving face or being friendly is important in a culture, a negotiator will not embarrass his company to get what he wants. If a culture values getting a good deal, a negotiator will try to get the best deal he can.\n\nLearning about a culture and its values is important before a negotiation. But it is also important to get to know the other person. This can help make the negotiation more successful.",
            "There is no God, the fool has said in his heart. This idea is from the Christian Bible, in Psalm 14. Thomas Aquinas and St. Anselm both write about God. They have the same idea in mind. We will compare their ideas about God, but first, we need to agree that they are talking about the same kind of God. If we think of a different kind of God, we cannot compare their ideas. We will assume that they believe in the God of the Bible.\n\nLet's look at St. Anselm's idea. He thinks we can know God by looking inside ourselves. We can understand God by thinking about it. This means that we do not need outside proof for God's existence. We can know it is true just by thinking about it. This idea is called faith. We accept things that are true without evidence. This is a Christian idea.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas has a different idea. He thinks we can know God through reason and evidence. We do not need faith. This is a good idea for teaching others about God. People can learn about God through logic. St. Thomas gives five reasons why God exists. They are cause and effect, change, possibility, order, and perfection. He says that if we know one piece of a puzzle is missing, we can know what it looks like without seeing it.",
            "A long time ago, in the fifth or sixth century BC, a prince was born. He would later be called Buddha. This prince lived a long time ago and left the world to find inner peace. He became a wise teacher, and his teachings made Buddhism. Buddhism is a very old religion - over 2,500 years old. It has changed much since Buddha was alive. We can see this in the country of Sri Lanka, where Theravada Buddhists live. They have a special ceremony every year to cut water. Many people, both monks and people who are not monks, take part in this ceremony. However, Buddha never taught about such a celebration. Theravada Buddhism is different today than it was when Buddha was alive. This is true not just in small ways, but also in its deepest teachings. The Theravada Buddhist community has changed its ideas over time. This happened because of both good and bad things.\n\nThere are some important words we will use in this discussion. We will talk about inside and outside forces. An inside force is something that comes from people who believe in Buddhism. An outside force is something that comes from people who do not believe in Buddhism. A bad force is anything that harms the Buddhist community. A good force is anything that does not want to harm or help the Buddhist community, but it may do one or the other anyway.\n\nFirst, we need to learn about the basic ideas of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists believe in three things: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is like a book. It is made up of the Tripitaka, which is three baskets of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka has all the Buddhist talks. The Vinaya Pitaka has rules for how to live. The Abhidhamma Pitaka has ideas about the world and how it works. Some of these ideas are that we do not have a soul, that life is full of suffering, and that everything changes. If we understand these ideas, we can stop suffering. We can also stop being trapped in the cycle of death and rebirth. This cycle is called Sansara. Along with Sansara, we can stop having too much desire, hatred, and confusion. This happens when we become enlightened. The Vinaya Pitaka says how we should live. For people who are not monks, there are five rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not take something that is not yours, do not have sex with someone you should not, and do not take bad substances. For monks, there are many more rules. The most important idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. The first truth is that life is suffering. The second truth is that having too much of something can cause suffering. The third truth is that suffering can be stopped.",
            "The United States and Mexico had a long-lasting rivalry for 57 years. This rivalry started in 1836 and ended in 1893. The two countries fought a war in 1846-1848, and the United States won many battles. They took control of Texas and the American Southwest. The two countries disagreed on many issues, including religion, culture, and money. Their differences in interest led to many conflicts.\n\nThe United States and Mexico are not the only countries with a long rivalry. Countries that share a border often disagree on things. This is true for the United States and Mexico. They are not the only countries with a long rivalry. Cuba is another country that has had problems with the United States.\n\nThe United States and Mexico disagreed on religion. This is a common problem for many countries. In the past, the United States was against Catholicism. Mexico is a Catholic country. This made it hard for the two countries to have good relations.\n\nThe United States and Mexico also disagreed on who should be in power. This was a problem because of how the English and Spanish treated each other. The United States and Mexico got these feelings of distrust from their former rulers.\n\nThere were 17 fights between the United States and Mexico in 57 years. Most of these fights were over land and border problems. Some people from the United States would cross the border and cause trouble. To stop this, both countries used their armies to control their borders.\n\nAs time passed, Mexico became weaker, and the United States became stronger. This helped the rivalry end. The United States stopped wanting to take more land from Mexico and instead focused on helping Mexico economically.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became very sick. I was a nurse. I chose this job because I wanted to feel safe. When I was a child, I did not have a safe home. People told me, \"You will always find work. People are always sick.\"\n\nBut I wanted to be a scientist or a journalist. I wanted to learn many things. Even so, I chose nursing. Now I am 61 years old. I have no money. I have been on disability for 15 years. I am still very sick. Every day is hard. I need help from my family and friends. They help me a lot. I am not strong anymore.\n\nMy point is that accidents and problems can happen. We can prepare, but we cannot always solve our problems alone. We need help from others.\n\nI think we should not depend too much on the government. The government is not perfect. We should learn to help each other and ask for help. We should not build our own shelters alone.\n\nSome people say that Americans are strong and independent. But our ancestors were strong because they helped each other. They worked together. They shared food and resources. When pioneers traveled across the country, they did not go alone. They worked together.\n\nSo, be prepared. I have a disaster kit and food. I have flashlights and candles. But I also know my neighbors. You should know your neighbors too.",
            "Scientists want to know why living things change over time.  They are looking for rules that help explain how these changes happen.  Many years ago, a scientist named D'Arcy Thompson said that it is hard to use math to understand how living things develop.  Today, scientists are still trying.  A team of researchers is using math to study how shells of a type of animal called Prunum grow and change over time.\n\nThey are using X-rays to take pictures of the shells.  These pictures help them measure the shape of the shells.  They are then using a computer program to create pictures of what the shells might have looked like in the past or in the future.  This helps them understand how the shells changed over time.\n\nA shell is like a tube that grows in a spiral shape.  It turns around a center point called the columella.  The shell has lines called sutures that divide it into parts.  The last part of the shell is called the body whorl.  The other parts are called the spire.  The tip of the spire is called the apex, and the other end is called the base.  The shell has an opening called the aperture, and the animal comes out of this opening.\n\nThere are four ways to look at a shell: from the top (apical), from the bottom (basal), from the front (apertural), and from the back (abapertural).  Usually, people look at the shell from the front.\n\nTo count the turns of the shell, you look at it from the top and find the first line that divides the shell.  Then you draw a line and count the turns from there.  Each turn is divided into four parts.\n\nThe shell is like a path that the animal follows as it grows.  You can find the path by looking at the center of each turn and the size of the turn.  This path can be shown on a graph and mathematically explained.  Once you have the math, you can change the rules and see how the shell would grow differently.",
            "The number of babies and young children dying in Indonesia has not changed much in the last ten years.  The country is making progress in some areas, such as making sure people have clean water and sanitation.  However, the progress in health care for mothers and children is not fast enough to meet its goals by 2015. \n\nMany reasons are behind this problem.  We will look at these reasons and see that Indonesia needs to make its health system stronger instead of just focusing on special health programs.\n\nIndonesia has made some improvements.  More births are now attended by trained health workers.  But this number includes traditional workers like midwives who may not have the skills to help in emergency situations.  This means that many mothers are still dying from problems during delivery.  The health system still needs a lot of work.\n\nFewer children under five are getting medical help for diarrhea.  We do not have complete information about how well new mothers are being taken care of after childbirth.  But it is clear that this area needs more attention.\n\nFewer women are having cesarean sections than we would expect.  And the number of cesarean sections is very different between cities and rural areas.  This shows that people in cities have better access to healthcare.  The poor have a hard time getting medical help, often because they cannot afford it.\n\nTo improve health care for mothers and babies, the next question is: how can we best solve the problem of not having enough medical services?  Should Indonesia create special programs to help specific areas of health care, or should it focus on making its overall health system stronger?  We know that special programs can be helpful.  They have clear goals and can produce quick results.  But there are also some problems with this approach.  For example, when we give too much money to one area of health care, other areas may not get enough money or workers.  This can happen when we give a lot of money to one area and not enough to others.  We also have a problem with many programs working in the same area and not coordinating with each other.  This can make it hard for people to get the services they need.",
            "Two Victorian novels are different from others of their time. They are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These novels are not like other Victorian novels. They have mystery and strange things that happen. This makes the characters more interesting. It helps us understand their thoughts and feelings.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, strange things happen to Oliver. He sees things that are not real. These things show us what he is thinking and feeling. He has a lot of pain and fear.\n\nOne time, Oliver was shot. He remembers it like a dream.

            "I worked with a group of students after school two years ago. I helped them with their schoolwork. I was good at helping them with English and reading. A teacher asked me to work with a boy named Adrian. He was having trouble reading. Some letters were easy for him, but others were hard. He spoke perfect English, but he was not sure about the alphabet. I thought something was strange.\n\nI met Adrian's mother when she came to pick him up. She did not speak much English. We spoke a little Spanish, but it was hard for me. Then I understood the problem. Adrian could read, but he did not know the English alphabet well. I hope he is doing better now.\n\nI tell this story to show that language can be a problem in school. Even if a child speaks good English, reading can still be hard. We all agree that this is a problem. So, what can we do? For Adrian, the answer was simple. He needed help with his alphabet and pronunciation. But for other children who do not speak much English, the answer is more complicated.\n\nWe need to try different things. We can use the dual language system. This means teaching children in two languages. We can also have special classes for children who need help with English. But one thing is not enough. We need to use all of these things together.\n\nThe dual language system is a good idea. It helps children learn two languages. This can make them smarter and do better in school. Some people are afraid of this idea. They think it is a waste of money and that only some children will benefit. But this is not true. If we use this system for all children, they will all benefit.\n\nSo, how do we do this? Do we need all teachers to speak two languages? No, that would be hard. But we can have special helpers who speak two languages. They can work with teachers to help children learn.",
            "Most people learn as children that there is something bigger than they are. We call this something \"God.\" Some people go to Sunday school to learn about God. Others visit the Temple or look inside themselves for answers. Many people accept the ideas about God that their parents teach them. But some people do not believe in God. They think there is no life after death. We choose our own way to think about God. We try to understand ourselves by looking at our own ideas. We want to find meaning in life.\n\nMy father liked cardinals. He said so when I asked him. We sat on our porch, listening to the rain. Our house was old, and the tin roof made a loud sound. My father looked out at the rain. He looked sad and worried. He was not eating well, and his clothes were loose. His hair was thinning. I was afraid to talk to him about how I felt. I was afraid it would make things worse. So I hugged him and sat with him in silence.\n\nMy father died in December. He was sick for a long time. The doctors gave him medicine to help him feel better, but it did not work. My birthday was five days before he died. I was sad and alone. I thought about God, but I did not want to talk to him. If God was real, I thought, he had stopped listening to me a long time ago.\n\nI did not want to watch my father die. So I did not. I wanted to remember him as he was, not as he was when he was sick. I knew my father better than anyone. He would not have wanted me to be sad. I stayed in my bed for three days, waiting to hear the news. But no one called me.",
            "The Gothic Novel is a mix of old and new ideas. It is like an oxymoron, as Ian Watt says in \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel.\" People have given the Gothic mode many different opinions. Some think it is not deep, while others praise it for creating a feeling of fear and awe. \n\nThe first Gothic Novel, \"The Castle of Otranto,\" was written by Horace Walpole. It used old and new ideas from romances to create a new way to write stories. Walpole took old theatrical ideas and combined them with new things from modern novels. He called it \"A Gothic Story.\" The Gothic genre uses many old ideas from medieval times, such as theater, architecture, and traditions.\n\nAt the time of \"The Castle of Otranto,\" the word \"gothic\" was used to describe many things, people, and time periods. People thought it was old-fashioned and not sophisticated compared to modern society and literature. The combination of old and new things in the Gothic genre is what made it last a long time and seem both old and new to readers.\n\nOne important idea in Gothic novels is chivalry. Chivalry is the idea of training a good knight. It is kept and changed in \"The Castle of Otranto.\" Chivalry is important because it represents the ideal of a brave, honorable, and competent knight. Gothic writers, like Walpole, wanted to show that this ideal was missing in their society. They used the chivalric ideas to make the past seem better and to suggest that people could be better. Walpole wrote \"The Castle of Otranto\" during a time of trouble in politics. He was unhappy with the future and thought that people had lost the good qualities of the past. He showed this in his character, Frederic, who is a prince, has suffered, and is supposed to be dead. He is like a gallant and courteous knight, but also exaggerated, which is a new idea in the Gothic genre.",
            "Supply chain management is the process of moving goods from making raw materials into finished products. This process includes getting a customer's order, making the raw materials into products, and delivering the products to the customer. The idea of supply chain management was first used in 1982 by a business expert named Keith Oliver. He said it is a way to plan, control, and carry out the steps in the supply chain to satisfy customers quickly and efficiently.\n\nThere are six important parts of a supply chain: making products, getting raw materials, storing products, finding the right place to make products, moving products, and sharing information. Business managers use these six parts to give the best service to customers.\n\nFirst, making products is the first step in the supply chain. It is the base of the whole process. When deciding what to make and how to make it, managers need to know what customers want. To find out what customers want, managers look at the market. The market is a good indicator of what customers need.\n\nOnce managers know what customers want, they can decide what products to make and how many to make. They must also decide where to make the products and which factory will work best. This decision is based on how many products to make and how good the products will be. The customer's needs and satisfaction are very important.\n\nAfter deciding where to make the products, managers focus on planning work and taking care of equipment. Making products is a very important step in the supply chain. Every detail is important, and if not done correctly, it can cost a lot of money and time in the long run. For example, companies like Wal-Mart and Target have a plan for every part of their business. They have a plan for how employees should dress and how to receive shipments from trucks. Having a plan helps companies work smoothly and avoid mistakes.\n\nThe second important part of supply chain management is getting raw materials. This means making strategic decisions to decide what a factory can do well and what should be done by other companies. A company may have different groups that make different parts of a product. The manager must decide which group is best for each part. Managers may also decide to work with other companies to make parts. This can help create efficiency and save money.",
            "A sign in Burma says Hitler is alive.\n\nEllen Page, a famous actress, holds a sign on a street corner. The sign says a strange thing: \"Hitler is alive.\" Burma is a country in Southeast Asia. A group of strong men, the military, controls the country. They took power in 1962 in a violent act. In 2007, people in the street began to protest. The protesters were led by Buddhist monks. They wore special red robes. The people's protests were called \"The Saffron Revolution.\" The government agreed to let the monks meet peacefully, but then the violence started. The military attacked the monks and destroyed their homes. Some news reporters were arrested and put in jail. One reporter from Japan was killed in September 2007. The government said 13 people died, but a colonel who left the army said many more people died.\n\nThis has happened before. Many governments want to control their people and stop them from protesting. This has been happening since ancient times. Long ago, some Roman leaders said they were gods and had complete control. Some Japanese leaders were thought to be gods. Today, the leader of the United States talks to a man who leads a group of people who do not agree with others.\n\nWe have seen many examples of this. In 1989, people in China protested against their government. Many people died. Some said 200-300 died, but others said 2,000-3,000 died. In the 1990s, a group of people in Rwanda killed many others. They were from a different group. Hitler's rule in Germany was another example. He and his men killed many Jewish people.",
            "Duke Ellington's influence on jazz is very big. He was able to create music for a long time, and this helped him to be creative. He made his orchestra sound very good. In many of his compositions, Ellington plays the piano quietly, but as a composer, he is very good at writing music that lets the band members show off their skills. He wrote the framework for the band to play freely, and he also wrote tightly planned pieces that used the special style of each band member to add musical ideas. This made the orchestra sound good together and created new and original music. Ellington knew the sound of each band member and how they fit together, and this helped him to write some of the most creative and wonderful jazz music in history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary says that Ellington's sound is special because he used the voice as a musical instrument. One good example of this is Creole Love Call. In this song, Ellington used the voice to add sound and color. He did not use lyrics, which made it easy to hear the music. This song also shows how Ellington liked to work with the style of each band member. It is a slow song with a repeated pattern of 12 bars. There are six parts to the song:\n\n1. The voice and reeds talk to each other, with the voice starting smooth and then getting rougher.\n2. A trumpet solo that makes the basic melody sound better and adds long, sad notes.\n3. A clarinet solo that is very high and has a special piano sound.\n4. The whole band repeats the first part, with the brass and reed sections talking to each other.\n5. The climax of the song, where the reeds talk to each other in a high voice, and the brass and rhythm sections play a special kind of music.\n6. The song goes back to the first part, with the voice and reeds talking to each other again. This time, the voice sounds like a special instrument.\n\nEllington liked to use the voice to add color to his music, and this is one of the things that makes his music special.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, Ellington uses his skill at planning the music and his ear for sound to create a special sound. He makes a call and response between a trumpet player named Bubber Miley and a singer named Baby Cox. They use the sound of Miley's playing and the singing of Cox to create a rich and good sound. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) uses these ideas, too. Ellington uses a trombone player named Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to introduce the melody in a special way.",

The study used a special diet called the \"Mediterranean Diet.\" This diet includes a lot of fruits, nuts, whole grains, and fish. It has less animal products and saturated fats. Drinking some alcohol is okay.\n\nPrevious studies showed that people who eat this diet are less likely to die from heart disease. Another study showed that this diet helps people lose weight and lower their bad cholesterol levels.\n\nThis study followed 74,886 women between 38 and 63 years old.

They looked at the number of heart disease and stroke cases over 20 years. They also looked at the number of deaths from heart disease and stroke.\n\nThe study found that women who ate a lot of the Mediterranean foods were less likely to get heart disease and stroke.

            "The United States had a big financial problem in 2007. Many people lost their jobs, the housing market fell, and some big companies failed. This problem is still happening today. We need to understand how this problem started and how to stop it. The financial problem was caused by bad decisions made by the government. They made banks and companies make loans to people who could not pay them back. This was a big mistake because the country's financial system was not strong enough. Two companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were forced to buy and sell these bad loans. When people could not pay back these loans, the banks did not have enough money. They sold these bad loans to other people, which made the problem worse.\n\nThis problem started many years ago, in 1999. The President wanted to win another term in office. He made a rule to make it easier for people to get loans to buy houses. This rule helped create the problem that happened seven years later. In 1999, the New York Times reported, \"Fannie Mae wants to help people with low income get loans to buy houses.\" But the reporter warned, \"This could be a problem if the economy gets worse.\" He was right. The government helped Fannie Mae, but it made a big mistake.\n\nMany things made the economy worse. Banks made new kinds of loans that were not good. They were called adjustable-rate mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. These loans made the economy more connected to the housing market. Many people and companies borrowed too much money to buy houses. They were not ready for a problem in the housing market. When the housing market fell, many people and companies failed.\n\nThe five biggest investment banks in the United States had $4.1 trillion in bad loans in 2007. This was 30% of the country's money. Some big banks like Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers failed. Others like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to become regular banks with strict rules. Fannie and Freddie had $5 trillion in bad loans and were taken over by the government in 2008.",
            "Exposition is a part of writing that can be tricky.  It's the place in your story where you explain a lot about the characters and the world they live in. But too much exposition can be boring.\n\nYou know, \"show, don't tell\" is a basic writing rule. But even with that in mind, it's easy to fall into the trap of writing too much exposition. This can happen when you want to tell the reader too much about your characters and their world.\n\nLet's look at an example. Imagine you are reading a story and you are told that the main character met her husband at a certain time and place, and they got married in a big ceremony. But then you are told even more - that he was murdered in front of her. This can take up a lot of space in the story, and it's not very exciting.\n\nA better approach is to show this part of the story instead of just telling it. For example, you could show how much the husband loves his wife through his actions and words. You could also show how much his presence in her life changed her, by showing how she thinks and feels about him. This would make the reader care about him and be sad when he dies.\n\nThe key is to add details that make your story come alive. Instead of just saying \"They met, they married, he died,\" you could make the reader feel like they are a part of the story. This will keep them interested and engaged.\n\nAs a writer, you need to balance telling the reader what's happening with showing them. It's easy to get carried away with exposition, but it's better to give the reader a taste of the story and let them fill in the rest with their imagination.",
            "I watched two television news programs from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was on NBC 4 this morning. The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who hurt his wife very badly. His name is Shad Hostettler. The police arrested him. The news program showed his picture. He looked very bad. They talked about this story for two minutes because it was still happening. I think they used the right amount of time for this story.\n\nThe second story was about a young man named Travis Buyers. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area. He was 18 years old and very sick from his injury. The police were looking for the person who did this, but they did not know who it was. I noticed that this story was short. I think this might be because the man who was shot is black. I have seen this happen many times before. When a white person is hurt or missing, the news spends a lot of time on it. But when a black person is hurt or missing, the news does not talk about it as much.\n\nThe next story was about a helicopter that was shot. The police found a hole in it and think it was shot with a .22 caliber rifle. The police are offering a reward for information that can help them catch the person who did this.\n\nThe next story was about the weather. It will be hot and rainy on Saturday. The temperature will be in the mid 80s. They wanted to keep us watching, so they made it a short story.\n\nThey also talked about a store that was robbed. A black man took money from the store. He was wearing a dark hoodie and was about six feet tall and 150 pounds. They spent a lot of time talking about how black he was.\n\nAnother story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez. He was a big dealer of marijuana. He was caught and will be in prison for 25 years. They said he was Hispanic, but I do not think that was important to the story.",
            "There is a strong connection between brothers. This connection is very strong and cannot be broken. Inside this connection are many feelings: love, pride, jealousy, and anger. Brothers know each other very well. They can see themselves in their brother. When a bad situation happens, the true nature of this connection is clear. This connection can bring both good and bad things. When we understand the feelings that come from this connection, we must accept the results of these feelings. When we look at our brother, we see our own self. We see how others do not see us, but how we really are. Our actions and the results of these actions show our true character.\n\nIn the story \"The Scarlet Ibis\", two brothers show this connection and the strong emotions that come with it. The story takes place in a beautiful and vivid place. The two boys go on a difficult journey. Disappointment and pride are very strong in one scene. Only one brother survives. The story shows this connection through the main character, Doodle, and the way he interacts with his brother. The writer also tells us about the feelings of the main character and his view of the world. These feelings affect his actions.\n\nThe main character feels one main emotion: pride. He was angry at his brother Doodle from the beginning. He wanted a brother to teach and play with. He wanted someone to go on adventures with. But Doodle was very sick. He could not do the things the main character wanted. The main character was very sad and angry when he realized this. In fact, he even thought about hurting Doodle. But when Doodle smiled at him, he felt love for his brother. This shows that he really did love Doodle.",
            "The human brain is a very complicated and creative system that helps us process information. The way we talk about the brain has changed as technology has improved. At first, people compared the brain to a piece of wax, then to a piece of paper, then to a book, and now to a computer. But these comparisons are not perfect and can lead to misunderstandings.\n\nThe brain processes information in a very special way. First, it takes in information from our senses. Our senses are like special tools that help us feel, see, hear, touch, or taste things. The brain takes this information and changes it into signals that it can understand.\n\nThe brain uses two ways to process information. One way is to start with small pieces of information and put them together to understand something new. This is like building a puzzle. For example, when you look at a picture of a black box, you start by seeing the colors and the lines. Then, your brain puts these pieces together to understand that you are looking at a box.\n\nThe other way is to use information that you already know to help you understand something new. This is like using a map to find your way. If you see a picture of a black box, your brain might use what it already knows about boxes to help you understand what you are looking at.\n\nThe brain also has a special filter that decides what information is important and what you should pay attention to. For example, when you look at the grass, your brain does not notice each individual blade. But if someone calls your name, you hear it clearly.\n\nInformation in the brain is stored in three kinds of memory: short-term, working, and long-term. Short-term memory stores information for a short time, like 20 seconds. Working memory is like a computer that stores information while it is being used. Long-term memory stores information for a long time.\n\nThe brain processes and stores information in different ways. Some scientists study how people remember things, while others study how computers work, or how the brain itself works. One way to understand how the brain works is to think of it like a network of connections. These connections help us understand how we remember things. For example, if you think of a chair, your brain might connect it to other things like a table or wood.",
            "Aldous Huxley writes a book called Brave New World. It is a story about a future world where people value being happy more than anything else. They are taught from a young age to be happy and not to think deeply about anything. The people in this world are not in charge. A group called the World Controller decides what is best for them. Huxley thinks this is a bad system.\n\nHe uses ideas from a man named Karl Marx to show how this system is not good. Marx said that when people work for a company, they do not have control over their lives. They work only for a salary. Huxley's book says the same thing. The people in the story do not think about how they are treated. They are happy to buy things and enjoy themselves.\n\nHuxley is also saying that this system makes people not think for themselves. They are controlled by the World Controller. The people in the story are like pawns in a game. They do not have any power. They are only happy to do what they are told.\n\nIn the story, there are different classes of people. The classes are like groups. Some people are more powerful than others. But the people in the lower classes do not know they are not in control. They are happy to be like everyone else. Some people are born with more power than others. But they do not use their power to help others.\n\nHuxley is saying that this system is not good. People should be able to think for themselves and make their own choices. They should not be controlled by someone else. In the story, people do not have deep relationships. They do not love each other. They only care about how they look and what they own.\n\nThe people in the story are happy to do what they are told. They do not question anything. This is like what Marx said about people who work for a company. They do not have control over their lives. They are only happy to get a paycheck.\n\nHuxley's book is a warning about the dangers of this system. He thinks it is not good for people. We should be able to think for ourselves and make our own choices.",
            "I am a student at University Park. I have been here for two and a half years. It can be hard to get around the campus. My freshman year, I was in a dorm room in East Halls, near the end of campus. I had to walk a long way to get to classes in the Willard building, near the center of campus. This walk could take 25 minutes, especially in bad weather. I talked to an old friend. He said he stopped riding a bike for a few years, but now he rides one again. He said, \"Bikes are great. They are the best way to get around.\" Riding a bike is good for your body. It is also the best way to travel. If you eat breakfast and ride a bike, you can go 30 miles or more. I live off campus now. I decided to buy a bike. It was a good decision. I ride my bike to class every day. I have a class in Thomas building. It is a 25-minute walk from my home. But if I ride my bike, it takes only 5 minutes. The road to Thomas building is not always easy to ride on. But I need my bike. If I didn't have one, I would have to walk. Walking would take an extra 30-40 minutes every day. This is two and a half hours every week. I am too busy to walk. I need my bike to get to class on time."
